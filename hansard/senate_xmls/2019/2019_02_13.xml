                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the motion that I have moved the suspension with respect to. We've moved this motion this morning because the opposition believes that, given the events in the House of Representatives yesterday, the issue should be given precedence over all other business until it is resolved. The volatility in this place just highlights that further. The House of Representatives yesterday made amendments to the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018 that was considered in the Senate on the final sitting day of 2018. These amendments mean that the government must now listen to advice of doctors about whether sick refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island should be evacuated to Australia for medical care.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor worked with the crossbench members of the other place to secure important amendments to strengthen this bill. Labor has been doing the same thing in the Senate and has been working closely with senators across the crossbench to make sure these amendments are supported in both houses of parliament. The passing of these amendments in the House yesterday afternoon marked the first time a government has lost a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives in 90 years. This is a significant event and one that surely means the issue deserves priority consideration this morning in the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hysterical response from the Liberal government to the events of the House of Representatives just shows how desperate they are. We have a dangerous and volatile Prime Minister. The attempts of the government today to prevent this issue from being dealt with as a matter of priority show they are just scared of losing another vote. They are a government that is divided. They are a government in chaos. They are a government—put simply—out of control. The government cannot be surprised that this matter would be atop our priority list in the Senate today. The government could have been the ones to list this issue the first time this morning, but instead we have business as usual—the Labor Party managing the program from opposition, something we have seen consistently now for some time. I urge senators to support this suspension. Let this chamber have the debate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HDA" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CORMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:38</span>):  The government will not be supporting this motion. What this motion by the Labor Party shows to the Australian people is just how cocky, how reckless, how irresponsible and how weak Bill Shorten is as leader of the Labor Party. Bill Shorten is demonstrating to all Australians that he does not have the strength of character or the good judgement required to be Prime Minister of Australia. In pursuit of a short-term tactical political advantage, he has decided to compromise our national security and to compromise our border protection arrangements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Labor is doing here today is trying to ram legislation through the Senate which will weaken our border protection arrangements. Let's just remind ourselves what the Labor Party tried to do in the Senate—very incompetently, I might add—back in December. Back in December, the Labor Party tried to ram legislation through the Senate which Bill Shorten yesterday had to admit would have denied the opportunity for the government to turn away criminals from Australia and would have put the pull factor back at the heart of our border protection arrangements, which of course is the product that the people smugglers want to sell. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did Bill Shorten move amendments yesterday? Because, having failed to ask for security advice from our national security agencies and with a failed gag motion in the Senate in December last year, he convinced his Labor senators in this chamber to support legislation which, he had to admit in the end, would have put our border security arrangements at serious, serious risk. Let me just say that the ALP amendments that were passed by Labor, the Greens and the crossbench in the House of Representatives yesterday still leave Australia exposed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some of the kinds of people the minister would be forced to bring to Australia on the say so of doctors under the Labor amendments: people charged with bad conduct but not convicted of offences under foreign laws or convicted but sentenced to less than 12 months in prison. Plenty of countries hand down lenient sentences for things like beating your wife or paedophilia, if they hand down any sentence at all. It is very hard to convict people of things like rape in some countries because women's testimony is worth much less than that of men. A person charged but not sentenced for, say, murder or paedophilia on Nauru will not be caught by the exemption. Australian security agencies may be well aware of a person engaging in paedophilia on Nauru but the person need not have been charged or sentenced. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The upshot is that, as a result of Bill Shorten's bill—and it will be on his head—rapists, murderers and paedophiles will still get a free pass into this country. Bill Shorten should be ashamed of himself. It includes people involved in criminal organisations. A person may be a member of a criminal drug-dealing gang, for example. It includes people reasonably suspected of people smuggling. These are all people that would be forced onto Australia courtesy of legislation that Labor is seeking to ram through the Senate. It includes people whose general past conduct shows they are not of good character. For example, it includes people who consort with criminals, people whose bad conduct is not criminalised in the relevant home jurisdiction, people who have been convicted of a lot of low-level offences, people who have been fighting guards in Nauru or Manus, people who have touched up nurses, people who have threatened violence and people who have bragged about going into crime and drug dealing when they get to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the people that the Labor Party, together with the Greens, wants to bring into Australia. It includes people who have incited racial discord on Nauru or Manus and people who pose a risk of doing the following in Australia: engage in criminal conduct in Australia; or harass, molest, intimidate or stalk another person in Australia; or vilify a segment of the Australian community; or incite discord in the Australian community or in a segment of that community; or represent a danger to the Australian community or to a segment of that community, whether by way of being liable to become involved in activities that are disruptive to, or in violence threatening harm to, that community or segment, or in any other way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Australian people can now see the cockiness of Bill Shorten; they can see his arrogance, as well as his recklessness and his absolute weakness in standing up for our national interests. Bill Shorten has not learned from the failures of the Rudd Labor government. Kevin Rudd thought that he could be tough and soft at the same time. Of course, the disastrous results were there for all to see: 1,200 deaths at sea. Labor are at it again. This time they don't even want to wait for an election.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:46</span>):  I rise to speak in support of this suspension, because today is such an important day for the many millions of Australians who are fighting for a return to a more decent, a more compassionate, a more caring Australia, and we stand with them!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make this point: indefinite detention of innocent people in offshore prisons is wrong. It is wrong. Depriving innocent people of their liberty and depriving them of hope is wrong. Denying medical treatment to innocent people in our care is wrong! The fact that we're even debating whether we should be denying innocent people access to medical care shows you how far down this dark path we have come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't a question of politics. This isn't a question of law. This is a question of basic human decency. This goes to the essence of how we treat our fellow human beings—of who we are as a nation. Right now we are engaged in the politics of fear and division. This is a taste of what is to come in this election campaign, where we see a government with nothing other than fear and division—a government with no plan to tackle climate change, no energy policy, no plan to increase wages, no plan to tackle the housing crisis—turn to the old trusted toolbox where fear and division is the pathway to winning an election. That's what this is about. That's what this government seeks to do. I fear for what the next few months have in store for the Australian community—turning people against each other, when we should be appealing to people's better nature, when we should be giving people an Australia they can believe in, an Australia that is compassionate and decent towards innocent human beings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long—for months now—we have been debating in this parliament whether the people on Manus Island and Nauru can get access to the medical care that they need. The government's proposition is this: that we should harm innocent people—that we should deny them a fundamental right, which we've accepted not just here in Australia but right around the world, that anybody who is sick should get access to decent medical care. This is a basic human right. Yet we have a government saying: 'We are going to deny people this human right in an effort to send a message to someone else; we will harm the innocent to send a message to someone else.' That is a principle we don't accept in any other part of our justice system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw at the end of last year was some decency finally being injected in this debate. We saw the medical community, the AMA, the medical colleges, refugee advocates, human rights lawyers and, indeed, brave members of the crossbench joining with the Greens and then the Labor Party, to finally stand up and say: 'No more! We are not going to accept the harm that is being inflicted on innocent people.' And this basic, simple principle that we have accepted up until this point, which is that sick people get access to medical care, should be something we stand up for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That this is even a matter of debate shows you how far we have come. I fear that this bill still is not certain to pass. We will find that out in the coming moments. But the fact that this bill is now before the Senate again is in part because we saw the Labor Party decide to make changes to a bill they supported several months ago. That's why this bill has now returned to the Senate. We played a critical role in ensuring that this bill remained integral in terms of ensuring that people get access to medical care, and we now are fully supportive of what's being put before the Senate, but the reality is this: never before have Australians seen why they need to have the Greens in the Senate—indeed, more independent voices in our parliament. It is because, when pressure comes to bear on the major parties, they listen to those people with the deepest pockets and with the biggest megaphones, rather than standing up for decency. And that's what this bill is about. It's about ensuring fundamental decency is once again returned to this policy that has inflicted so much harm on so many people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="D2I" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIFIELD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  The first point I need to make is that it has always been the convention in this place that the government of the day has the opportunity to lay out the program for legislation during government business time. I can well remember Senator Collins fiercely defending that proposition when she was on this side of the chamber. It is the convention in this place that the government of the day lay out the legislative program in this place, so we cannot support the suspension motion to alter that convention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we also saw was an absolute shambles on the part of those opposite when it came to seeking to move the suspension motion. That reflects what has been a real lack of care and a real lack of attention when it comes to the Phelps bill at all stages. Those opposite and many on the crossbench voted for that bill in this place at the end of last year without having received any legal advice as to its constitutionality in terms of what was sent to the other place, and we saw that play out over there. They also voted for the legislation without receiving any security briefing, not because it wasn't available but because they didn't think it necessary to seek that before voting on the legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been no care. There has been no thought. There has been no concern about the protection of our borders and what the practical, real-world impact will be if this piece of legislation is passed. What those opposite are seeking to do is to give the people smugglers a product that they can sell. When we came into office we systematically put back in place that which those opposite had dismantled. We broke the people smugglers' business model. Those opposite want to give the people smugglers a product to sell. They want to provide a pipeline for the people smugglers to convey people on the high seas, putting forward the proposition that they can deliver an outcome for those that the people smugglers want to sell to. We cannot support that for one second.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the core business of the elected executive government of the day to protect our borders. That is something that should never ever be outsourced to anyone. It should never be outsourced to anyone. It is the responsibility of the elected executive government of the day. The Phelps bill seeks to outsource that solemn responsibility of government—in this case, to doctors. We have a high regard for doctors, but it's governments who are elected to discharge these duties. Also, the bill is based on a fundamentally false premise, that medical facilities and medical services are not available to those who are offshore. They are available to those who are offshore, and when they need services that aren't available there then that occurs. So this legislation is based on an absolutely false premise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that those opposite and those looking to support the bill fail to recognise and acknowledge is the existence of something called pull factors. There are pull factors. There are push factors and there are pull factors. We saw that when Mr Rudd was putting himself forward to be Prime Minister of the nation. That government at that time essentially said that pull factors don't exist; it's only push factors. Well, pull factors do exist, and they are a core part of what people smugglers sell. It's a core part of what people smugglers put to people—that they can deliver an outcome. What they use for their marketing purposes are those things that the Australian Labor Party say and those things that the Australian Labor Party do and those things that the Greens say and those things that the Greens do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see now is that the Labor Party have given up any pretence of there being bipartisanship when it comes to border protection. They've broken cover, and the Australian people have the opportunity to see where they stand.</span>

Well, do you know who has stopped pretending? Mr Morrison has stopped pretending even to be Prime Minister. He can't even pretend to be Prime Minister. He's Prime Minister in name only. He's leading a government that is so riven by chaos and division, it has no agenda and no positive plans for the Australian people. If you needed any display of that, have a look at the House yesterday—the first government since 1929 to lose a vote on the floor of the House on its own legislation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember the many positions this government has taken on the bill that is before the chamber, or the message that is reported. First Mr Morrison said, 'It's a stupid bill. It's superfluous.' Then this government, in a shameful act, leaked classified national security information in an attempt to undermine it. Then the government whipped out of the Prime Minister's pocket some advice saying it is unconstitutional, and, when the government lost the vote, suddenly it didn't matter again. So one minute it's superfluous and the next it's the end of the world. One minute it's a constitutional crisis and the next it's irrelevant. Do you know what this is? It is a pattern of deceit. It's a pattern of deceit and desperation from a man who is desperate to cling to office, a man who has nothing left but deceit, fear and smear. At least we have had the leaking of classified security information by this government being referred to the AFP. Scott Morrison wants to manufacture a fight because fear is all you lot have left. You can't campaign on your record, because your record is chaos and cuts. You can't campaign on stability, because you're busy fighting each other.</span>

                  </a>  Mr Morrison's speech this week really confirmed that he has no agenda on the things that matter to the lives of the people we represent—nothing on schools, nothing on Medicare, nothing on hospitals, nothing on the NBN, nothing on wages, certainly nothing on climate change, and nothing about what he would do to fix the banks. It is very clear this government has nothing left but a fear campaign.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the message and the bill that is before the chamber, Labor has always made clear that we believe it is possible to have strong border security policy but also to ensure that the people who we have a responsibility for who are ill and sick are treated appropriately by medical practitioners. Our two clear objectives have been making sure that sick people get the care they need and making sure that the minister has the final discretion when it comes to medical transfers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will never let the people smugglers back in business. We have been clear that we support offshore processing, turnbacks when safe to do so and regional resettlement—and we are responsible. You don't see us leaking classified information for political purposes—a completely shameful act by those opposite, by those who represent those opposite. We act on advice from agencies, as demonstrated in the constructive negotiations and the amendments which were put and agreed to against the votes of the government in the lower house. Those amendments enhance the security arrangements, extend the time frame of the government to refuse transfers and ensure that this legislation is ring-fenced. They will only apply to a fixed number of people who are already in regional processing. The bill requires the government to listen to the advice of doctors. It is not prospective and, of course, this legislation will continue the practice where people who are transferred for medical care will continue to be held in detention as a default and only the minister can approve their release.</span>

They are led by a desperate Prime Minister, who is leading a bitterly divided government. He is clearly only concerned about one thing: clinging on to his job. That is the only thing this has always been about.

The supercilious and the sanctimonious on the other side need to acknowledge that because their own opposition have amended it. They realised there were flaws and failings in it, and they've amended it to try to put lipstick on a pig. And this is a pig of a policy, there's no doubt about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year in this Senate, when I said they would be allowing paedophiles, domestic violence proponents, rapists into the country, they dismissed it. They said: 'We don't care. We've got to be compassionate.' And now they've put in a modest little amendment saying, 'If you've been convicted of these offences, you won't be allowed in.' The problem is that those who are committing these heinous crimes in detention and on Nauru haven't been convicted. They haven't been convicted of it. Nor have those that have been doing it overseas, as Senator Cormann said, in countries where raping a woman is not such a big deal or where paedophilia is accepted. And these people on the other side are prepared to dismantle those protections because they want to get a cheap political win.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And if you want to talk about random politics, these people—the Labor Party, the Greens, those on the crossbench—are gambling with the protection and safety of innocents. Not the innocents that Senator Di Natale pretends to stick up for, not the so-called innocents who pay people smugglers to enter a country illegally, who are prepared to threaten or coerce or damage others in order to get a free ride to Australia, but the innocents that are the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor dismantled Australia's most successful policy on border protection, it cost the Australian people billions of dollars. More than that, it cost the Australian people their safety and security. You can have a look at the refugees that you, on the other side, let into the country that have damaged Australia. You've damaged Australia's welfare system. You've damaged Australia's national security. Twelve hundred people, at a minimum, lost their lives at sea because of policies that you and the Greens enacted. You should be ashamed of yourselves, because now you've opened the door once again to this insidious trade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the greatest act of sophistry I've ever seen, the Labor opposition and the Greens are saying, 'It won't matter; this is a one-off event and it's only to get some people who are in need off Nauru right now.' Well, Senator Di Natale says that doctors are going to release hundreds of people off Nauru. He didn't say it would be under spurious conditions, but I can guarantee it would be under spurious conditions. If you haven't got a mental health condition—or a claim to have one—on Nauru now, if this bill passes, it will mean you are actually mentally ill, because you're not gaming the system enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What are these people going to do when the people-smuggling trade resurrects itself and there are boatloads of people and they're being put on Nauru? How long before you capitulate again and allow another several hundreds or thousands of people to come to this country to rip off the system? You should be ashamed of yourselves. After years of defending our borders and standing at one with the government, you are now prepared to dismantle what we've got because you're worshipping at the altar of Green nonsense. It is just extraordinary. You are prepared to sacrifice Australia's national security and national prosperity. You are prepared to sacrifice Australia's taxpayers' funds because you have this ideological obsession that you should be repatriating people to this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know what is going to happen. If you bring someone to this country, all the lawyers, all the pro bono people, will stand up and tie this up in the courts, and you will effectively be granting them permanent residence again. It is a shame. It is an indictment. Use some common sense—bring it back to this country, because it's desperately needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  Order! Time for the debate has expired. I will now put the motion to suspend standing orders moved by Senator Collins which would allow her to move a precedence motion to deal with the motion that she has indicated she would like to move. The question is that the suspension motion moved by Senator Collins be agreed to. </span>

On this side of the chamber, the Liberal-National government, we understand that a federal government, the Commonwealth government of the people, has a fundamental responsibility to its nation and to its people, and, that is, of course, to maintain border security at all times. This government makes no excuses at all for the position that it takes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw last night in the House of Representatives was Bill Shorten, putting himself forward as the alternative Prime Minister of this country, and the Labor Party attempting to weaken Australia's borders from opposition. Imagine what will happen if Mr Shorten was ever elected as the Prime Minister of this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people have a very, very clear choice before them as we head towards a federal election. The Morrison government stands firm and makes no excuses for putting in place the border protection policies that have effectively stopped the people smugglers' trade. As the Prime Minister has stated, when it comes to border security in Australia there is no middle ground; there is only the right ground. You do not blink when it comes to border security, because to do so is to effectively capitulate to the people smugglers. You do not negotiate when it comes to border security. As Mr Howard has always said, the Australian government, the Liberal-National government, are firm believers: 'We will decide who comes to Australia and the terms upon which they come.'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are told that this bill will effectively not really have any effect on the current situation in relation to our borders, and yet we have the Leader of the Australian Greens happily telling people about it. As has been tweeted by a journalist this morning, Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, says he thinks doctors will send several hundred refugees to Australia for assessment or treatment under the bill passed yesterday—several hundred refugees. Unlike those opposite, who voted last year for this bill without the benefit of listening to our security agencies, we will always listen to our intelligence agencies, and their advice is clear: any weakening of our current border protection policies will reopen the people smuggling trade, and we will once again see the deaths at sea that we had last time, the children in detention and the reopening of detention centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to Senator Di Natale's boasting that doctors will be sending hundreds of refugees, this is the type of people who the minister will be forced to bring to Australia on the say-so of doctors under the Labor Party's amendments: people charged with bad conduct but not convicted of offences under foreign laws or convicted but sentenced to less than 12 months in prison. As we know, other countries do not have the stance we have in relation to certain crimes. A number of countries hand down lenient sentences for things like domestic violence—beating your wife—or paedophilia, if they hand down any sentence at all. It is very hard to convict people of things like rape in some countries because a woman's testimony is worth much less than a man's. A person charged but not sentenced to, say, murder or paedophilia on Nauru will not be caught by this exemption. There is a very important reason you stand firm on border protection, and the Morrison government will never blink.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">:</span>  This is the Home Affairs (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018, and it's important to get context here. It's a simple set of amendments to various pieces of legislation. The government, in its own chicanery, has caught itself out by failing to actually deal with what was a non-controversial bill, which it listed, delisted and listed again. It would normally have been done in non-controversial legislation last year—it was listed for some time—but it was, of course, caught up in the melee of last December. And now we have a set of circumstances where we've got some amendments moved to a bill which deal with the fundamental question—put aside all the palaver—of Australia's duty of care in terms of the provision of urgent medical support for people for whom we have direct responsibility insofar as our duty of care extends in circumstances where the medical support on Nauru, in particular, has not been good enough. It's a simple proposition. We've heard a shrill, irrational, hysterical approach from this government, who's prepared to say and do anything to cover up the facts—to cover up the facts, I repeat—to leak what they claim was to be these incredibly important security issues, to do whatever they need to, to lie and to deceive, and to just cover up the incredible chaos and dysfunction within this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this in this simple context. The great Achilles heel of this government's approach is some simple facts of life. Under this government, the minister said himself on TV last night that they have transferred a significant number of people here from Nauru 'either for medical attention or people in a family unit'. He said that, so I went and checked the figures. What we find is that some 460 people have been transferred from Nauru and Manus according to Senate estimates. Of course, various family members were transferred as well. Nearly 900 people have been transferred. Has that been a signal to the people smugglers? Has that led to the situation where our fundamental national security has been put at risk? Nine hundred people have been transferred under this government in circumstances where the government sought to keep it quiet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it seems to be the situation that if 900 people are transferred by this government, there's no threat to our borders and no threat to our national security, but if there's a proposition brought forward where we actually regulate the circumstances under which people are moved, for urgent medical treatment under strict supervision, under circumstances where the ministerial discretions are maintained, it actually improves the security that seems to be in deterioration. That's the claim that has been put to the Senate. We've actually got double the number of people being moved off the islands than are being moved to the United States. Double. Have we had an increase in the number of boats arriving? No. The evidence is clearly against the hysterical claims that this dysfunctional, chaotic government is seeking to make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nine hundred people are moved by this government, and the sky hasn't fallen in. But under these provisions we have proper medical supervision and independent medical advice, and the minister maintains his or her discretion to secure this country, we maintain our duty of care, yet this government tries to turn it on its head, given its own record. There is a fundamental lie at work here, which should be exposed by this Senate. I believe this Senate has a duty to support these amendments and support the message that has come back from the House of Representatives.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  This has been the toughest decision I've had to make since I came into this chamber. I can announce that I will be supporting the passage of these amendments today. When we voted for it last December, I was mainly concerned with getting children off Nauru. That has eventually happened, and for that I congratulate the government. But the medical aspects of Nauru and Manus are what have swayed me. I have been fully briefed by both sides of this parliament. I had a half-hour briefing with security forces this morning. I do have some doubts about some aspects of it. I'm glad that the 24 hours was pushed back by the Labor Party amendments, and it now goes to virtually 72 hours, and if you add things on to it it can get to one week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What really swayed me was the amendment, which I was surprised that the Greens agreed to, which was the one that it will apply only to people who are currently on Nauru or on Manus. That is a sort of reverse grandfathering; it stops there. It's not an encouragement, I believe, to people smugglers, who are despicable and should be despised, because it will only apply to people who are there. People who are transferred off Manus and brought back to Australia, according to the Department of Home Affairs—they assured me today—will remain in detention in some manner or form. So they will not come here and wander around the streets of Australia; they will come here for medical attention. I will acknowledge that the government has spent a lot more money on medical facilities on Nauru and on Manus, but there are conditions which cannot be taken care of there. The doctors who have worked there say there are some medical conditions and situations which cannot possibly be handled there, and they should be brought here.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am still perplexed about some aspects of it. I was quite happy to be accused of flip-flopping if I had gone the other way, because what we voted for in December, according to the Solicitor-General, might not even be constitutional. That was another aspect that came up yesterday. It has been a very tortured 24 hours. There's been a lot of pressure from a lot of people on all sides of the chamber, but that's part of this job. I don't need the full five minutes; I will give over to some people to talk. Now I can proudly say that, yes, I think it's the right decision. It's a humanitarian decision. In the Justice Party world, we have always tried to look after young people, old people and sick people. Well, all those three categories still apply in these amendments, and therefore I will be supporting them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018 is vitally important for refugees on Manus Island and Nauru who have now spent nearly six years detained indefinitely in those countries and who have suffered horrendously as a result. I've been to Manus Island five times and I've seen their suffering for myself. Medical treatment that they need and that the doctors believe that they need will now be available to them in Australia under this legislation. And that is a bare minimum that we should expect in a civilised society. But this bill is actually about so much more than just medical treatment, and its place in our country's history when we look back on this chapter in our collective story means a turning point in the divisive and toxic debate around refugees that's been in this place and this country at least since the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span> hove over the horizon nearly 20 years ago.</span>

The Senate voted for human decency, and in doing so it dealt a body blow to those toxic and divisive politics of fear. Yesterday, the house of assembly did the same: they voted for humanity and they voted for common decency, and in doing so, the House dealt a body blow to those toxic politics of fear and division that, ultimately, have caused deaths, sexual assaults, rapes and human suffering beyond the imagining of any senator for so many people on Manus Island and Nauru.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the Senate is going to confirm the decision that we made collectively late last year. This is a turning point for our country. When our national story is written, when the historians look at what's happened over the last 20 years and, arguably, longer, at the way that refugees and people seeking asylum have been demonised and deliberately harmed—and I genuinely hope that there will be a royal commission one day to get to the bottom of how we fell so far in this country—when historians are writing this dark and bloodied chapter in Australia's story, today and yesterday will be seen as pivotal moments where this parliament rose above that toxicity and voted for humanity and voted for decency.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018. These sick people in our care are now one step closer to getting the quality medical treatment they need without jeopardising our borders. I welcome the comments made by Senator Hinch and Senator McKim just now.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to be part of a process which has seen the Australian parliament really at its best in that none of those involved in the discussions which led to the amendments carried by the House of Representatives got everything they wanted. But members of a number of parties, as well as Independents, like myself, came together to achieve a result which should help sick people on Nauru and in PNG who are in our care get the medical attention they require. That's the key focus of the bill. These amendments would not have been necessary had the government not been using the courts to stop sick people coming from these countries to Australia for treatment on the advice of medical personnel.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments should now bring this heartless practice to an end and bring greater transparency and objectivity to the existing medical transfer process. We know that more than 800 sick people have already been brought to Australia for treatment without seeing the people-smuggling trade resume. There is no reason to believe that these amendments will change that, particularly with the changes agreed with the House crossbench yesterday. Let us all remember that the boat turn-back policy remains in place. The government should accept the decision of the majority of members of the House of Representatives and the Senate and allow these amendments through this chamber forthwith. The people of Australia will not thank them for any attempts to delay this considered and humane measure. I welcome the prospect of that measure today.</span>

That issue is that you cannot trust the Labor Party or the Greens on border control. They will always refer—always refer—to compassion, but where is the compassion in 1,200 people dying at sea? Let's talk about the availability of medical treatment on islands like Manus and Nauru. What medical treatment is available to the 1,200 people who have died and are on the bottom of the ocean? That's the issue we've got to look at today. Those that deny that this will start the boats again are denying the obvious. Isn't it a definition of absolute silliness to keep doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome? We've had this before. We've had this time and time again before, and we find the same outcome.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard the briefings. I've heard the well-intentioned comments that people around the chamber have made. There are no evil people talking on this issue. We are all compassionate people. My compassion, when I was appointed as the co-author of Operation Sovereign Borders, was to sit down and make an ethical decision, as I have many times in my life and in my military career. It is an ethical decision to have strong borders. If other countries in our region had borders as strong as ours, then of course we wouldn't need to be doing this, because people who arrive in those countries illegally would not be able to come to our country illegally. I have been an advocate, as has Mr Morrison, when he was the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, for strong borders throughout our region. Strong borders—as with good fences—make very, very good neighbours.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today really is an opportunity to talk about the wilful disregard that the opposition have demonstrated for Australia's border security. Yesterday evening's events in the House of Representatives are a very big, flashing warning sign about the simple and serious point that I make, and that is that you cannot trust the Labor Party on border security. Yes, as Senator Storer says, the boat turn-backs are still in place. Operation Sovereign Borders is still in place. Should the Australian people choose a new government, how long do you think that will stay in place? Who do you think Ms Kearney is going to back? Who do you think Sally McManus will put pressure on people to back? Is any one of the 30 people in the Labor Party caucus who have indicated they don't support turn-backs going to allow Mr Shorten to ever do a turn-back in any way, shape or form?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on the other side pose as champions of morality and the right things, but the policies they support lead to what is fundamentally an immoral outcome, because we know the outcome of this in the past and it remains highly likely to recur—I says it's inevitable, and it is also immoral. Rewarding people smugglers and those who are willing to break the law disregards the potential for more deaths at sea. The other side also makes the assumption that people detained always tell the truth. They never lie. They cannot feign sickness or invent claims about their backgrounds, and they should be taken at face value. This is a level of naivety which is mind-boggling, to say the least. Claims that there is no medical support on these islands are absolutely farcical. Time and time again, we have indicated what is there and, compared to an Australian town, how much more these people up there are getting than an Australian in similar circumstances.</span>

I saw this very, very closely from the inside, as well as being a co-author before the election. We had two years to achieve a good result. We could do it. We have a Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, who knows this inside out. We did it before. We can do it again in the future. I've seen this at close range. It does not work as soon as you lose resolve. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Anyone who cares about this country maintaining any form of border control against illegal immigrants, people smugglers and terrorists should be utterly opposed to this bill. The pretext that the illegal immigrants detained offshore need to come to Australia for medical treatment is utter nonsense. Medical care available on Nauru is excellent and is already vastly better than where these people came from. The real story is that these illegals will simply use this loophole to sneak into Australia with the assistance of the left-wing doctors. We know they will do this because they have already lied and cheated in an effort to jump the immigration queue, pretending to be asylum seekers when, in fact, they are just welfare seekers.</span>

This is about chardonnay socialists trying to demonstrate their smug sense of moral superiority over decent, hardworking Australians. It has to be said that those supporting the bills are engaged in left-wing virtue-signalling of the worst kind because it is placing at risk the integrity of Australia's borders. Don't take my word for it: that's what the Australian intelligence and security community tell us. This bill is just bogus, confected outrage looking for a cause. Anyone who isn't a dyed-in-the-wool leftist needs to consign this bill to the recycling bin.</span>

We all know it empowers doctors to select sick people to come to Australia and that this selection is subject to review by the Independent Health Advice Panel. We also know that family members can accompany sick people to Australia. But the bill also empowers doctors to select healthy people who are unrelated to the patient to come to Australia so as to accompany the patient. There is no review of this by the Independent Health Advice Panel. The expertise of doctors does not extend to determining who should accompany a patient to Australia. This power is ripe for abuse from doctors who think they are God. However, because of Labor taking over this chamber, no amendment to fix this egregious error can be moved. Those senators who vote for this bill will be voting for doctors determining which healthy people can come to Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="263418" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  Make no mistake: what we are seeing here is Labor and the Greens teaming up to weaken our border security and the sovereignty of this nation. We have seen it today. We saw attempts at it last year. There's no question about it. I listened to someone I respect and trust on the issue of border security, someone who knows what they are talking about, and that is Senator Molan. He know what's he's talking about. He has seen it firsthand. He spoke about the people who were the victims of the last Labor-Green government's border security policies, and that is what we are seeing—a return to those sorts of arrangements, which will undercut and undermine the security of this nation. Anyone who believes what's being said—that it isn't a weakening of our border security and that it doesn't change the policies—is being played for a fool.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They say: 'Trust us. Take us at our word.' But I think the best way to measure and test whether these people, the Australian Labor Party, propped up by their mates down here, the Australian Greens, can be trusted on border security—this is a group of people, too, I might remind those listening, who are seeking later this year to win the next election—is to check the record and see what happened when they were running the country and were actually in charge of our border protection policies. As we've heard countless times in this debate, 50,000 people arrived here during the time of the last government. There were 800 boats and up to 8,000 children forcibly put into detention as a result of their weak border policies. They go out there and they say it's about compassion and fairness and doing the right thing by disadvantaged people, but the only people who are getting something out of this are the people smugglers—the people who make money off the misery of others, the people who were the conduit for those people who paid money to come to this country, many of whom died at sea. We know of 1,200. How many more do we not know about? How many of those who pushed off from the shores of the lands they left and never made it here were never accounted for? As Senator Molan pointed out, what medical treatment is available for those people who fell victim, by way of death, to that awful policy?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So look at the record, see what they did last time they were in government, and then you will know where we are headed. This is the first step towards that awful set of arrangements which weaken our country's security and sovereignty. Those opposite are telegraphing their punches before they're even at an election. This is what they're going to be like. We will have weaker borders, and our country will be weaker for it. I urge all Australians—and senators contemplating how to vote on this—to think twice before they trust Labor or the Greens on this issue.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  I rise to speak on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill 2017. The bill before the Senate was first introduced in the other place on 25 October 2017 and passed on 12 February 2018. This week is the anniversary of the passing of this legislation from the other place. It should have been, but that is not the case. Labor supported the original bill in the other place and sought to progress this piece of legislation as non-controversial, as the bill had bipartisan support. The bill has been listed in the Senate on a number of occasions since February 2018, and, if it had come to a vote prior to May 2018, would have passed without this ill-thought-through amendment that seeks to implement a governance board. No coherent rationale has been provided by the government as to why the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, the APVMA, needs a governance board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that this bill was first introduced in October 2017 and passed the other place in February 2018 and that we are a year on, it is very important to look at the original intent of this bill as it was before this very ill thought out amendment before the Senate. The bill sought to make minor and technical amendments to a number of acts: the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994. The explanatory memorandum stated that the amendments would:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… realise operational efficiencies, reduce unnecessary regulation, clarify ambiguities and remove redundant provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other things that this bill sought to do. The bill has finally come to the Senate, but we have an amendment that seeks to implement a governance board on the APVMA. Initially, the reason was that the government would be replacing the advisory board with a governance board, which would position the APVMA to become a modern and sustainable regulator. Only someone kidding themselves would believe that statement. The idea that a governance board would achieve it is an absolute joke. If the government is serious about resetting the APVMA, it needs to have a serious look at the challenges that are currently facing the organisation due, as everyone in the Senate would know—it's been well discussed inside and outside parliament—to the forced relocation from Canberra to Armidale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must consult properly with industry and stakeholders who deal directly with the APVMA with regard to the establishment of the governance board. We know that the government has a poor record on properly consulting with industry and stakeholders. They themselves have amended their own amendment. During a public hearing by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee into the independence of regulatory decisions made by the APVMA departmental officers were found out to be either misleading the committee or unaware of the outcomes of consultations. They stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Industry have indicated to us that they're satisfied now and that they no longer have any objections to the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet the industry body for crop protection, when it was asked to confirm the department's position, made clear, at this stage:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No. We don't yet support the actual concept. We think that it needs to actually prove that it's going to deliver value as part of the broader structural changes in the regulatory system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By anyone's reckoning, that is not support for this move to introduce a governance board. I'm not sure how the department evidence came to be so wrong. Perhaps they were unaware of the outcomes of the consultations? But it is clear by that statement that they were very wrong in the information that they gave the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that, I feel that it is very important that I read the following into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> transcript so that the chamber understands there is not widespread industry support for the governance board. This is from a <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>transcript from 20 November 2018. The chair asked:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Can you tell us what process the department undertook to determine that the establishment of the governance board of the APVMA should be implemented via an amendment to an existing bill in the Senate?Ms Gaglia said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As we've stated, that was a decision by the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The chair then asked:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Just the minister. Is the department aware of any concerns from stakeholders relating to the implementation of the governance board, particularly with regard to perceived or actual interference in the independence of the APVMA?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Gaglia said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Certainly, up until the time we submitted the revised amendments, that was the case. Industry had made it quite clear to us that they had concerns that the way we had drafted the original amendments didn't make it clear enough that the board wouldn't be involved in the day-to-day regulatory decisions of the APVMA, hence why we've altered and revised the amendments. Industry have indicated to us that they're satisfied now and that they no longer have any objections to the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, later that day, the industry representative body for crop protection clearly stated that they do not support the creation of the board at 'this point in time'. Further on in the same committee, the chair then asked—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Cossey said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We're happy to look at all measures that will seek to improve the operational efficiency of the regulator. There are two issues here, and in the context of this inquiry it's why I make the point of separating them. One is about their scientific technical competency and the other is about their efficiency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Cossey went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have never been on the record criticising or questioning their scientific or technical competency, because they've never given us a basis to do so. We are on the record, in any criticisms of the APVMA that we have made, specifically as to efficiency and timeliness. My view is that the original bill, that is now being amended in the Senate, was an important bill. I understand it was supported by all sides of politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's correct. I mentioned that in the earlier part of my contribution here. Of course, it is important to again note that this bill has been hanging around since October 2017. Mr Cossey was quite right when he said that it was supported by all sides of politics. Then we have this extraordinary intervention by the government with this very ill-thought-out amendment that we're looking at today. Mr Cossey goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That should have proceeded as is and the issue of a governance board been dealt with as part of the second part of streamlining, with a broader look at all the measures that could be undertaken to improve the operational efficiency of the APVMA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The governance board. We believe it should be part of a broader efficiency package, that we look at how the whole agency works. I think it's important to note that the APVMA is not without a range of corporate governance oversight at the moment. There is the audit committee which is externally appointed and works with the CEO. There is a range of government committees in there. It is more that we would like to work through the issue as part of a range of other reforms.</span>

How will the governance board ensure that the APVMA's ICT operating environment recovers from the point of critical failure?

I believe it's very important to give confidence to the organisations that are stakeholders within the APVMA—to give confidence to them that the government will go back and introduce a standalone piece of legislation around the establishment of an APVMA governance board. This will allow the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill 2017 to pass the Senate ASAP.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We already know that, originally, that piece of legislation had bipartisan support. What we have now is an amendment—I think it's actually an amendment to an amendment—that the government has put in, in my view, without proper consultation and without a clear understanding of what stakeholders are saying out there. We've just heard, and I've just read into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, their views on it. Mr Cossey was very clear—he said it on a number of occasions—that they did not support the concept of a governance board at this point in time.</span>

It's clear that this hasn't been the case. They've had this bill, the original bill, hanging around since October 2017. It was passed in the House on 12 February 2018, so we're a year on. Now they've managed to really—I was going to say 'cock it up', but I'm not going to say that! So I urge the government to reconsider their position.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I also rise to speak on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill 2017. Overall, the Greens are in support of this bill, although with a few important caveats that I'll come to later on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the Greens don't always agree with the Productivity Commission, its final report <span style="font-style:italic;">Regulation of Australian agriculture</span>, which was published in March 2017, noted that despite numerous reviews and subsequent reforms there are concerns remaining about unnecessarily lengthy, complex and duplicative registration procedures. This, of course, has been exacerbated by the turmoil and the changes at the APVMA, which we have all known about for the last couple of years, but some of the problems go to things that can be fixed with minor changes to this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would improve the ability of the APVMA to go back to proponents when it finds errors in an application at the preliminary assessment stage without requiring the process to be reset entirely. It would enable the APVMA to grant only part of a variation application, instead of requiring the complete rejection of an entire application if parts of it require rejection. It would clarify the definition of 'expiry date' in the Agvet Code to mean the date after which a chemical product 'must not' be used, instead of 'should not', which is a much better indication of the safety for use of most of our agvet chemicals and of critical importance. And it makes a number of other minor technical reforms, which we have confidence will not in themselves compromise human or environmental safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens fundamentally support the concept of an efficient and effective pesticide and veterinary medicine regulator. It's in the interests of all parties, whether they be Australia's farmers, chemical companies, public health advocates and experts or environmentalists, that our chemical regulator works well. But it's interesting that, on the one hand, the government is making these minor reforms while, on the other hand, the APVMA is in crisis. It's a crisis of capacity and a crisis of public confidence. The adequacy of these reforms must be compared and must be shown in a harsh light compared to the scale of the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the APVMA has lost capacity is uncontroversial at this point—everybody knows it's the case. The decline in approval time lines, the loss of scientists and other staff, the need at the last budget to inject a large amount of money into the agency to prop up the relocation to Armidale—these are all signs of an agency that has become a political plaything for the Nationals' decentralisation agenda. Then there's the fact that the APVMA, after being so certain that they were going to shift all of their operations to Armidale, decided no, actually they were going to have to keep operations in Canberra as well. It shows that the whole management of the APVMA under this government has been a complete shambles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The smoking gun in the shambles we've got at the APVMA at the moment is that in the other place this week is the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2018. We'll have a lot more to say about this bill when it comes through to the Senate, but it is really just astounding that this government is considering the privatisation of our chemical assessment process. What could be a bigger admission of failure—an admission that they have lost control of their workflow, that they can't cope, that they haven't got the capacity to deal with the amount of work that's required—than accrediting third-party bodies to assess the public health and environmental safety of our agvet chemicals? And it's astounding that they're doing it in the current environment; that they're not seeing the risks in allowing proponents to choose their own assessor. What kind of culture does this create? Has this government learned nothing from the banking royal commission, from the vocational education disaster, from the piles of examples of poorly regulated or unregulated conflicts of interest that are allowed to grow when the government decides to leave things entirely to the private sector? I hope that Labor and the crossbench will join the Greens in ruling out such a dangerous proposition when the bill comes to the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more dangerous, though, than the collapse of the capacity of the APVMA is the collapse in public confidence. In our Senate inquiry into the performance of the independence of the APVMA we heard witness after witness tell us that there was little to no faith that the APVMA was operating in the interests of the broader community. Its approach to glyphosate was a case in point. Despite multiple senior executives at the APVMA admitting that the finding by IARC, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic was correct, there was no formal reconsideration, no robust review, which is astounding. The situation with glyphosate is appalling. Here you've got a chemical that's probably carcinogenic, but there's been no formal review by the APVMA. It really seems to be the case once again that the APVMA is singing to the tune of the big agricultural chemical industry rather than doing the thorough and independent investigation and regulation that is required for the safety of our farmers and our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are chemicals that have been on the books since the APVMA came into place in the early 1990s and that haven't been assessed for over 25 years. Some of them have been banned in many overseas constituencies, such as the European Union. There was legislation in 2013 that the Greens were very supportive of. It would have ensured we re-evaluated and reviewed this cohort of chemicals and we'd have a robust and straightforward way of keeping our chemical regulations up to date with the most recent science. But—guess what?—when this government came into power in 2013 it decided to scrap that legislation, and, appallingly, the Labor Party supported them in doing that. Labor and the coalition came together to tear up that process of reassessment—of looking again and re-evaluating this cohort of chemicals that haven't been assessed for over 25 years. They tore up that process before it even began.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then you've got the money swirling around our politics. Corporate donation laws and election funding rules are absolutely broken. We recently saw the AEC returns for the 2017-18 financial year. The agvet chemical industry and its lobbying bodies gave over $130,000 to the major parties in that year alone. Bayer, the company that holds the patent for glyphosate and that is desperate, of course, for glyphosate not to be independently re-evaluated, contributed over $80,000, split almost evenly between Labor and the coalition. Is it any wonder that trust in our agencies, our departments and, most importantly, our ministers and parliament is eroding? The rot goes very deep.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we got in response to this? The government has circulated amendments that would create a new board structure for the APVMA, with the idea that this would magically improve its governance, would magically make APVMA a trustworthy institution that everybody could have trust in. But the details are light, the costs are unclear and the government is actually yet to make a case as to why a board would be better than the current situation. We've got a lot of sympathy for improving the governance of the APVMA—don't worry about that. In general, the idea of having an independent board that would have independent oversight is something we'd support, but it needs much more than that, and it needs much more detail than what we are being given in this amendment. One of the recommendations from our inquiry was that there needed to be much more robust community involvement and representation and engagement with the decision-making, but that is not being considered. We've got the possibility that the board may set up some subcommittees but no certainty, no mandatory community engagement, in the processes of the APVMA. Yet the community are huge stakeholders: it's our safety. It's the safety of the people who are using these chemicals and the people who are affected by these chemicals as they are being used in our environment. The Greens know that a board by itself is not going to be enough to restore both competence to the APVMA and confidence in it. Given that the addition of a board isn't necessary for the passage of this bill, we agree that the government should not proceed with including it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we're going to change the governance of the APVMA—and I repeat, it's something that the Greens absolutely and fundamentally support—we must not make the mistakes of the past and do it in a piecemeal fashion. There is a lot more work that needs to be done. We need to re-look at the structure of the APVMA and make sure that it's a body that can really have the support and the confidence of the community. Let's do that reform comprehensively and do it at once with really good consultation with the community and the industry and with broad agreement about the path forward. But we need to do it separately to the, frankly, very minor reforms that are contained in the original bill before this place today.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  I, too, stand to make a contribution on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill 2017—and I note the '2017'. In fact, it was actually 25 October 2017 when this particular bill was first introduced into the other place. The bill was introduced for some pretty sound reasons. The APVMA is the body, or the regulator, which is absolutely essential to the quality of life of Australians, because we need chemicals to protect our crops from pests and diseases and we need them to protect our animals from pests and diseases. It actually underlines and underpins the competitiveness and the productivity of Australia's farmers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, agvet has a huge range of other uses as well. It controls pests and vermin in food premises and it kills flies and mosquitos around your house. We use it to preserve timber, control the fouling of boat hulls and keep our swimming pools safe. We also use these chemicals to keep our pets safe and make sure that they're in a healthy environment. Agvet protects our environment from invasive pests and weeds. So the regulation and the safe and effective control of our agvet chemicals is absolutely in the interests of every single Australian. Don't be fooled that this is just about one sector of our economy; agvet touches just about every person in some way, shape or form. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The role of the APVMA is absolutely fundamental to that outcome. The APVMA is there to ensure that these chemicals, as they come into our country and are used, are safe for people, plants, animals and our environment. The legislation that we have before us today, that has been a matter of debate now for some 18 months, amends the agvet chemicals legislation so that we can end up with greater streamlining and better reporting and operational efficiencies within the APVMA. It also deals with—as is always the case with legislation that has been around for a while—the ambiguities, redundancies and unnecessary provisions that exist in legislation as it changes over time. In particular, it seeks to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden on industry by simplifying reporting on these products, and it seeks to make sure that we are always on top of the kind of information that the industry needs to provide to the regulator and that that information is always timely and up to date. Then we can have maximum efficiency and effectiveness in the regulation of this industry, but, at the same time, not place unnecessary time and resource burdens onto industry, so that we don't slow down the productivity of industry and also make sure that we have timely accessibility to the effective chemicals that we need in our everyday lives to keep ourselves, our environment and our pets and animals safe. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government's $4 billion 2015 <span style="font-style:italic;">Agricultural competitiveness white paper</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>was an absolute blueprint for taking Australia's agricultural sector from where it was a number of years ago to the powerhouse that it is today. We've seen massive increases in the efficiency, effectiveness, profitability and productivity of our agricultural sector on the back of a number of initiatives that were put forward as part of that competitiveness white paper. Not the least of those initiatives was the increased level of access that we made available to our agricultural sector through the negotiation of a number of free trade agreements. This has seen huge competitive tension return to the Australian marketplace, so we're seeing better prices for our farmers, better prices at the farm gate and more of our products able to be exported overseas. This allows the agricultural sector to play the extraordinarily important role that it does in Australia's balance of payments figures. In fact, in the 12 months to the end of June 2018, agriculture was the sector that was the single largest contributor to our export profitability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as part of this process, following the announcement in the agricultural competitiveness white paper that the government was going to commit $17.1 million to measures to make sure that we improve access and efficiency to agvet chemicals whilst retaining the necessary safety provisions for humans, animals, plants and the environment, we committed to undertake a very extensive consultation process. During 2015 and 2016, we undertook widespread consultation, and stakeholder feedback indicated that there was widespread interest in reform and support for a more efficient and effective regulator. Arising from this consultation, the government then prepared this particular bill, which is the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill, and a second bill, which was referred to earlier in somebody's contribution, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2018, which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 18 October 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in this bill seek to establish an APVMA board and, as part of that, to reduce the annual reporting burden on industry and to provide for civil penalties if false or misleading information is provided to the APVMA. Currently it's only a criminal offence and administrative actions are available. The measures also seek to make minor changes to improve the operation of agvet chemical legislation. So this bill, if we're putting it into simple terms and in relation to the benefit that it will actually give to the industry—and it's absolutely essential that the industry gets access to these particular chemicals—first and foremost will reduce the regulatory burden by simplifying reporting requirements for annual returns. It will enable applicants to address minor errors or missing information identified during the assessment process of an application instead of the application just being automatically refused and the applicant having to pay more money in application fees and spending more time on a whole new application. It's just common sense. It also will enable part of a variation in the application process to be granted. Instead of having it refused and the applicant having to pay more application fees, it will actually enable that variation to occur during the application process. And it will improve the APVMA's governance by establishing a governance board to support a more efficient and effective regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I noted in the contribution that Senator Brown made before that she was particularly critical of the establishment of the board for the APVMA. First of all, it needs to be put on the public record that the board will be the accountable authority. Under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, it must, and will, ensure the proper, efficient and effective performance of the APVMA's functions. It will be tasked with determining the policies, objectives and strategies that must be followed by the APVMA, and the board will help set the APVMA's strategic direction, drive operational performance and set up an appropriate risk framework that will ensure greater accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During Senator Brown's contribution, she made it sound like this was some anomaly within the system, that this board was being set up in some way that was completely counter to the way we operate within the public sector when it comes to how we manage, control or operate our regulators, of which we have many. First of all, we as a government reviewed over 70 corporate and non-corporate Commonwealth entities in deciding what the most appropriate structure for the board of the APVMA should be. It was done in a way that met with all of the guidelines, including the Australian Government Charging Framework, such that any of the cost-recovery arrangements were entirely consistent with that framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Off the top of my head, I can only think of a couple of regulators that would fit in a similar mould to this particular regulator. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority operates with a board under a cost recovery mechanism. Airservices Australia also operates with a board and is also a regulator with a cost recovery model. So, just off the top of my head, there are a couple that I can think of, but I'm sure, given that we reviewed more than 70 Commonwealth entities in the process of making the decision about what the most appropriate structure for this particular board was, there are many, many more that will be able to fit into a similar structure as the one that's being proposed by this bill here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other comment that I would make in relation to this is that Senator Rice also made comments about this particular board. Without being overly critical of the contribution that was made by Senator Rice, there seems to be a lack of consistency here in the debate. You can't just conveniently say that you want more regulation—I can assure you that the only thing I ever hear from the other end of the chamber, from the Greens, is that they want more regulation—but then say, when we are providing another level of protection, of assurance, of accountability, of transparency and of governance within a structure that is so tremendously important to the entire Australian community, that you think it's a bad idea that we put that corporate board in place, just as Senator Rice did. You need to be consistent; you can't be convenient in your response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suppose the other part of it is that there obviously seems to be an allergic reaction from the other end of the chamber whenever we talk about deregulation or privatisation, as if there is some sort of perfect solution that everything should happen in Canberra and that nothing should happen in regional Australia at all. Everything needs to be controlled from Canberra—central control, central command—and it's almost like it is a crime for us to consider that privatisation is a mechanism that's available to government for the efficient and effective operation of many of the activities that government sees as very important to Australia. I mean, we retain the regulatory control over it through legislative and regulatory instruments. The word 'privatisation' is not a swear word. I think we just need to put aside some of these entrenched negativities towards some of the things that the conservative side of politics believe are a valuable way of preserving taxpayers' money, making sure we get things done efficiently and effectively, and doesn't turn government into the great behemoth bureaucracy that some others would like it to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is that we need to be really careful when we're debating these particular types of legislation. When we are talking about chemicals that, if handled incorrectly, can be tremendously dangerous to human health, to animal health and to our environment, we don't want to actually start rabbits running on conspiracy theories. Once again we've heard some conspiracy theories being thrown around in the debate about this particular piece of legislation, and I think it's very important that we warn against that sort of behaviour. The effective operation of our agvet sector, the role that the APVMA must continue to play, is absolutely essential in the confidence that the Australian public can have and the message that we send to the rest of the world about how good we are at how we regulate in an efficient, an effective and a streamlined way the things that we take so terribly seriously in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nobody could doubt that when we came into government in 2013 the performance of the APVMA was something that we considered to be a significant issue to government. We'd heard from industry across the board that the performance of the APVMA was something that was held as a significant inhibitor to the development of our agricultural sector. It was considered to be extremely important that we dealt with a number of the issues that were before us, and that's exactly what this bill seeks to do. The fact that we've been standing here now for 18 months talking about this bill is a sad indictment that we are happy to play politics with something as important as this, instead of actually just getting the bill put through the parliament and getting the benefits that are able to accrue from these changes on the ground so that we can get on with the job that is before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But back to the board and why we believe this board will add great value and benefit to the industry. We've heard from Senator Brown that CropLife don't particularly want the board. One of the things that you will be pleased to see demonstrated is that the application, introduction and establishment of this board under the conditions and the structure that we're proposing here will actually end up providing net benefit to industry, because the purpose of the board is to make the APVMA more effective and efficient. That necessarily translates out quite directly. It will mean the costs to the APVMA will be reduced, and the beneficiary of reduced costs of application, reduced costs for the registration of chemicals and streamlining of the regulation of chemicals will be the industry sector. The fact that we are changing the processes to make them easier, more effective, less cumbersome, not so burdensome—all of these things—will add up to making the cost of regulation and registration of chemicals cheaper, and the beneficiary of cheaper regulation and registration will be the industry sector. So we believe that the establishment of a skills based, experience based board will assist the APVMA in implementing its new business model. It is a business model that we are absolutely determined will be the most efficient and effective regulator based in regional Australia—there we go, regionalisation—that will be able to deliver maximum efficiency and benefit to our industry sectors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also worked closely with industry in developing the model for this board. The board, as it is proposed in this legislation, is also consistent with the findings of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Water Resources inquiry into the APVMA regulatory reforms, which supports the government's plan to establish an APVMA board. This is but one area where we believe that we can make a substantial difference to the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of the APVMA and, in doing so, provide broad benefits across our whole community for people who require access to the regulatory activities of the APVMA. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth noting that we are investing significant money in information and communications technology within APVMA to make sure that it has the ICT capacity to be able to respond quickly and effectively as an authority and as a regulator. It's tremendously important in this day and age that we are able to collect, collate, evaluate, use and implement the massive amount of information that is delivered to bodies such as this regulator to make sure that we are getting the best possible outcome. As we rightly know, there is much change in this area: new chemicals come onto the market, more information becomes available about old chemicals, or they become obsolete because chemical companies are no longer manufacturing them. This is a very dynamic environment in which the APVMA is required to operate. The consequences of us not having an effective and efficient organisation which is able to respond quickly to changes in the marketplace can have massive detrimental impacts, particularly on our agricultural sector. So the investment of over $10 million to modernise the APVMA's ICT systems will deliver huge benefits to the regulatory services available to the Australian industry sectors that rely on these services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the election, I have to say that, under Labor, the proportion of applications finalised on time was but 33 per cent. I pointed to that because it does demonstrate that there was definitely a need for us to undertake the kind of reforms that are proposed in this bill. We have done it in a systematic and strategic way. We've undertaken wide consultation. We have listened to the interests and the concerns of the people who are impacted and the various stakeholders in this industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very pleasing to say that as of November 2018, the latest performance statistics of the APVMA show that it has significantly improved. There is obviously still room for further improvement, but it has significantly improved its performance for the fifth consecutive quarter, with 86 per cent of applications finalised within the legislative frameworks. So I would ask the chamber today to put politics aside, because this is a very, very important piece of legislation that affects every one of us and our everyday lives. I think support for this bill is absolutely essential for all of us.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill 2017. I support initiatives to reduce the regulatory burden for our primary producers, providing they're taking into account the primary purpose of the APVMA, which, as we know, is to protect the health and safety of people, animals and the environment by ensuring chemical products are safe. So, yes, this is a very important regulator. It has very important functions. That's all the more reason why the government of the day should be respectful of its operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll talk later in my contribution about the way in which this government has been utterly dismissive of the importance of this authority. Labor is supporting this bill, but I note that this legislation should have been implemented three years ago. The coalition government has dragged its feet on agriculture reform just like it's dragged its feet on banking reform, on payday lending, on consumer protections and in relation to superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill seeks to do is to make minor and technical amendments to the following acts: the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994. The explanatory memorandum states that the amendments will 'realise operational efficiencies, reduce unnecessary regulation, clarify ambiguities and remove redundant provisions'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In enacting these changes, the bill reduces the regulatory burden on industry by simplifying reporting requirements for annual returns; reduces the administrative burden on the APVMA and industry by increasing the flexibility of the APVMA to manage errors in an application at the preliminary assessment stage; reduces the regulatory burden by enabling the APVMA to grant part of a variation application under section 27 of the schedule to the code act, which is the Agvet Code; enables a person to apply to vary the relevant particulars or conditions of a label approval that is suspended, to the extent that the variation relates to the grounds for suspension; establishes civil pecuniary penalties for contraventions of provisions relating to providing false or misleading information in the Agvet Code and the administration act; amends the notification requirements in section 8E of the Agvet Code so that the APVMA and the FSANZ will have the flexibility to agree on appropriate time frames for notifications; amends the definition of 'expiry date' in the Agvet Code to mean 'the date after which a chemical product must not be used'; and makes minor and technical amendments to the administration act and the Agvet Code, including the repeal of redundant provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my opening comments, the government has been too slow to implement the necessary reforms in this space—reforms which were expected from industry stakeholders following the introduction of these significant legislative reforms by the Labor government in 2013 to improve the efficiency of the APVMA. Despite the National Party selling themselves as the champions of farmers, it's often Labor who achieves the results. Labor's reforms saw promising signs of increased performance at the APVMA emerge in 2016. The performance against the statutory time frame for assessing pesticide applications reached 83 per cent in the 2016 September quarter. However, with the ongoing negative impact on the APVMA due to the forced relocation by the then Turnbull government, as currently supported by the Morrison government, these promising signs have been devastated. I noted Senator Ruston's comments earlier about the importance of the work of the APVMA not only for Australians but also in terms of our international reputation, and that just throws into stark relief the irresponsibility in relation to the relocation of the APVMA. The APVMA only achieved 30 per cent of its work within statutory time frames for crop protection in the 2017 March quarter, 24 per cent in the June quarter and 36 per cent in the September quarter. The recent performance figures have improved but are still not at the height of the time frames reached in the 2016 September quarter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that industry stakeholders are seeking to have this bill passed as soon as possible, but I note that this bill could have been put forward much earlier than 25 October 2017. It's interesting that Senator Ruston made the comment that these reforms are extremely urgent. You wouldn't know it by the time frames that they've been following in respect of these reforms. Further, since the election of the coalition government, it's failed to identify or deliver any legislative reform options that would result in any quantifiable ongoing efficiency dividend for the regulator. The former Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Mr Joyce, has been all talk and no action on ensuring that further legislative operational efficacies are implemented. An example of the all talk and no action is the failed 2015 agriculture white paper, which indicated that the government would further streamline the approval of agricultural and veterinary chemicals by reducing industry and user costs by around $68 million to improve timely access to productivity-enhancing chemicals while still ensuring appropriate safeguards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, we see that this is proof of a government that's big on media releases and discussion papers and incredibly slow to act. It brings to mind the continuous policy failures of the National Party in relation to the constituency which they claim to represent. We've seen failures on the part of the National Party in respect of climate policy, in respect of the rollout of the NBN, particularly for rural areas, when it comes to irrigation policy, when it comes to the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility and northern Australia development, and when it comes to rural health. We know that people in rural Australia suffer some of the worst outcomes when it comes to health and yet we see this government not lifting a finger to assist. Another recent policy failure has been in respect of the creation of the Regional Investment Corporation, a $28 million organisation for which there is no policy rationale. In fact, it duplicates many of the functions of the state rural adjustment authorities. It's going to be located in Orange—which is a state seat that the National Party lost, coincidently. We know from evidence received at the last estimates that it's currently administering around four loans. This is a massive waste of taxpayer funding and another example of the failure of the National Party to properly represent people in rural Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to this bill, it does consist of the necessary minor technical amendments to assist with streamlining the APVMA operations. Such amendments are to be expected following the significant legislative reforms introduced by Labor in 2013 to improve the efficiency of the APVMA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments presented in the bill by the current government are three years later than what was required. Taking three years to implement necessary amendments is unacceptable, and this unnecessary delay highlights the lack of urgency and the focus of the then Deputy Prime Minister and his previous department, which had been distracted by the forced relocation to the member for New England's own electorate. However, criticism of the department is not warranted, because they have had to manage a difficult minister with very different priorities. Since deciding to relocate the regulator to Armidale, in his own electorate, the former agriculture minister and Deputy Prime Minister has failed to identify or deliver any legislative reform options that would result in any quantifiable, ongoing efficiency dividend for the regulator. Agricultural chemicals are a cost effective, efficient, essential and sustainable option for farmers to use to control pests, weeds and diseases and, as such, represent a core input for modern farming systems. A streamlined, effective regulator capable of delivering more timely risk assessments, approvals and registrations is essential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we go back to the beginning, to when the then Deputy Prime Minister announced his forced relocation of the APVMA to his own electorate, he did so without any understanding of what the impact would be on the authority. Or, if he did understand it, it was with callous disregard for the impact. It also appears, on the face of it, that he seemed not to understand what the APVMA actually does. On 10 February, 2016, Minister Joyce actually said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Moving the APVMA would allow it to have a closer interaction with the people who actually use agricultural and veterinary chemicals, as well as build a centre of excellence in the research of agricultural issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The APVMA does not actually deal directly with farmers and it does not test the products. The talk of the centre of excellence was just hollow words, and there is no actual plan as to what an agricultural centre of excellence would actually look like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Joyce said that the proposal to relocate the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority to Armidale would go through the process of an independent cost-benefit risk analysis, which would then be looked at further by the government. A cost-benefit was undertaken, and it gave a damning assessment of the relocation, stating that, firstly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The estimated economic cost of $23.19 million excludes any potential cost to industry arising from the risks to the agricultural sector, the chemical industry or Australia’s trading reputation. Whilst these risks are real, their impacts and consequences are based on a probability of an event occurring and as such in adopting the principle of conservatism they have been excluded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, it said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To effectively undertake the move of the APVMA and adopt relevant risk mitigation strategies, the cash cost to the government could be significantly higher than the estimated economic cost of $23.19 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report continued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The most significant risk identified through the analysis relates to the ability of the APVMA to relocate, or to recruit and replace, key APVMA executive, management and technical assessment staff within the first two years of relocation. Critically, the loss of technical assessment staff (regulatory scientists) has the potential to seriously disrupt the ability of the APVMA to successfully fulfill its purpose and achieve its objectives in the short and medium term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, a key concern for stakeholders in relation to the relocation of the APVMA to Armidale is the impact that the relocation may have on the approval of new chemicals for use. Stakeholders are concerned that delays to the approval of new chemicals will arise as a result of the loss of staff, the disruption to business and/or the impact to the APVMA’s current reform agenda. The analysis found that if poorly executed, the economic costs of moving the APVMA could therefore be considerably higher than identified in the cost benefit analysis. Based on conservative estimates of a one year delay in the approval of new products, the potential impact on the agriculture sector for crops alone could be between $64 million and $193 million per annum. The risks to the agvet chemical industry associated with moving the APVMA are also significant with a one year delay in the approval of new chemicals potentially impacting industry to the value of between $0.8 million and $2.7 million per annum in terms of lost revenues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the cost benefit was totally ignored by the then Deputy Prime Minister, and now the risks identified are actual realities. But it wasn't only the cost benefit analysis that warned the then Deputy Prime Minister of his ill-considered pork barrel, the former CEO Kareena Arthy stressed the negative impact the relocation would have on the authority, in a letter to Minister Joyce on 31 July 2015, stating: 'Potential loss of regulatory scientists—the most significant challenge highlighted by the outcomes of the staff survey is that around three-quarters of regulatory scientists would probably not move if the APVMA is relocated. Only seven regulatory scientists have indicated a willingness to move. Even if all the scientists who have indicated that they may consider moving agree to move, there would be only 19 regulatory scientists with knowledge of how to assess registration applications or undertake the underlying scientific assessments.' The letter from Ms Arthy goes on to talk about the fact that regulatory scientists have highly specialises skills that are in short supply in Australia and even under the current situation, back in 2015, the APVMA found it hard to recruit appropriate regulatory scientists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this is now a reality. The APVMA has recently indicated in its business model:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The construction of the new business models for Armidale should be regarded as a high priority and delivered by a full-time team headed by a senior executive with a direct reporting line to the CEO. In order to insulate the team from the day-to-day and operational pressures of a busy regulator, the team should be separated from the ongoing business and include staff located in Armidale. Arrangements could also be made to facilitate the transfer of staff who wish to relocate to Armidale into this team so they have opportunities to contribute to the construction of the new model and the training of new staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The maintenance of a sufficient internal scientific capability will require vigorous efforts to retain and recruit appropriately skilled regulatory scientists. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will require active management of staff relocations including incentives for staff to relocate and an accelerated recruitment program. The APVMA should also consider targeting staff from overseas pesticide and veterinary chemical regulators, either on permanent appointment or on secondment. Remote working may provide a means of retaining some more experienced staff. However, only some of the functions currently performed are suitable for remote working, and it is highly unlikely that this would be a long-term viable arrangement for the bulk of the staff involved in the function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the APVMA is, of course, consumed with the issues associated with this forced relocation. I also note that there's been a recent report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee this month in relation to the independence of regulatory decisions made by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. This committee report has expressed the concern 'about the manner in which the APVMA was relocated', 'its impact on the availability of staff expertise', 'the flow-on effects for farmers across Australia who require timely and certain access to pesticides and veterinary medicines', and the committee pointed to the fact that despite the best efforts of the authority they 'had no other option than to retain the satellite office in Canberra'. This is an indictment of the whole move.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Labor will support this bill today. We will support it because, while those opposite drag their feet in standing up for the rural and regional communities they purport to represent, Labor will stand up. Labor is listening and delivering for regional and rural communities through Senate inquiries into the dairy industry, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund and insurance policy prices; through investment in renewable energy; through a review of free trade agreement protocols to expedite opportunities for our produce growers; and, in Queensland, through state Labor initiatives such as Building our Regions and wild dog cluster fencing. Labor will continue to listen to regional and rural communities. (<span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span>)</span>

                    <a href="e68" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  I just want to say one thing before I make my contribution to the debate on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Operational Efficiency) Bill 2017. That was a magnificent speech from Senator Ketter. I tilt my hat to you, Senator Ketter, because you have said everything that needs to be said. This bill does have Labor's support. We've supported it all the way. It came to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, which I chair ably backed up by Senator O'Sullivan, Senator McCarthy, Senator Chisholm and Senator Brockman.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some things in this building are unbelievable. It's like <span style="font-style:italic;">Groundhog Day</span>. You get that horrible feeling, 'Here we go again!' Hollywood couldn't even make this rubbish up. The light has to be shone on this shemozzle that has been the forced relocation of the APVMA. Before senators opposite get all excited—you might have the odd senator who makes things up; not you, Senator Colbeck—I'll make this very, very clear. Labor has absolutely no opposition to relocating government agencies to the regions. Why not, if there's a perfect fit? It creates employment, it creates opportunity. Absolutely. I know that's been done with fisheries, and we don't hear a boo out of the RDFC and not a drama from us. But this one here is one of the worst examples of stupidity from a minister who is so far out of his depth that he can't even hide his pork barrelling efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm referring to former Senator Joyce, Mr Joyce, when he was the Minister for Agriculture. I have said to Mr Joyce on a number of occasions that there are a lot of good things he could be doing—not that he is—but this is one of the dumbest ones. The APVMA's work ethic is unquestionable. It's not doubted. It does a magnificent job. We've always said that. We've always supported the APVMA for the role that it plays. The APVMA consists of nearly 200 employees all up, I think. I'm just trying to remember. There's been that much going on lately. Of that, there are some 60-odd—I think it was 65; that's the number that comes to my head—scientists that work for the APVMA. Senator Ketter mentioned that under Ms Arthy's time in leadership a survey was put out through the APVMA asking who would be prepared to leave Canberra and relocate to Armidale. I've never been to Armidale. From what I've heard, it's a magnificent, wonderful, friendly place—and that's great. But you can understand that, for whatever reason, a lot of people do not like to be uprooted, let alone go from state to state or out to the regions. That is their business, whether it's that they have kids in school, elderly parents they want to look after, family, friends or everything in a certain area. They were employed in that area and that's why they went there. So for the minister to pork-barrel the movement of the APVMA was, as Senator Ketter said quite rightfully, a 'forced relocation'. I think there were about seven scientists who said, 'I will move,' or, 'I will think about moving.' As to the good folk of Armidale, I don't know if there are another 60-odd scientists waiting in Armidale to be employed. I have no idea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to keep shining the light on the stupidity of this, because it's been a series of cluster muck-ups which we have argued about in Senate estimates. I'm sure there are other senators here who sit in rural, regional affairs and transport estimates with me. We have been asking questions about and debating this topic of the forced relocation of the APVMA to Armidale for three years, I suppose. It's not a secret that we have estimates three times a year. So there have been at least nine occasions in Senate estimates where we have been trying to work out how the heck the APVMA can function as it's meant to function when it's 50-odd scientists short.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rain, hail or snow, the APVMA was going to Armidale because it was Mr Joyce's pet project. It got to the stage, which Senator Ketter also mentioned, where everyone realised it was just not sustainable. So they put the building up for sale and moved everyone out. What's the next thing they did? They found, I believe, that some of the staff from APVMA in Armidale at the time were working out of McDonald's. You might say, 'Well, that's pretty normal for government departments,' but I haven't heard of it. But, anyway, they were relocated to McDonald's in Armidale for a little while. I'm not blaming the department. They've got this bucket of mess they're trying to sort out. Then they find out: 'Now we are going to have a satellite office left in Canberra, so why the hell did we move? What was that all about?' I will tell you what it's all about. The APVMA, in the best interests of serving their master—I think their master should be the farmers who rely on them, but anyway—desperately tried to defend it and tried to paint it up, putting hundreds and thousands on this certain sandwich. But the truth of the matter is that the jobs have not been filled. So, if anyone knows where we can find 58 or 60 scientists around Australia, can you put out a sign saying, 'Dear so and so, ring this number.' I say this clearly: I cannot see how the heck this is going to operate. I have no idea. The answers have not been coming back. I understand the department are desperately trying, like I said, to protect their minister's stupid decision. It is absolutely ridiculous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's dig a bit deeper. I could go on all day. I will again try to get answers in Senate estimates. There's been cloudiness around this decision. One thing I want to bring to the Senate's attention—and it has everything to do with the bill—is that, when the government put out its Senate amendments, it clearly said in the sheet that the government amendments 'will have no financial impact on the Australian government budget'. To me 'no impact' means not one single cent shall be spent on it. They go on to say that the costs to establish and maintain the board will be met through the APVMA's cost recovery arrangements. At the last Senate estimates—was it the last Senate estimates or the time before?—we tried to drill down to get some answers out of the mob and found out that that's not the case. They clearly said that the government will have to fund the first year to run this board—sorry, I should have said this governance board that they've invented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sorry, I'll take a step back. Here we are: non-contro, all in agreement to do the best we can and assist our farming communities, who rely on the APVMA. And then, all of a sudden, after we've finished the inquiry, up came the government with the brainwave that they're going to introduce a board of governance—sorry; I should have said that earlier in the piece—to which the Labor senators are quite clearly asking, 'Why do we need a board of governance?' There are a lot of questions around that that we'll be asking later through Senate estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If something's operating extraordinarily well under the circumstances—and I listened to Senator Ruston's contribution, when she went out of her way to make sure that we on this side and everyone else listening knew that the number of approvals by the APVMA has significantly improved. They're doing a great job. She actually mentioned five of the last quarters and how it's improving all the time. Don't forget that there's a satellite office down here in Canberra where most of them are working out of. So, if it's improving significantly, why the heck do we have to have a board of governance when we've never had a board of governance at the APVMA? To me—and I'm not standing on the outside looking in but sitting on the committee that handles all this stuff—no-one's ever criticised the APVMA's ability to do its work and do its job properly. That says to me that obviously the brainiacs in the government—and I'm using that term really loosely. In fact, I shouldn't even mislead the Senate by using the word brainiac about Mr Joyce and that mob over there. Tell us, Mr Joyce or Mr Littleproud or someone else, for crying out loud: if they're doing so well and are markedly improving, why do they need a board of governance?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I'll come back to this: I want to know who's on it, when it's going to meet and what it's going to do. When someone doesn't need a board of governance but someone else wants to give them a board of governance, it just sounds to me like another red wine club. Is this just another job for the boys? Are there are couple of mates—I don't know. I've got no proof. No-one answers the questions. But it sounds to me like someone's being lined up for a cushy little job and might get paid a few bob to go to Armidale twice a year and have a meeting to talk about I don't know what. This is where the $600,000 charge comes in. At the last round of Senate estimates the officials clearly said that the APVMA will not be funding it. The federal government will be funding the first year of operation to the tune of $600,000. I've never been on a board, so I don't know how much it costs to fly board members to Armidale—board members who we don't even know. I don't know the price of accommodation in Armidale, but I wouldn't think it's as outrageous as Sydney. What the hell is the $600,000 for? Can someone tell me? I bet they can't. I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr Deputy Acting President Brockman. I'll bet you a $5 scratchie that we don't get the answers. I know you sit there and think, 'Now, Senator Sterle, that's a bit unfair—</span>

                    </a>  I would never ever say that you know, Deputy Acting President, because you've been just as frustrated as me on the committee at times through Senate estimates. I'm dying to hear the answer. I'm really looking forward to it. What will $600,000 buy? What will be the job of the board of governance apart from going to Armidale—are they going to go to Armidale to meet? Is that what they're going to do? Or is the $600,000 to fly the relocated staff or leaders from APVMA—who we haven't found yet or we may have found—to the Gold Coast or something? I don't have a clue. I'm really looking forward to finding out what that is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It just keeps falling into place. I've been around this committee for 13½ years. We've had some magnificent inquiries. We've had some magnificent outcomes and some good policy. I'm blessed to be the chair of the reference committee and, previously, when in government, the legislation committee. I'm blessed to have dead-set, fair-dinkum senators, who park the political bulldust aside. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, on every inquiry the first thing we do is look at what is in the best interest of Australia's farming community, what is in the best interest of Australia's food producers and what is in the best interest of our nation, whether it be biosecurity, access to trade and markets or whatever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nearly all the senators that I have sat on that committee with—there's been the odd one who thinks they're going to reinvent the wheel—actually agree with me. Some of the members of the committee have gone off and become parliamentary secretaries, shadow ministers, ministers and all sorts of stuff. No-one could ever say that we will run a political argument and use agriculture as our football. We don't do that. We absolutely make sure that, when we come out and have the reports, the majority of the time they are agreed to by the committee. We all tick off. Whether it's under my chairmanship, Senator O'Sullivan's chairmanship or former Senator Bill Heffernan's chairmanship, we've always said, 'If there are some differences, how can we come to an arrangement where we can all agree,' because we just think it's in the best interests of the committee and the communities that we serve. And most of the time we do that. There are some times when there are things that we just cannot agree on, but what we do is we say, 'Let's have some additional comments.' For those who aren't quite sure, additional comments are: 'We agree with the basis of the report, but we want to add something in that we think is important, even though you might have a different view.' And we do that. Now and again we'll have a dissenting report, which is very rarely, but they do happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me back to the complexity of this shameless pork-barrelling by the minister. To make things even murkier, last year it came across our radar—I'm just trying to remember, because there's been a lot of excitement in the rural, regional affairs and transport committee—that the government was trying to find a site in Armidale. I'm happy to be corrected if my memory is a bit hazy, but I remember there was this site found and I realised that it wasn't quite big enough and that it needed to be a bit bigger. Then there was another site. They were both on different streets, but I think their back doors bumped into each other—something like that. In the middle was a little obstacle—I think it was a tavern. Was it a tavern? What was it? There was something in the middle, anyway—a building—and the government went out and said, 'We need a building'—</span>

                    </a>  Spontaneous! Senator Sinodinos, it's great to see you back, mate—thank you. Spontaneous combustion happened at this club. I wouldn't dare think that that was convenient—I would not even suggest that there's anything inappropriate there. I believe there was a coronial inquiry and they couldn't find enough evidence. I think they said that there was a homeless person who might have started the fire. Well, after questioning from Labor senators—and all the senators were listening around the room—all of a sudden, out of nowhere, the authorities have opened up the investigation again. Hollywood can't make this stuff up, you know? Everything about this forced relocation of the APVMA by the then Minister Joyce has got a stench about it. When all is said and done, if we cannot, what's the word, provide the staff—the man and woman power—and we can't find the 58 or whatever scientists short we are, which is not having a go at the rest of the people who have been told, 'You either move or you get a redundancy and go,' where's the logic in this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're supportive of the bill, we'll just continue asking about that relocation, but we're having real, serious dramas about why there has to be the governance board. And I come back to that, Mr Acting Deputy President Brockman, because you and I both know, as all senators here do, that, crikey, they're all over us like a cheap suit! They're checking out our travel—and so they should; it's taxpayers' dollars—and every senator in this place is aware of that, as are the members on the other side. Some have slip-ups, and thankfully they get caught and get a smack across the ear, and that's fine. But how does a government come out on a bipartisan inquiry and a bipartisan bill, then at the last minute whack in their governance board?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Someone could come to me and say: 'Do you know what? These are the reasons why, and put a compelling case,' and then say: 'We have to do it because we don't trust the APVMA'—and I'm not saying this; this is what could be—'they're not capable of doing their job properly, even though they're scientists and experts in their field. We just want to give a couple of mates a job.' Well, I've got no idea! So when we get into the committee stage, I'll be really interested to hear what's going on, bearing in mind that there are Senate estimates next week. We know how it all works: one thing that the department is very good at is getting back to us rapidly with questions taken on notice. They do; the agriculture department is very, very good, and I've said that many times. It's just a shame that there's a dark hole in the minister's office which they fall into and we can't find the answers for about three months. But, anyway, that's nothing new.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in saying that, in the best interests of our farming communities and our food producers Labor will always continue to act in their best interests. We consult widely. But we also have to understand here—and this is another one that gets up my nostrils—that the industry itself is not supportive of this governance board. So how can a government go out there and tell us a fib that it's not going to cost in any way? They've been ratted out; it is going to cost. And how can they say they've consulted, when industry itself has told us that it's not supportive of it? This is really like just saying: 'I'll have a brainwave; I'll go and pork barrel. I'll pretend that I'm consulting and I'll pretend that it's not going to cost us anything. I've got to do it'—for whatever reason I don't know; a club burns down in the middle of the night for some reason that we don't have an answer for but the police are looking into it—and we're supposed to sit here and just say: 'Look, help yourself! Just knock yourself out!'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one supports it, it costs and you didn't tell us the truth. What was the rush? On that: I know that at the end of the day we will support it. But I can guarantee one thing: I, myself, am not convinced for one second that this is a move that should be applauded. It should not be applauded. For want of repeating myself, if there are cases put forward where we can relocate—where we can put agencies out into the regions, boost the economy in the region and it's in the best interests of the food producers—then I give full support; not a problem. But this is a shambles created by a shambolic minister, and I don't think anyone can jump up to former Minister Joyce's defence and say: 'Geez, you got it wrong, Sterle! You got it wrong; you're mistaken! He's one of the most efficient ministers around and, crikey, he is one of the best things that ever happened to the agriculture industry and rural Australia.' I'm not: I just hope, for crying out loud, that we get the answers that we seek.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINODINOS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  Colleagues, it's good to be back. I love this place and the vocation we all share. We're here on the trust of our fellow Australians, who look to us to use our very privileged positions here to do our very best for the nation and for them. That lights the fire in my belly and I know it does for you, too. While that responsibility, inevitably, means a decent amount of robust, even fiery, contest among us, I've been reminded this week, indeed over the last 17 months, of our camaraderie outside the chamber, particularly when we go through tough times personally and professionally. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank so many of you for your warm welcome and best wishes on my return in recent days. A lot has happened in this place since I was blindsided by a cancer diagnosis in September 2017 and had to take immediate leave. Getting treated for stage 4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a late stage blood cancer, and then recovering, if you are lucky enough, as I am, is pretty much a full-time job in itself—not always fulfilling, but a necessary one nonetheless. Sitting on the sideline, out of the action, is not one of my strong points, but over time I came to let go of my frustrations and work out how I could keep on making a contribution when my health and hospital timetable permitted—keeping in touch with my constituents and party colleagues and keeping abreast of politics and parliamentary business. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think I can speak for the hundreds of thousands of Australians living with cancer and the tens of thousands of men and women who die each year from a range of cancers when I say that cancer really sucks: discovering that you've got it, accepting that you've got it, feeling sick, or, ironically, perhaps even worse—not feeling sick yet feeling totally bewildered; having your life, your family, your work upended; pushing through the multiple rounds of treatment, coping with the side effects of the treatment—not for broadcasting during general time, I can tell you, but I can go into chapter and verse on that; becoming more and more vulnerable as your immunity drains; and thinking about dying and death—your own death, and quite possibly soon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every cancer is different, and everybody's experience of it is so very different. No matter how much we think we can control things, our bodies have a will of their own, and that can play out in triumphant and tragic ways. You just can't pick it sometimes. But for all of us who get cancer, its treatment is an extreme form of physical, mental and emotional boot camp, except that, at the end of it, if you haven't died, you don't charge out of the blocks rippling and indestructible; instead, you stumble out into the light, depleted on every front. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After treatment ends, you can spend another year or more regaining your strength and nutrition and some of your old equilibrium while being closely monitored by your doctors and other healthcare professionals. It's only then that you begin what's called the 'survivorship' phase—re-entry, where you transition from being a cancer patient to someone with a history of cancer. Then you get through the first five years, then you get into your second five years, and then beyond. Meanwhile, like everyone else, you're always at the mercy of life's usual vicissitudes. For me, I'm grateful, relieved, and, frankly, overjoyed to be able to say that I'm in survivorship. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very fortunate to have had the care and support of my wife, Elizabeth, our children, family, dear friends, staff and colleagues. Some of them are here today, and they know the journey that we've all been on together. I couldn't have got through it without them, and I certainly could not have got through it without those wonderful doctors and their teams at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney—a world-class professional health facility, a public health facility. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make an important point. We have among the highest survival rates for cancer in the world. It's because our public and private health systems are resourced and blessed with top people like those at St Vincent's, and it's because of the vast advances that have been made in diagnostic methods, early detection and treatment. Even so, cancer is a huge challenge before us, for individual sufferers and their families and for the broader health and prosperity of this great country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cancer diagnoses are on the rise, and too many Australians are dying from cancer every year, especially as our population is ageing. What is really telling, though, is that today there are over a million Australians alive who have been diagnosed with cancer in the last 32 years. I've said over and over again to myself in the last year and more, 'Cancer is a word, not a sentence'. If you survive it, you get the gift of life again, but it's a new life. Few, if any of us, can go through such an experience and come out the other side not having to adapt to some fundamental, long-term changes in physical being, emotional self and mental outlook. So, for me, cancer survivorship is not a sentence: it is another chance at life, provided survivors can get the quality of care they received during their acute diagnosis and treatment phases. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a different sort of care. It needs multidisciplinary approaches and consistent primary care. It must give proper attention to the range of issues survivors face: everything from ongoing pain, fatigue, anxiety and depression to cancer recurrence, relationship problems, financial hardship and much more. With a population living years and decades beyond their cancer diagnosis and getting older, this presents a unique challenge for our governments and policymakers, our clinicians, our researchers and our healthcare system to ensure good survivorship, so that these are saved lives well lived. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is doing some terrific work on this. However, we can do more and I want to play my part in the years ahead in these efforts. In my many months on the sidelines, and still now, I try to make sense of my own cancer journey—of the cancer journey. I've concluded that a lot of things in life are just random, cancer among them. Good stuff happens, bad stuff happens. Leigh Sales has written about this very idea in her superb book <span style="font-style:italic;">Any Ordinary</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Day</span>. I think what matters is the journey. With cancer, it's the transformation it compels in every layer of us. I still can't quite get my mind around the fact that I no longer have the bone marrow I was born with. Instead, the vital storehouse that produces my red blood cells and has given me a whole new blood type is the gift of a young German man who I may never know but I owe my life to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my time as Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, most of the important policy work I did with my ministerial colleagues—Michaelia is here today—and with staff, the department and stakeholders was about helping people and businesses to manage transition and transformation, helping them adapt and embrace the huge changes occurring here in Australia and around the world due to the arrival of the fourth industrial revolution, smart manufacturing—smart everything—and the rapid growth of the digital economy. I wasn't to know that, before long, I would get my own dose of what transformation feels like. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last speech I gave as minister was at the AFR Innovation Summit in Sydney on 19 September 2017. I seem to remember I got a caning by the media for talking straight about innovation, but that's a story for another day. We've all been through that. A woman in the audience, towards the end, asked me a curly question out of the blue. She asked, 'What is something you believe in to be true that no-one else believes in?' Well, I scratched my head a bit. The audience was sort of tittering a bit, saying: 'Where's this come from? What's this got to do with innovation?' But I tried to answer the question as best I could, and I said: 'One thing I've always believed very strongly about my fellow human beings is that, ultimately, there's good in everybody. It's important to understand and try and get to the essence of our fellow man and, where possible, put ourselves in the shoes of others.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next day, ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues, I began walking in the shoes of tens of thousands of Australian cancer sufferers. I return now to this place with all that I've learnt from walking in those shoes, with the gift of new life and an enthusiasm and determination to continue my work on fostering an innovation mindset in Australia, encouraging our industry and researchers to collaborate and innovate, supporting the start-ups to build a sustainable innovation system and the jobs of the future, embracing the extraordinary possibilities of digital technologies, AI and machine learning, and applying all of this to ensuring that all Australians live better, work better and have every opportunity to share in the rewards of this transforming modern nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In all those months of treatment, I saw a lot of suffering around me, for sure. But what really struck me and stayed with me were people's hope and good humour in the face of their suffering. I witnessed the resilience of the human spirit up close, including through my colleague Senator Bilyk, who has been through so much over the years. It really moved me; it uplifted me; it helped me build my own resilience and optimism and my profound respect and confidence in my fellow Australians and the future we can build together.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  May I say, before I start: thank you, Senator Sinodinos, for that wonderful speech. I hope it gives hope to a number of cancer patients.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a different topic, a little over a week ago I visited Huonville with the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, and the member for Franklin, Julie Collins. We visited the fire evacuation centre in Huonville and spoke to evacuees and the volunteers preparing food for them. I know that my colleague Senator Brown has also visited the centre. It's really important in a crisis such as this that political leaders visit to get an appreciation of the scale of the disaster and how locals are affected, to show solidarity and to give people comfort that they are focused on the crisis and ready to provide whatever support they can. As such, I appreciate that the Prime Minister also has visited Huonville. Can I say, though, that getting the timing right is an issue for politicians. We don't want to go down there looking like we're disaster tourists, but I think we got the timing right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of Tasmania's fires are still burning as I speak, although recent rain has helped firefighters to get them under control and we're hoping to see an end to them soon. However, the Tasmania Fire Service has warned Tasmanians not to get complacent, even though the threat has diminished. There are still over 20 active fires in Tasmania. So far, the fires have burnt more than 200,000 hectares, or around three per cent of the state's total landmass. Considering the scale of the disaster, I'm amazed, but also incredibly grateful, that no lives have been lost, and property damage has been surprisingly small for a fire event on this scale. This may be considered a lucky outcome, but there has been a lot more than luck at play. This outcome is owed in a significant degree to our emergency services personnel—police, fire and State Emergency Service—who have worked hard to contain fires, to protect properties and to ensure that people under threat have been moved to safety. There have been close to 500 personnel fighting the fires, including 175 firefighters from interstate and New Zealand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On our visit to Huonville, Bill, Julie and I met with the pilots of some of the firefighting aircraft that have been dropping water on the fire front. Air support is a powerful weapon in modern firefighting and we certainly appreciate the contribution of these pilots and their aircraft. We also saw an army of volunteers who had been working day in, day out to provide vital support and relief at the evacuation centre. I thank these volunteers for their extraordinary contribution. What has been an incredibly stressful time for hundreds of Tasmanians has been made easier because of the efforts of hundreds of others who have given their time freely to help. Thank you to all the volunteers for your service in helping to keep your fellow Tasmanians safe, fed and sheltered. It's a comfort to all Tasmanians to know that, when they are affected by disasters such as this, there are people ready and willing to lend a hand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one volunteer I want to give a special thanks to. This volunteer's name is Lachlan. I met with Lachlan and his mother in Huonville. Lachlan was due to start school just a couple of days after we met him, but he had been evacuated from his home some days before. Every day that he was at that evacuation centre with his mum, Lachlan helped prepare meals for the fireys while his dad was actually out fighting the fires. The most incredible part of this story is that Lachlan is six years old, and he'd been over there working—not just sitting around but actually working—helping his mum to organise the food for the fireys. I think that's an extraordinary contribution from rather an extraordinary young man who is no doubt going through a difficult time but was still prepared to lend a hand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also incredibly grateful for the efforts of our local firefighters and for the assistance we've been receiving from interstate and overseas. I extend my thanks in particular to the volunteers from the Tasmania Fire Service and the SES—and, can I say, to their employers, for releasing them to allow them to go and fight the fires. While they served side by side with professionals, these volunteers are highly trained and highly competent, and they give up their time without any financial reward to enter what is a potentially dangerous situation so that they can help their fellow Tasmanians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If it wasn't for the amazing efforts of the professional and voluntary personnel, the toll from these fires, in lives and in property, could have been so much worse. But saying the toll could have been worse is not to dismiss the enormous financial, emotional and psychological impact we know this disaster has had on a number of people. Yes, only seven houses have been lost; but the loss of even one home can be devastating for the residents. And while only a few houses have been destroyed, many more have received minor fire damage, or water damage from sprinkler systems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hundreds of people have also been displaced for weeks. They've been on high alert and have had to deal with the uncertainty of not knowing when they can go home or whether they will have homes to return to. Being advised to leave your home, having the road close behind you and having to live in an evacuation centre for a couple of weeks must be incredibly stressful. And, while the stress that residents are going through right now is an immediate concern, we can't lose sight of the longer-term impacts that the fires will have. These fires are going to cause substantial damage to Tasmania's economy, particularly in affected communities. A number of businesses south of Huonville have been inaccessible to tourists for many weeks now, and towns such as Geeveston, Dover and Southport will likely struggle to get visitors for some time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among the 200,000 hectares burnt are vast tracts of Tasmanian wilderness, including the Mount Field National Park. This is affecting the park's visitor centre and a number of bushwalking attractions. The Tahune Airwalk, one of the major tourist attractions in the Huon Valley, has suffered fire damage and is likely to be closed for a substantial amount of time. Geeveston is heavily reliant on tourism, and the airwalk receives 150,000 visitors a year, which provide flow-on benefits to many other local businesses. And, sadly, some important historic Tasmanian heritage has been lost in the fire, including Churchill's Hut. A sprinkler system was installed around the hut, which was built in the 1920s by trapper Elias Churchill, but it was unable to save the historic property from the fire. And just in case you're wondering what was so significant about Churchill's Hut, Churchill caught the last thylacine to be held in captivity in 1933, before it was transported to Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will take time for communities to recover economically and psychologically. The Huon Valley fires are in the electorate of Franklin, where my office is, and I know the member for Franklin, Julie Collins, has been in regular contact with the mayor, Bec Enders, and has paid several visits to the area. And the mayor, Bec Enders, has done an amazing job down there. She's a newly elected mayor; she herself was evacuated from her home during the fires but kept on going, making sure that the residents in the area were well looked after. And of course Julie and I would be happy to help anyone who's been affected by the fires and has questions about what help and support is available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A natural disaster has been declared in the local government areas of the Huon Valley, the Derwent Valley, the Central Highlands and West Coast, where Senator Urquhart is based. There are a number of state and federal financial assistance programs for which people affected may be eligible, including the temporary living expenses grant, the replacement of household items grant, the recovery and restoration grant and the disaster recovery allowance. I know Julie Collins, as the member for Franklin, will be focusing on helping those from her electorate, but for people affected in other areas I know the member for Lyons, Brian Mitchell, and the member for Braddon, Justine Keay, and Senator Urquhart will be happy to help in any way they can. For residents in Geeveston and surrounding areas, the Tasmania Fire Service is holding a community meeting to provide an update on the Riveaux Road bushfire. This meeting will be held from 7 pm on Thursday, 14 February—that's tomorrow—at the Geeveston Community Hall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth remembering also that the anniversary of the deadly Black Tuesday fires of 1967 was on 7 February—only a few days ago. As well as being the 52nd anniversary of Black Tuesday, it was also the 10th anniversary of Victoria's Black Saturday bushfires, in which thousands of homes were destroyed and 173 people lost their lives. The anniversaries of both Black Saturday and Black Tuesday are a timely reminder of how devastating bushfires can potentially be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was invited by the Snug volunteer fire brigade to attend a memorial service for the Black Saturday anniversary on 7 February and to lay a floral tribute, and I really appreciate Snug Fire Brigade's invitation as well as their extraordinary contribution to this season's firefighting efforts. Memories of the Black Tuesday fires of 1967 have been seared into the minds of many of Snug's older residents. Of the 64 people who died in the Black Tuesday fires, 11 were from the township of Snug. That township was virtually destroyed, losing around two-thirds of its buildings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are no strangers to natural disasters and the threat they pose to people and property. But, as destructive and tragic as these natural disasters are, they also bring out the best in us. The way we come together during natural disasters is a perfect demonstration of the community spirit that is typical of Australians. We have a strong culture of banding together and lending a hand whenever people face a crisis or are in need. It is exactly that kind of community spirit that Bill Shorten, Julie Collins and I saw in Huonville.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  One hundred million dollars is the amount of corporate donations that the Labor, Liberal and National parties have taken since 2012—$100 million from industries like the banks, big mining, property developers, alcohol, pharma and gambling. They're just some of the industries that have paid the Liberal, National and Labor parties to put their private profits ahead of the needs of our community. One hundred million dollars isn't even the full picture. It doesn't include money paid to attend so-called business forums or cash for access meetings, and it doesn't include money that's funnelled through fundraising bodies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We actually don't know just how much money corporations pay into the Labor, Liberal and National parties each year, because our political system lacks the transparency it needs, but we can see what those donations are buying. They're buying influence in political decisions and policies. Big mining, the big banks, developers, and alcohol, property development and gambling companies donate tens of millions of dollars to the big political parties because it gets results, not because they believe in the institution of strong democracy. Labor, the Liberals and the Nationals are collecting hundreds of millions of dollars for their election campaign coffers while big corporations get the access and the policy outcomes they need to boost their profits. And the politicians themselves? Well, they get wined and dined and, when they step out of politics to 'spend more time with their families', they walk into cushy lobbyist jobs in the very industries they were supposed to regulate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cosy relationship between the Liberals, the Nationals, Labor and their corporate donors impacts all of us. Since 2012, the fossil fuel and resources industries have donated over $7½ million to both of the major parties. They get $6 billion a year in fossil fuel subsidies. That's cheap fuel and accelerated depreciation that the rest of us don't get. That's a pretty good return on investment. It's about $2,000 in subsidies for every dollar they donate—a very sound investment on their part indeed. Those generous donations have also bought them a Liberal government that is completely paralysed by the words 'climate change'. We've got half the government ready to tear up the Paris Agreement and lock Australia into a future of more extreme bushfires, crippling droughts and floods and the other half of the Liberal government able to admit that we should do something about it only once they've left the party. So now we have a Liberal-National government with no climate policy at all, which is of course not surprising when you remember those $7½ million in donations and, of course, the time our Prime Minister brandished a lump of coal in parliament and gleefully told us all: 'Don't be scared. It won't hurt you.' I reckon the folks in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania who've suffered through some of the worst droughts, bushfires and, now, floods that their states have ever seen would beg to differ.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are not much better, sadly. They're taking the Liberals' energy policy to the election—the very same energy policy that the Libs binned and turfed former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over. Let's also not forget that no coalmine or coal seam gas project has ever been rejected federally by this government or by the opposition when they were in government. Thanks to the cosy relationship the Labor, Liberal and National parties have with the fossil fuel industry, the only plan they've got for my home state of Queensland is more coalmines—and at a time when the rest of the world is turning its back on coal. It is negligent to lock our state into an industry that destroys other industries, destroys nature, destroys our very safety, won't be profitable in years to come and won't deliver on the promises that it makes. Labor and the Liberals are both backing dirty great coalmines and the pollution that they bring. They're backing a boom-and-bust cycle that cripples communities while wilfully turning a blind eye to the coal industry's rapid move to full automation, which will leave Queensland workers in the lurch, unable to pay their mortgages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another major donor to the major parties has been the banking and financial sector. It's given about $60 million since 2012 to both sides of politics. It's been obvious for years that the banking sector was ripping customers off and acting like it was above the law. Of course, essentially, it was, and comfortable with the fact that the major parties were too addicted to their donors and their donations to pull them up. Both of the major parties had to be dragged to the banking royal commission, following scandal after scandal and the public backlash over their inaction. Labor caved earlier, it must be said, but the Greens first started campaigning for the banking royal commission in August 2014. It took two years after that for Labor to come on board and it took another year and a half after that for the Liberals to come on board. Of course, they voted against it 26 times. You have to wonder how much faster it would have happened if the Liberal, National and Labor parties weren't on the payroll of the banks, with those corporate donations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fossil fuel and banking industries are far from the only sectors that have bought the government. There is a suburb not too far from where I live in Brisbane. The population of this suburb has doubled in the last few decades. High-rises have popped up. It's a suburb fairly close to the city and it's a very convenient place to live. But the issue is that, while the number of people choosing to make this suburb their home has gone up, the amount of public space has halved, sold off to private developers. There has been no increase in public transport services to the area, there are no new schools, the existing local schools are bursting at the seams and the roads just get more and more congested. So the time that we all get to spend with our families doing the things we love is shrinking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The winners in this scenario are the property developers who build the apartments, the construction industry, the real estate sector and the banks. And, wouldn't you know it? Developers and construction companies have donated over $20 million to both sides of politics since 2012.</span>

But when the big end of town reckons that they need a tax break they're given one, to the tune of $65 billion. The big end of town is throwing money at the Labor and the Liberal parties hand over fist, but it is our communities that are paying the price.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, there are over 190,000 people on the social housing waiting list. One in two domestic violence victims are turned away from refuges because of a lack of beds. The rate of Newstart hasn't been raised since 1994. The NBN is in a shambles and the big banks are ripping Australians off while the banking execs and CEOs pocket millions in bonuses. The gap between the very rich and the rest of us just keeps widening—wages are flatlining and many of us are working longer for less pay, while others can't find enough work. And, all the while, the costs for electricity, health and public transport keep going up and up—and privatisation has only made that worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it doesn't have to be this way. We can create a future where all of us have what we need to live a good life. This means building world-class public schools, affordable housing, better access to quality health care and social services for everyone, regardless of our postcode, our parents or our bank balance. It means stopping the Liberal and Labor governments from further privatising our essential services, like electricity, banking and the internet, and providing publicly owned providers to reduce prices and run reliable services that everyone can rely on. It means transitioning rapidly to renewable energy to protect our planet from the threat of climate change and providing good, steady well-paying jobs in the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can build this future if we make corporations and the very wealthy pay their fair share of tax, but we won't be able to until we can get the influence of big money and vested interests off our parliament and out of our politics. We need to ban the donations from the big end of town that have bought such policy influence over this parliament. It's time for that era of buying political influence and policy outcomes to come to an end. No more is our community willing to be left with peanuts while politicians and their corporate sector mates line their own pockets. The Greens refuse donations from corporations who want to buy influence. We fight for the needs of our community, not the interests of corporate donors. This parliament should do the same. Together we can, and must, do better. All of our future depends on it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263418" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  It's a delight to be here to talk about something I have a great deal of interest in—that is, backing those who back themselves, people who are willing to take a risk to improve things for their community and their families and make a real go of things in this land of opportunity, Australia. By that, I'm talking about small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a delight for me to join with locals in the community just outside of Hobart, a fairly regional community, Sorell, at the official opening of the Daly Potato Company expanded facilities. The Daly Potato Company is owned and run by Susie and Gerard Daly, with the able assistance of their daughter, Ruby, who actually runs the alcohol distilling arm of the business—which I suspect is perhaps the more exciting arm of the business. But the Daly Potato Company is one that works very hard in the local community, employing people from the Sorell community and surrounding districts and investing in the local region, but does a great deal to value-add to the primary produce from that region, particularly with the use of potatoes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They recently received a grant of $300,000 from the regional jobs and investment program, which was more than matched by their own contribution to expand their production facilities to value-add to the products that they produce, such as the potato salads which are on sale throughout major supermarkets across Australia, and the demand keeps growing. Through the grant, the $300,000 provided by the Liberal-National government, they've been able to employ an extra 14 people from that community where jobs are needed. It was great to be there with them to officially open their expanded facilities, to meet some of those people who had landed extra work at a time when it is needed, of course, and to see that spirit of entrepreneurship, people who have an idea, are willing to give it a go and who sometimes need the backing of perhaps government to make things work. And to reinvest in their local community was a great thing. I commend the Daly family, Gerard, Susie, and, of course, Ruby. I look forward to seeing their business grow into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sticking with Tasmania, it was also great to head to the north of the state, to the wonderful community of the west Tamar for the official opening of the Exeter Community Hub. The west Tamar is a growing community north of Launceston, which will be in the electorate of Bass at the next federal election. I joined with somewhere between 150 and 200 locals at the official opening of the government funded Exeter Community Hub.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Exeter and the surrounding communities, Beaconsfield and Lagana, are growing at a great rate. Regional Tasmania, northern Tasmania, is seeing a great many people returning there for work, for family reasons and for lifestyle, so it's important these communities keep up with the demand for proper community and public facilities to ensure that the lifestyle that we have in Tasmania is protected. It was great to be a part of the announcement, the $1 million contribution made by the Liberal government, a promise made by former member for Lyons, Eric Hutchinson, to renew and expand these facilities. I had a good look around the facilities, and it was great to meet members of the community services club, the Inner Wheel association, the ladies' Probus and, of course, the film society, to name but a few groups who are going to be making full use of the facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the opening, we had the regular bowls club playing their tournament outside. It will be a fantastic facility. I commend members of the community, the west Tamar and, in particular, the Exeter communities, led by their mayor Christina Holmdahl, supported well by the general manager Rolph Vos, who have delivered a lot for that community. It is a pleasure to be working with them, and I look forward to working with the west Tamar community a lot into the future, because it's those communities that deserve our backing, who want to facilitate the growth that we need to see in regional communities and ensure that we have the right lifestyle in these beautiful small towns across Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'd like to talk about a matter that a number of my colleagues have spoken about. It is an issue that has arisen over the summer months: the bushfires. I know that all of my Labor, Green, Independent and, of course, Liberal colleagues have expressed their sympathies to those who've sustained losses during this awful period. What I'd like to remark on is the community resilience. The resilience that has been demonstrated by those who have been affected by these devastating fires—how quickly they took hold in our community—is something that I was astounded by. At the peak, there were around 70 fires burning across the state of Tasmania, many of them started by the dry lightning storm that passed through on 15 January. There has been over 200,000 hectares of land affected by these fires. That ranges from productive land—forestry plantations and farmland—through to wilderness reserves and the like, which is a devastating thing. Most concerning in the Huon community is that the Tahune Airwalk infrastructure has been damaged, which will have a major impact on that community. There are 80,000 visitors to the Tahune area every year, which is in the Huon Valley and which now won't be attracting visitors. So we need to make sure that we work hard to ensure that we support that community as it rebuilds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to pay tribute to those who battled the fires in our state. The conditions were terrible—windy, hot and dry. We have over 5,000 volunteer firies in the state of Tasmania who contributed to the firefighting effort. They are people who've taken time out of their holidays with their families and time away from work to ensure that our communities are safe and to protect those things that need protecting—namely, life and our community assets and property. Alongside the paid staff from the Tasmanian Fire Service, Sustainable Timber Tasmania and the Parks and Wildlife Service, they've done a great job in managing the devastating impact of the fire. It was wonderful to see the interstate support that our state received during the bushfires and, indeed, the support from New Zealand with personnel on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More heartening was the fact that Tasmanians in their thousands donated to support those who had been displaced by these events. People had to evacuate the communities they live in and leave behind their homes. Thankfully, the damage to property was not extensive. Having said that, it is always very, very saddening to hear that anyone has lost part or all of their home, which, sadly, was the case for a number of families in Tasmania. I saw our community band together in these tough times, such as when I went to the Maydena community briefing—it is a community that faced threat for an extended period of time from the Gell River fire in the Derwent Valley—and talked firsthand to the locals about the impending threat coming to them. The support they were providing one another and the cooperation with government agencies was a wonderful thing to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now it is time for us to support those communities that were affected, as I alluded to earlier. People, and tourists in particular, were told to steer clear of the regions that have been affected by bushfires. I was talking to the former manager of Waterfalls cafe in Mount Field National Park, Rachel Power. They lost a huge amount of business as a result of the evacuation orders. Visitors stopped going there. I was talking to the team at the Derwent Valley information centre in New Norfolk. The number of people going through that area has dropped off markedly, compared with previous years. So my message, and I'm sure my Tasmanian colleagues would join with me in this, is get back into these communities, support these businesses—the restaurants, the cafes and the shops—in the communities that were affected in the Huon, the Central Highlands and the Derwent Valley and spend money. We need to support these regional communities, both as a government and as individuals. Tourism in these areas is critical to their economies. As we head into winter, which is the season when things do slow down, these communities are going to need support. So visiting these communities and calling into the shops that are open for business and are ready to trade again will be a wonderful thing. I urge all of my colleagues from right across Australia to come to Tassie, spend a few dollars in the Huon, the Central Highlands and the Derwent Valley and support those who were affected.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I want to make a contribution in senators' statements about my work in the electorate of Grey, which is my duty seat. It's in relation to road funding and a pressing issue which is arising on the Eyre Peninsula. Just by way of preamble, the financial assistance grants which were handed out to councils around Australia were frozen by the Hon. Tony Abbott's budget in 2014. This cost councils around Australia about $600 million. In South Australia in particular, it had an effect of about $40 million. That financial assistance grant has been restored, but there has been a shortfall in funding for, particularly, regional roads. The continuation of that grant is up for speculation, so to speak, at the end of the 2019-20 budget. It's well known that South Australia's local government manages 11 per cent of the nation's roads, has around 7.2 per cent of the nation's population and receives an unfair allocation. The Commonwealth Grants Commission recommended that South Australia should receive about 8.9 per cent of road funding. That didn't happen. The Howard government did increase it to 7.9 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to set the scene, there is a shortfall in funding for regional roads. And I'm sure, Mr Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan, you would have a good knowledge of the shortfall in the various electorates in Queensland. What that has done is put immense pressure on regional councils to maintain roads to a reasonable standard. Unfortunately, the evidence is that we do not have that reasonable standard. We have no separation. The proper standard should be a metre and a half of separation between traffic on a two-way highway. We don't have that. In addition to that, we should have appropriate treatments on the shoulders of those roads, and we do not have that, so we have no separation and poor-to-non-existent treatments on the side of the road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have on top of this already parlous situation is perhaps a closure of a regional rail service which is taking 800,000 tonnes of grain on the Eyre Peninsula to the loading facility at Port Lincoln. We are told that there is perhaps going to be a closure as early as 31 May this year. That will result in the loss of some jobs, and people in that area are extremely concerned about those 70 local jobs which may be in jeopardy. We were also told the South Australian transport minister and the operator of the rail, Genesee &amp; Wyoming, did a study which was due to be released in the latter half of last year, 2018—it still hasn't seen the light of day—that would investigate what is necessary to continue the enormous economic benefit that agriculture has in the Eyre Peninsula region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've written to the minister, the Hon. Stephan Knoll, and I haven't received anything other than an automated response. I accept that ministers are busy and the like, but the simple fact is this: 503 South Australians have lost their lives on regional roads in South Australia in the last eight years. That's double the number of South Australians who have lost their lives in the city. That is just abundant, clear evidence that it is much more dangerous on poorly maintained, less-than-high-standard regional roads. That is without question. If you ask the RAA, if you ask any competent authority in the region, there is concern being expressed here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this rail does not continue to cart 800,000 tonnes of grain successfully through to the Port Lincoln loading facility, it would mean there would be 30,000 additional B-double trucks on the roads per annum. That's 30,000 additional B-double trips to carry 800,000 tonnes of grain. This is a situation which is almost akin to catastrophic. For those who have been to the beautiful city of Port Lincoln and who have travelled along the coastline to Ceduna, there are a lot of tourists on that road. There are grey nomads on that road all the time. All forms of caravans, trailers and recreational activity vehicles are frequently moving along at their pace. If you were to throw 30,000 additional truck movements into that area—I'm a trucking person and I'm a supporter of road transport—it would be almost catastrophic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is akin to negligence in this area that there is no clear communication with Regional Development Australia, Port Lincoln council, Elliston council or any of the regional councils on the Eyre Peninsula. They are crying out for information about what the minister is going to do in this space, but it is, 'I will consider it and make a decision whenever I get around to it.' The reality is that people are thinking the closure may be as imminent—as early as 31 May. This is not a situation that can go unreported. The local media is asking the minister for a decision. The issues are well known. The local councils do not have the funds to do the road improvements that are necessary to make this sort of transport safe. If you are to add 30,000 truck movements to already failing, poorly maintained and low-standard roads, you are imposing an unacceptable risk in an area where people are already paying a really high price for this lack of investment. The obvious answer would be to deal with Genesee &amp; Wyoming and make sure the rail continues as it should, until such time as the road improvements are made or there's a proper definitive safety audit of what risks you are going to impact this community with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It isn't a Labor stronghold—trust me, Mr Acting Deputy President. I have lots of acquaintances in the area but probably not too many electoral supporters. They are all very, very anxious about this situation. They are smart people. They grow the produce of this nation, they own trucks, they're on the road, they partake in their local areas by participating as chairs of their local area associations and/or as mayors of their local councils. They are at a loss to understand how this level of movement of 800,000 tonnes from rail to road would be a prudent, safe thing to do. They have called on their minister, Stephan Knoll, to make an early decision. Most of the commentators are saying that a sensible minister would continue with an arrangement that supported the rail. If that doesn't happen, the area could be a very difficult place to move around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the department has taken proactive steps in this. They are doing chain-of-responsibility workshops in all of the areas around the Eyre Peninsula. That is really to say that the person who owns the truck or the person who consigns the freight will be ultimately responsible. But where is the responsibility being taken by the relevant minister and, indeed, the federal government into making sure that the funding is there so these roads are safe to travel on? In my view, it's not there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place today, the road transport industry is advocating for a safe rates regime to apply federally across this country. This is the reason why we are so in need of a safe rates regime in this federal parliament. It is clear the local government can't meet its responsibilities because there's been a combination of a lack of leadership at the state level and a lack of funding from the federal level. All of this is compounding into an unsafe workplace for a truck driver and an unsafe road for a person going about their normal business. It could be the school bus that has to do 60 kilometres from the farm gate to the local school and dodge a B-double truck on its way to and from school. I've advocated for people in this area to reduce 100 or 110 down to 80 past their local communities. We have been successful in that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adding 30,000 additional truck movements on poorly maintained road with an incorrect separation on a two-way highway in regional Australia that contributes $25 billion to the South Australian economy is absolutely reprehensible and incorrect, and minister should be castigated.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="111206" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  You can tell which countries are better and which are worse. People vote with their feet. People are voting with their feet to come to Australia. They're also voting with their feet to go to other functional liberal democracies around the world. By this measure, Australia is better than most, and so are Singapore, Germany and the United States. In contrast, people are voting with their feet to leave countries like China and Venezuela. This tells us something. It tells us we shouldn't emulate China, with its strongman leader for life, it's Big Brother nanny state, its pervasive surveillance, its government intervention and manipulation of industry and trade, its massive diversion of resources into the military and police, and its mountains of debt. We shouldn't emulate Venezuela, where guns are banned but violent crime is rife and where socialism means nearly everything is subsidised. Nearly everything, from milk to medicines, is subject to price controls, but the shop shelves are empty, with what resources that remain being funnelled to those connected to the Maduro regime. In case anyone thinks this is irrelevant to us, remember that, right now, in Australia, there are calls to regulate the price of milk and that we already have regulated prices of medicines. In Australia, the idea of a no-nonsense, tough-talking leader is ever popular, as are calls to boost police numbers, ban guns, extend the nanny state, protect industry and not worry about budget deficits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a country built on immigrants, and a prosperous and secure future depends on that continuing. We need people to continue voting with their feet and choosing Australia. But not all immigrants are equal in terms of their value to the country. Some who seek to migrate to Australia are looking for a handout from the Australian taxpayer. We don't want them and we shouldn't allow them. Most are looking for a land where you can go about your business, keep most of the fruits of your labour and buy what you want and need, and, of course, where the ruling politicians, the courts and police don't threaten to take you from your family. Such migrants are the kind Australia has welcomed for 200 years. How can we ensure we attract more of the kinds of migrants we want and as few as possible of the kind we don't want? One way would be to remove access to welfare until they become citizens. With no welfare available, those contemplating voting with their feet to come to Australia would only do so if they knew they could make a go of it. Those who felt they weren't up to it or expected to rely on welfare before too long would have second thoughts. Of course, that would not apply to those on humanitarian visas. Australia accepts more of those per capita that any other country, except Canada, but their numbers are still tiny in comparison to our total migration numbers. It is right that we provide a refuge for people fleeing persecution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another way to establish an incentive to attract the right people would be created by charging migrants a high price for a permanent resident's visa. With no welfare available if they can't work, the migrants who then continue to come to Australia would be topnotch. If any of them struck some bad luck and we wanted to be generous in individual cases, we would, first of all, expect their family or employer to take care of them, but, even after that, we could justify helping an occasional individual because they have paid the high fee. It would be abundantly clear to all but the looniest amongst us that these are new Australians we can be proud of, including some who would probably improve our soccer and cricket teams. Obviously, we need to maintain character, criminal and health tests on all potential migrants. If we detect intolerant medieval attitudes, we should ban that migrant too. There should be no tolerance of intolerance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Upholding such standards continues to make us attractive to those who vote with their feet. We can have a liberal democracy, a liberal society, with equality before the law and we can have democracy—but only if we are choosey about who we accept as migrants. Open borders—meaning we are not choosey about who we accept—risk allowing in those who hate our liberal society and who can then become a major voting bloc. To defend our liberal society, we must be able to name its enemies. One enemy is radical Islam. That perversion is intent on murdering infidels, apostates and, most of all, other Muslims who don't comply with their dictates. Another enemy is those who would seek to appease radical Islam. We must never bend to radical Islam, whether deciding to allow a synagogue to be built in our suburbs or deciding to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the process of protecting us from radical Islam, we should be alert to the potential to chip away at what makes our liberal democracy. We have well-resourced agencies to intercept the communications of would-be terrorists, so the spectre of terrorism can't be wheeled out to justify intercepting and storing the communications of the majority of Australians who are not suspects and who never communicate with suspects. The communications of the vast majority of Australians are none of the government's business, they are none of ASIO's business, and they are definitely none of the business of the ATO or your local council. And we need to remember that government storage of our communications is an easy target for hackers, making us less safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is great. Along with other liberal democracies around the world, people are voting with their feet to come here. They are drawn to a society built on trust, where your life, liberty and property are respected, where we leave people alone but where intolerance is not tolerated. Long may this continue.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  I'm pleased to see you in the chair for this speech, Mr Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan. The recent floods in the north and the cheerful responsiveness of northerners to this and other regular calamities that are part of our life up there highlight my absolute passion for the north and its people, with their courage, compassion, generosity and genuine friendliness. I guess this passion is inbred in me as my parents and grandparents were all born and raised in the north, in Cloncurry. There is no greater northerner, I have to say, than my wonderful wife, Lesely, born and bred in Ayr, whose love and enthusiasm and support has enabled me to do the things that I've done in my life and without whom I would never have been able to achieve what little I may have achieved in my almost 40 years in public life—11 years as a councillor on the Burdekin Shire Council and now 28 years in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The way northerners respond to these calamities and challenges has again been evident over the past few weeks, and that's what makes the north so special to me. I particularly want to mention the Army at the Lavarack Barracks, whose immediate presence in calamities is such a comfort during those times of crisis. This was made possible by the presence in Townsville of Australia's largest Army base, Lavarack Barracks, where I had the honour just a couple of years ago of officiating at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the opening of that base.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years I've been fortunate to have had assistance from a team of northerners in my office, who've helped me do my job—from my first staffers, Xenia; Leanne; and Guy, and all those in between up to my present staffers, Marie; James; Matthew; Michael; Sharon; Lorraine; and my friend and former colleague Peter Lindsay, the former MP for Herbert, who has come on board at this time to help with assisting those recovering from the floods. I should mention also the help that many non-northerners have given me and who I've had the privilege of working with in my ministerial office, led by some wonderful chiefs of staff—Russ Street, Mark Elliott, Robert Reid and Phil Connole. I also acknowledge the many senior public servants who've always help me do my best for Australia, all of whom I've worked with started as employees but have ended up as lifelong friends. The northerners whom I've been associated with and have loved are typified by my old friends Peter and Lorraine Henderson, Tony and Juanita Chandler and my longstanding, supportive friends in the Burdekin branch of the Liberal Party in Ayr, led by the wonderful Neville Dickinson and his wife, Elvie. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the election approaches, it's my determination to be re-elected, to give the north a true voice in this parliament. Regrettably, I'm the only senator from North Queensland in the parliament at the current time. Other parties may choose to parachute Brisbane candidates into northern offices, but they will never represent the people of the north like a true northerner can. I hope that when I eventually do leave this place I will be replaced by a true northerner who has empathy with the north and who can genuinely represent their views, because it's only by having a strong local voice that things can be achieved. There are things like the original establishment of Lavarack Barracks, which I mentioned; the recent expansion to accommodate the 14,000 Singaporean troops that will be based in Townsville for training in the future; and the university in the north. I might proudly add to that the establishment of the very first non-capital city medical school at that university, which I played a very small part in. There are also the new research and education facilities that abound in the north and the development of the north following the implementation of the northern Australian development white paper, which I was able to have a Liberal government adopt. There are the little things like the thousands of individuals whom I've been able to help with their own issues and those of their groups, who, without a voice in the north, without someone in town, so to speak, may not have been able to have been assisted. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As one of the very few parliamentarians from the north who has achieved ministerial rank, I've been able to kick some goals for northern Australia, such as the northern white paper that I mentioned, which started its gestation back in 2004; for local government, of which I've been a part and where I had the honour of being honoured at their recent convention; for the Australian territories; for our forestry industries, which played such an important role in the 2004 election, when, dare I say, I and the CFMEU fought to protect local workers' jobs in the forestry industry; and for the fishing industries, where, amongst other assistance to local industries, we were able to establish the very significant central and western Pacific fisheries tuna commission. We also fought and won the battle against the pirates stealing Australia's rare but valuable Patagonian toothfish. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been privileged to serve in this parliament from humble beginnings, from a humble family. I put myself through law school, externally, while studying in my community. I was involved in sporting events as well as community and business events. There are my 11 years on the council and my service in parliament as currently Australia's longest serving parliamentarian. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge and thank the Liberal Party and all of its real supporters for their support and guidance over many years—too many names to mention but I do want to particularly mention the Hon. John Moore, who was there when I started and who assisted me considerably throughout my time in this parliament. I've made some real friends in this place over the years. I acknowledge the wonderful support given to parliamentarians by the staff in the chambers, by attendants, by Comcar, by transport officers and particularly by committee staff, who do an incredible job. One of my committees this week has produced some five reports in urgency but with brilliance. I suspect that, whenever I leave, the IT and 2020 people will be quite relieved! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate is not the same place as it was when I first entered, and sometimes I fear for our parliamentary democracy. But now is not the time for that; perhaps that's a speech which I will be able to make in the new parliament. The fact that many parliamentarians read all of their speeches is, I think, a backward step, although my preference for off-the-cuff speeches does run the danger of omitting important people or facts, and I fear this may be the case in this speech, which has been made in haste, in just 10 minutes, as part of the regular senators' statements part of our program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we approach the election, I wish everyone a rewarding election and success, especially those on this side of the chamber. And I do believe the government will be returned. It is a good government; it's doing some amazing things and is very well led. I have confidence that Scott Morrison will be returned as Prime Minister whenever the election is held.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my maiden speech, the future of the nation lies in the north. I believe that there's still a lot more the north can do and can contribute to our nation. I hope that in my time in the Senate I've been able to play a small part in developing the north, and so making a worthwhile contribution to our nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I want to start by echoing the thoughts of Senator Macdonald, particularly for those in Townsville, close to his home town, and for those in the north-west as well, which is obviously still suffering. I acknowledge the message that Senator Macdonald said in that regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This will probably be of interest for Senator Macdonald—and, indeed, yourself, Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan, and probably for Senator Watt—as I'm sure Senator Macdonald is very excited about the news that Labor's No. 1 Senate candidate for the next election does live in Cairns. It would be fantastic, if Nita Green is lucky enough to be elected, to have some Senate representation in Cairns. And I note that, as the LNP continually neglect regional Queensland, it will be an important step by federal Labor to ensure that regional Queensland still does have good representation in the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's actually regional Queensland that I want to talk about, and particularly a bus trip that I recently went on through Queensland with the federal Labor leader, Bill Shorten. I also acknowledge my colleague Senator Murray Watt, who was with me for a long time on that bus trip. I think it's fair to say that the Labor bus trip, federal Labor leader Bill Shorten's bus trip, was what I would call a fair dinkum bus trip, not like the bogus bus trip we saw from the Prime Minister, where he basically flew into various towns, hopped on a bus for a couple for minutes, got off, went to an event and then jumped back on an aeroplane. I know federal Labor leader Bill Shorten travelled on the bus from Brisbane to Townsville, all the way along the Bruce Highway. The reason that's important is because when you do that, you actually get a full and proper understanding of their neglect by the federal LNP government of Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, there's no better example of that than the Bruce Highway. Year after year—they've been in government now for six years—they've continued to neglect the Bruce Highway. They elect LNP members, but those members don't actually push the case here in Canberra to deliver for the Bruce Highway. The Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, wouldn't have a clue about that, because he didn't actually travel on the Bruce Highway to get an understanding of how important it is to Queensland and how it is the beating heart, the artery of Queensland that makes the whole state pump. Federal Labor leader Bill Shorten got a really good understanding of that, having travelled all the way from Brisbane to Townsville.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we do this is because it's part of federal Labor leader Bill Shorten's commitment to Queensland and to regional Queensland. Since the last election, federal Labor leader Bill Shorten has spent 95 days in Queensland, and a lot of those have been in regional Queensland. As part of that, he's done 27 town hall forums, including one in Bundaberg in January, and also one in Yeppoon that Senator Watt was at. We do these forums because they're such a great opportunity for us to hear firsthand from the Australian people about what their concerns are, and then we are able to bring those back to parliament and use them as we formulate the policies that we then take to the Australian people. But we're only able to do these things because we have such strong candidates in these Queensland seats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to talk about the bus trip and actually step through it because it was really important for the towns we visited. As we get closer to an election, the issues we cover and the announcements we make along the way show those people that federal Labor are listening and, more importantly, we're acting so that those people in Queensland, and particularly regional Queensland, understand what a federal Labor government would deliver, as opposed to what we're seeing on the other side, which is just continual chaos and dysfunction. They're not actually putting forward a platform for the Queensland people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bus trip that federal Labor undertook started in the federal seat of Forde, where the Labor candidate, Des Hardman, is doing an outstanding job. There we made an announcement of $33.4 million for a Logan urgent care clinic. That will be really vital to easing the pressure on the emergency department, especially following the years of cuts from this federal LNP government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Continuing the health theme: in the electorate of Lilley, with federal Labor candidate Anika Wells, who's aiming to replace Wayne Swan, we announced a new MRI machine for the Prince Charles Hospital. Here we saw another example of how this LNP government is not listening to the local community and not meeting their concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Sunshine Coast there will be $5 million to support an internet submarine fibre cable. This is an important economic opportunity for the Sunshine Coast, which is crying out for further development and new industries in the area. Federal Labor recognised that, and Bill Shorten made a commitment along those lines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we took the bus along the Bruce Highway to Wide Bay electorate, where at Downer EDI we made an announcement about a national procurement plan. This is significant for Queensland, and particularly regional Queensland, because it is going to mean more jobs for local communities. It will mean that as part of a spend that any Labor government does federally there's going to be a local component so that there will be local jobs. The workers at Downer know that they can have a bright future and the company can plan for the future because there's going to be a federal Labor government looking after their interests and the interests of other workers as well. That was well received by the hundreds of workers that were in attendance as Bill made that announcement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we moved to the electorate of Hinkler—in particular, Bundaberg—where the federal Labor candidate there, Richard Pascoe, and Labor leader Bill Shorten made an announcement of $15.7 million to upgrade the Bundaberg Hospital. Anyone who's been to Bundaberg will understand that the hospital is vital to that area, particularly to its ageing population. Unfortunately, we know that the current Prime Minister has not been to Bundaberg once—not whilst he's been Prime Minister, not even whilst he's been a minister in this government. He has not even bothered to visit Bundaberg once, so how would he know what the needs of the local community are and how urgent it is that the local hospital get support?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting">Senator Watt interjecting</span>—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CHISHOLM:</span>
                  </a>  Once again, as Senator Watt pointed out, there is the neglect of the local LNP member, Mr Pitt, who has done nothing for that region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we went further north along the highway to Gladstone, in the electorate of Flynn, where we made a fantastic announcement about hydrogen. Federal Labor seized the opportunity that hydrogen will provide Australia into the future. As part of that, there was an announcement of $3 million for a Gladstone hydrogen innovation hub. This is federal Labor saying: we're not going to put all our eggs in one basket; we see that there are other industries that are going to play an important part in Australia's future and we want Gladstone and Queensland to be the hub of those. That was a significant announcement, very well received by the local community and the local mayor, which I know will deliver jobs—that federal Labor will be prepared to deliver on them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We continued further north to Rockhampton and the electorate of Capricornia, where, in conjunction with the fantastic Labor candidate there, Russell Robertson, we made an announcement of $800 million for the Rockhampton Ring-Road. We also announced $25 million to transform Great Keppel Island. That is somewhere that has been absolutely neglected by the local LNP member, who has done nothing for that area over the time that she has been there. Again it was well received by the local community. But we're only able to do this because we have good candidates who are in touch with their local communities and can push these issues, push this agenda, so that federal Labor can deliver for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We continued to go further north to the electorate of Dawson, with our fantastic candidate Belinda Hassan, where we made an announcement of $280 million for the Mackay Ring-Road—one, again, that the LNP member has done nothing about for so long. He talks a big game here in Canberra but does nothing when it comes to delivering for his local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We went further north to Proserpine, where we made an announcement of $5 million to help rebuild the Proserpine Entertainment Centre. That was devastated by the cyclone, but what have we seen from the LNP government? What we've seen from the LNP government is nothing. The Proserpine Entertainment Centre needs to be redeveloped. It's been sitting there and those opposite have done nothing about it. But federal Labor will deliver. We are listening to that community. We understand the damage that the cyclone did. Only federal Labor will deliver for that community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We continued on to Senator Macdonald's home town of Ayr, where we made a fantastic announcement, with the Mayor of Burdekin Shire, Lyn McLaughlin, of $5 million to help protect the Great Barrier Reef from wastewater harm in that area. Again, that was a significant announcement that we could only make because we'd been listening to the community. In federal Labor, we didn't do the bogus bus that Prime Minister Morrison did. We did the fair dinkum bus. We rode the whole way. Only federal Labor and Bill Shorten understand Queensland and particularly regional Queensland and will stand up for them, unlike those opposite.</span>
              </p>

The government is not, and will not, be distracted by the passage of this bill from our duty and responsibility to protect Australians. Our Liberal-Nationals government will continue to work hard to protect the integrity of our borders and our national security, as we have done every single day for the last 5½ years. Earlier today the Prime Minister convened a meeting of our National Security Committee to take the decisions that were necessary following on from the contingency planning that the government had been putting in place over the last couple of weeks.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have not taken the risks associated with the passage of this amendment Home Affairs bill lightly. We have been preparing very carefully for this eventuality. The government have decided to put in place a range of strengthening arrangements in order to ensure that Operation Sovereign Borders and our operations continue to be successful in preventing the illegal boat arrivals here in Australia that occurred over the six years of the previous Labor government. All of the actions and decisions that we as a government are taking are implementing the recommendations made to the government by our relevant national security agencies and officials present at our National Security Committee meeting this morning. We are adopting all of the recommendations they have put to us based on their advice in response to the decisions that have been taken in the Australian parliament. We are making sure that the Australian Border Force and the other agencies central to the successful execution and operation of Operation Sovereign Borders remain appropriately supported. Everything they are asking for they are getting. That has involved a strengthening of the capacity of Operation Sovereign Borders across a whole range of fronts. The Prime Minister has also made a series of other announcements which I can address in the next question.</span>

This parliament has already tipped its hand enough to the people smugglers. We won't be doing that and compromising our operations. What I can say to inform the Senate of the direct response to the legislation passed this morning is that the government has decided to approve the reopening of the Christmas Island detention centre facilities and a series of compounds, both to deal with the prospect of arrivals as well as dealing with the prospect of transfers. The full cost of those measures, as set out in a declassified briefing, is currently about $1.4 billion. The final cost of all necessary measures will be staged over the ramp-up of those facilities, and that is taking place in accordance with the recommendations from the secretary of Home Affairs. In relation to the implementation of the laws passed through the Senate earlier today, the Prime Minister has asked the Department of Home Affairs for an implementation report. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I refer to new evidence in relation to the unauthorised leaking of a Federal Police raid on the Australian Workers' Union offices that discloses Minister Cash's then chief of staff was the source of the leak. Minister Cash's then senior media adviser, when deciding to leak advance notice of police raids, was motivated by an intention to damage the Leader of the Opposition's reputation. The office of the then Minister for Justice was advised prior to the raids commencing by Minister Cash's office, and Minister Cash's then senior media adviser worked with the then Minister for Justice's media adviser to leak the raids to the media. In light of these revelations, has Mr Morrison sought and received assurances from Minister Cash that her statements to the Senate and all of her public statements have provided a full and frank account of her involvement in this affair?</span>

Yesterday, in response to questions, Minister Cash again indicated that she stood by those statements. Of course, we also know that this is a matter that is currently before the courts, and, as such, it wouldn't be appropriate for the government to comment any further. </span>

The answer to that question is an absolute Y-E-S yes. There is nothing in the attempted smear and innuendo that Senator Wong and other senators have tried to throw around that in any way contradicts the statements that Senator Cash has made in Senate estimates or in the Senate chamber in relation to these matters. Others might from time to time be making other claims which are currently being tested through a court process. The Senate should be allowing the court process to take its course in the ordinary course of events. There will be a resolution at the end of that process. It wouldn't be appropriate for the government to provide a running commentary in relation to these proceedings.</span>

The South Australian royal commission found details relating to water theft, maladministration and the unlawfulness of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan itself. Will this government listen to these recommendations and act, or will you follow your South Australian colleagues and simply sit on your hands and ignore findings that you don't like?</span>

The Water Act itself is a legitimate act that was passed by this parliament. This question about legal advice has been raised before. In fact, I think it was raised during the previous government's time as well. The government does not release legal advice in regard to legislation, although I would refer you to the fact that, I think, former Minister Burke some time ago released a summary of such legal advice that you can review. On the claims you've made about maladministration—and my advice is from the royal commission—most of those came on the commissioner's basis that the Water Act itself was invalid in the first place. We obviously disagree with that point of view based on our legal advice on the Water Act and therefore we don't accept those conclusions either.</span>

I pointed this out yesterday, but now I will to the whole chamber here in question time. That is that it is dams that help us regulate the system to protect fish. It is dams that help us keep water in the river. You can go, Senator Hanson-Young, up to New England and the Copeton Dam and see that, downstream of the Copeton Dam, there are no fish kills because we have a dam that is able to keep water in the river. Upstream of Copeton Dam there are fish kills because there are no dams. And guess what? The Greens are opposed to dams. They are opposed to them all. They don't want any of them. We have a regulated system and it is being managed well. It is the fact that sometimes during dry times we have no water for farmers and no water for rivers. That is the system. Right now, the Greens would have you believe there are farmers out there ripping water out of the basin. Where I am from, where Senator O'Sullivan is from and in northern New South Wales, they are having no water use at all. The system is being managed in accordance with the environmental factors we have. It is a much better system now thanks to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.</span>

As we have said today in debate on the bill that came before the Senate, the Morrison government, the Liberal-National government, understands that the fundamental priority of a Commonwealth government must be the security of Australia's borders. We make no excuses for that at all. When we came into office in 2013, we said we would put in place the right policies to ensure that we stopped the boats, we stopped the deaths at sea, we got the children out of detention and, ultimately, we were able to close the detention centres. That was a tough suite of policies. We put in place turnbacks, a policy that those on the other side said would never work. Well, guess what? Turnbacks have worked. We also have a fundamental commitment to offshore processing. That is something that, again, has been integral to the policies that we put into place. Of course the third part of the suite of policies was temporary protection visas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You need to be tough but fair when it comes to border protection in Australia. The policies that we have put in place have been successful. Why? Because, as Senator Hume knows, you do not blink when it comes to national security. You do not blink when it comes to securing Australia's borders. If you do, what do you see? Fifty thousand people arriving on over 800 boats, as with the border protection policy of the other side, and 1,200 deaths at sea that we know of. We will always maintain our resolve in relation to Australia's border security.</span>

Statements made by those on the other side and legislation that is now in place, supported by those on the other side—our intelligence agencies have been very, very clear—will absolutely give a clear signal to the people smugglers that, because of the actions of the Labor Party and Mr Bill Shorten, under a Labor government they will be back in business.</span>

The last time Labor were in government they sided with the Australian Greens in the Labor-Greens coalition and they dismantled the Howard government's strong border protection laws. In 2013 the people clearly voted for the Liberal-Nationals government to stop the people smuggling trade, and that is exactly what we did. In opposition the Labor Party have clearly indicated what they are prepared to do if they are ever elected to government. The legacy is there. We cannot afford to ever blink when it comes to border protection. (<span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span>)</span>

South Australia is reportedly set to receive $122 million from the $1.45 billion committed in January to mental health services, including funding for more mental health nurses and Indigenous mental health. South Australia suffers from chronic shortages from mental health nurses, particularly in regional and remote areas.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the safety of nurses in remote areas is especially important in my state, following the murder of a remote area nurse, Gayle Woodford, in March 2016. Gayle's death prompted national calls for the implementation of Gayle's law, which would see no remote area nurse being required to attend a call-out alone. As part of the government funding commitment, Primary Health Networks will be required to provide more job certainty through longer contracts. As well as job certainty, will the government ensure it is only funding services that provide safe working conditions for mental health nurses working in regional and remote areas?</span>

Remote health workforce safety has been a longstanding concern for government and employers of remote health workers. Remote area nurses manage a number of risks while providing vital health services in communities which often have none. Weather, travelling large distances and other complexities all come into play. Across the nation, there are more than 1,500 health professionals operating in rural and remote areas. It is a very different model of healthcare delivery and ensures essential health care is available to assist the most vulnerable parts of the community in the most isolated areas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were all incredibly saddened to hear of the murder of Gayle Woodford, who was, tragically, murdered when responding to a late-night request for help in 2016 in the APY Lands, for simply doing her job and caring for those in need. In response to this tragedy, our government provided nearly half a million dollars for immediate assistance to a suite of resources to help health professionals in remote locations and their employers. In the main in this area, it is state governments who are the employers of allied health professionals, in particular nurses in regional areas, and mitigate the risk to their personal safety and security as they go about their daily duties, which are fundamental to all of us. As I reported to the Senate in August last year, we also gave CRANAplus, the organisation that was tasked with rolling out those services, an additional $13.7 million to grow the type of work it was doing out in regional areas. I also requested at that time from COAG health ministers an update on Gayle's Law and inquired what work state governments were doing to ensure that their remote and rural health workforce was safe.</span>

It was passed by the South Australian parliament and received royal assent on 12 December 2017 but is not yet proclaimed. The act will come into operation on a day to be fixed by proclamation, and on that day the attendant regulations will be made. This is anticipated to occur during 2019.</span>

He has been a key component of developing the rural health strategy, our $550 million commitment at last year's budget that will see over the next decade an additional 3,000 doctors and 3,000 nurses practising out in rural, regional and remote areas. We know there are key areas that you need to focus on if you're developing a rural workforce to practise out in the regions. The greatest indicator are the trainees and those people from regional communities, because they're much more likely to return. They don't see it as a negative. Additionally, we aim to actually train them out in the regions. So part of our strategy as a federal government has been focused on training places in rural, regional and remote communities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But my question goes to it a different matter. Can the minister update the Senate on what the Liberal-National government is doing to keep Australians safe online and how these efforts are helping to ensure a safer Australia for everyone?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, we established the world's first Children's eSafety Commissioner, which is a dedicated statutory position with a clear mandate to improve community awareness of online safety risks for kids and to be a cop on the beat when it comes to cyberbullying. In 2016, we expanded the remit of the commissioner to cover online safety of all Australians, and this shift recognised that online safety issues are really a whole-of-community matter. This has extended the commissioner's reach to targeted programs and activities for older Australians, women and vulnerable groups. In 2018, we announced in the budget additional funding of $14.2 million to the office over four years to include resources to strengthen the e-safety office's IT and safeguard sensitive material, including child exploitation and intimate images. In 2018, the government announced an additional $17 million for the Keeping our Children Safe Online package, which is comprised of four distinct measures: the Early Years Online Safety program, an Online Safety Research program, an Online Safety Charter and a national online safety awareness campaign.</span>

The website, esafety.gov.au, includes advice for parents and ideas for approaching difficult conversations about sensitive matters. The government will also conduct an independent review of programs designed to develop and assess children's online safety skills, which I announced at the weekend, including digital licences in primary school. The idea of the digital licence for primary school kids is a bit like the old pen licence; it's something that parents and kids can prepare for at home and then present to their class. Students wouldn't have access to connected devices in class until they had completed that particular piece of work. It's something that parents universally have warmly welcomed.</span>

Is it the cut-off of childcare subsidies for those with incomes over $350,000? Is it the 50-year lease over the Malabar rifle range?

May I say on behalf of the government that we have thoroughly enjoyed working with him in advancing the public interest and making sure the Australian economy is as strong and successful as possible into the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, this is a somewhat unconventional question. It seems to be timed conspicuously around Senator Leyonhjelm's imminent departure! Some more will be said about that a bit later. The thing about Senator Leyonhjelm is that, compared with some others, it was always entirely predictable where he would come from. He was always against increasing taxes and in favour of cutting taxes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is, of course, why we were very grateful for his support in scrapping Labor's disastrous mining and carbon taxes. It's why we were very grateful when he and other key crossbenchers supported the government's business tax cuts to create more growth and more jobs. And of course there was our landmark personal income tax relief for the hardworking families across Australia. That is a package which legislated tax relief for 10 million working Australians. At its end, it will abolish an entire income tax bracket and ensure that 94 per cent of Australians pay no more than 32.5 per cent in the dollar in tax.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Leyonhjelm also joined us, along with the remainder of the Senate, in supporting the government's landmark GST reform bill for which we, from the great state of Western Australia, are very grateful indeed. Senator Leyonhjelm supported the government's budget repair effort. Indeed, he was one of the key supporters of our omnibus savings bill after the last election, for which we are very grateful.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than many in this place, he was aware of the need to balance the books, which is, of course, a reason why, along with the hard work of the government over the last 5½ years, we are able to deliver a surplus budget on 2 April. That is why we will be in a position to pay down the massive debts that Labor left behind. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In fact, by opening new markets for Australian exporters, our trade plan has helped create more than 200,000 jobs in trade related sectors.

I've been in this chamber now coming on 12 years, and one of the Greens' finest achievements was to help the Liberal-National Party defeat Labor's disastrous carbon pollution reduction scheme. In my time in this place I have not seen a finer moment of the Australian Greens than when they helped us pursue policy which protected the environment in a way that was economically responsible. Sadly, I think the Greens have somewhat lost their way since then. Sadly, the Greens these days are way too close to the Labor Party, and the Labor Party's way too close to the Greens. But it would not be accurate to say that there were no Greens achievements during my period here in this Senate. I've just pointed to one. On notice, I can perhaps think of some others. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In question time in the House of Representatives today, Minister Keenan repeated his assurance, previously given on three occasions, that neither he nor anyone in his office informed media outlets prior to the execution of the search warrant on the AWU offices. Mr Keenan's answers directly contradict evidence given under oath in court today by Minister Cash's former senior media adviser. Who is telling the truth: Minister Keenan or Minister Cash's former senior media adviser?</span>

It is not my job to assess these statements that are made in the Federal Court. Under the separation of powers under our parliamentary democracy, I will leave that to the relevant court.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:45</span>):  I thank Senator Molan for his question and his relentless focus on the things that enhance the lives and security of Australians, Australian businesses and our nation as a whole. Driving much of our nation's economic strength at present is the trade boom that Australia is enjoying. Just over the last couple of weeks we've seen ABS data released that shows that in 2018 Australia recorded our nation's highest ever trade surplus—a trade surplus of some $22.2 billion as part of a record high in two-way trade that Australia was engaging in. Indeed, 2018 was the first calendar year since 1972 in which each and every month of that year Australia recorded a trade surplus—the first year since 1972.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had 22 trade surpluses out of the last 24 months. What is driving this? Well, Australian businesses are driving it, but Australian businesses are driving it with their drive and ingenuity off the back of the export market opportunities the Liberal-National government has created. Our government has created an environment in which it is easier for Australian businesses to get into key growing markets, particularly the markets of North Asia—China, Japan and South Korea—and is, of course, expanding those opportunities through the Trans-Pacific Partnership as well—a deal, need I remind the Senate, that the Labor Party and Mr Shorten said was dead and that we should give up on. What we saw last year was strong growth across a whole range of different export commodities. There's diversity there. We saw rural goods growing by some 10 per cent in December alone, with a combined value of $20 billion, and services exports growing by 9.3 per cent in 2018 to $93 billion. All of this comes on top of our traditional areas of strength in mining and resources, driving jobs and opportunities for more Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Of course, all of those individual businesses are then inspired and have the opportunity to employ more Australians. There is more job security for those individual Australians and more opportunities in those rural communities. That's why we now see 2.2 million Australians employed because of these trade policy successes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:48</span>):  Australia has managed to strengthen its position, and I acknowledge that in a number of areas that's been bipartisan policy. Yes, the trade deals have usually been—in fact, nearly always—struck under our government. The Labor Party, in their previous six years in government, failed to commence and conclude a single trade agreement in that time. They have, by and large, cooperated, but what we saw late last year at Labor's national conference was a change in Labor policy—a change in Labor policy that will make it significantly harder for the Labor Party to do new deals in the future and even a threat that a future Labor government, if elected, would open up every trade agreement that we currently have and seek to try to renegotiate them. So just as Australia is at a time where our exports are at record highs and our trade successes at record levels, along comes the Labor Party threatening to undo that. Just as their tax policies are a threat to the economy, their trade policies are also a threat to the economy, and with that a threat to the jobs of Australians.</span>

                  </a>  Senator Collins has just reflected on Senator Cash in an inappropriate fashion. It is of course established fact also that Senator Cash will be appearing as a subpoenaed witness in that same court on Friday. The proposition that the executive government should be providing a running commentary of statements by individual witnesses is completely inappropriate. Like all relevant ministers, both stand by the statements they've made on the public record, and the Prime Minister has full confidence in his ministers.</span>

We know that our Pacific neighbours are family. That's why the Liberal-National government has announced a comprehensive set of initiatives to support the region's ongoing development, and those announcements are becoming a reality. Last month, Prime Minister Morrison became the first Australian Prime Minister to visit Fiji since 2006 and the first to visit Vanuatu since 1990, affirming their role in regional leadership. In Fiji we're elevating our relationship through the Fiji-Australia Vuvale partnership, which will be broad ranging and comprehensive, deepening our security, our economic and our people-to-people links. Last week, I was privileged to visit the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and, briefly, Vanuatu. I met leaders there to discuss progress in deepening our partnerships. I was able to turn the sod on two important initiatives—a new telecommunications cable landing point in Honiara and our new purpose-built high commission in Funafuti in Tuvalu. I officially opened our interim high commission while I was there.</span>

As the Prime Minister has said, we are strengthening our engagement with the Pacific for the Pacific's sake, because this is our home. This government has a comprehensive plan to step up our engagement in the Pacific, and we are delivering. Working closely with the assistant minister, Senator Ruston, with the Prime Minister and with myself, we are delivering.</span>

We're also working together to address the Pacific's unique security interests—including those from environmental challenges and those from transnational crime, both human and cybersecurity issues—because we know that a strong and stable region keeps us more secure. It enables our economies to grow and our peoples to prosper. In partnership with Fiji we've begun the redevelopment of the Blackrock peacekeeping facility with Prime Minister Morrison and the new Fijian Foreign Minister Seruiratu, turning the first sod last month.</span>

We have shared history, interests and understanding. That's why we are investing in a number of projects to strengthen those common bonds, including, particularly, in sport, which often lies at the heart of Australia's engagement with the Pacific. It brings people, communities and countries together. In fact, I was just discussing this with the Nauruan finance minister, David Adeang, this morning. His record-breaking powerlifting feats in the sports complex that I opened at the Pacific Islands Forum last year are the stuff of legend. Under our Australia-Pacific sports linkages program, we have preparations underway for a Young Matildas tour of the Pacific this year, preparations for preseason NRL games in the Pacific from 2021, support for a Fiji team in the New South Wales Rugby League Intrust Super Premiership and support for Netball Australia to assist the Fijian national team prepare for the netball World Cup. So there is much effort in that area. Our church partnerships program is also forging ahead. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

After its voting against a royal commission 26 times and former Prime Minister Turnbull's conceding that the government delayed it by 18 months, the government now refuses to recall the parliament to ensure urgent changes to laws in response to the royal commission. Unlike the government, Labor is committed to ensuring the banks know that if they do the wrong thing they will pay the price. Why didn't the government join with Labor to increase jail time for the most serious corporate crimes from 10 years to 15 years imprisonment and to double the proposed cap on financial penalties to half a billion dollars?</span>

We will be going through the appropriate process to ensure that there are no unintended consequences. We are still waiting for Labor's position on the banking royal commission. Other than weasel words about in-principle support for the 76 recommendations, we haven't actually had a specific position. In fact, when shadow Treasurer Bowen was asked about how they would deal with various things, he pointed out that they would have to go through proper processes to make relevant decisions. To recall the parliament to deal with legislation that is yet to be drafted is not a responsible use of taxpayer resources and it is not something the government is proposing to do; but, of course, we continue to take strong action to ensure customers around Australia are protected. </span>

We are taking action on all 76 recommendations, but 40 of the 76 recommendations do require the drafting of complex legislation. In order to do that in a proper, orderly and competent fashion, it will involve some engagement with relevant stakeholders. There is no circumstance in which, over the next few weeks, we could sensibly pass legislation to deal with those 40 recommendations, and that is why we are prioritising our actions. We are taking strong action. I have listed some of the measures that we have already taken and are taking in my response to the primary question. We are just getting on with the job, whereas the Labor Party continue to focus on ancient history.</span>

If the Labor Party hadn't wasted so much time this week in trying to weaken our borders—in fact, weakening our borders—we would have made much more progress with the legislation in front of us. All I know is that, as I look at senators across the chamber, I am sure that they are praying and praying that the parliament is not recalled, all the while making the political argument in the public domain to score some political points. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That really says it all. This is a nonsense from this government. They just try and use fear campaigns to divide the community and shore up their rabble of a government and their declining capacity to get things through this Senate and through the House of Representatives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Cash, a cabinet minister, has been anything but forthright in this parliament. She misled parliament on five occasions. She skulked and hid behind a whiteboard to try and avoid being pulled up on what she was doing. She has hidden behind public interest immunity to not answer questions on her involvement in the leaking of information to the press that the AFP said could have put their people's lives in danger. This is a disgraced minister, a disgraceful government and a government that is full of machinations and full of fear campaigns but don't look after the best interests of people in this country. This is a minister who should really start considering her position. She should just resign. And if she won't resign, then Mr Morrison should sack her. Here we have, day after day now, evidence coming out in court, under oath, that contradicts what Minister Cash has been telling this parliament. We now know that Minister Keenan's office was involved. Isn't it funny that we've got the Leader of the Senate, Western Australian; Minister Cash, Western Australian and Mr Keenan, Western Australian, all in there defending each other on what is basically a smear campaign on the Leader of the Opposition and a fear campaign to try and shore up their failing government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Wong simply asked had Mr Morrison sought reassurance on the statements by Senator Cash and Mr Keenan? We couldn't get an answer on that either. Wouldn't you think that even though he may only be a temporary Prime Minister, he should at least be seeking some reassurance about what's been happening in the courts against what these ministers have said in this place and have said publicly? There is absolutely no doubt that this minister, Minister Cash's office, engaged in what is basically criminal activity. This is a minister who presided over the ABCC when the commissioner of the ABCC had to resign in ignominy. It's about time Senator Cash resigned in ignominy as well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There's one fear and smear campaign, in this chamber and in other venues of this parliament, that's been going on for quite a while now, and that's the relentless attacks on an absolutely fine minister from Western Australia, the outstanding Senator Cash—someone who has done an absolutely outstanding job in this government over a long period of time. Senator Cameron continues to roll the same questions out over and over again no matter how clearly Minister Cash has answered them in repeated forums, in estimates, over and over again. The obfuscation and misleading questions coming from those opposite just continue to be rolled out.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's put a few facts on the table as to what this issue is actually about. This is all about the proper authorisation of donations made by the AWU and—surprise, surprise!—those opposite running a protection racket for the union movement yet again, as we see in this place constantly. What are those donations? A hundred thousand dollars to GetUp!, $25,000 to Mr Shorten's election campaign and other donations made by the AWU to various Labor Party election campaigns. There has been a refusal to provide documentation to the Registered Organisations Commission to show that the donations were properly authorised. Why is that such a big ask? Why is it such a big ask to show that donations were properly authorised, that the correct procedures were followed, when these very significant donations were made to GetUp! and to the Labor Party? That question won't be answered by those opposite. The refusal to provide this documentation dates back to August 2017—August 2017; we're in February 2019—when revelations about those donations were first raised by the media.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was ROC, the Registered Organisations Commission, that made the decision to investigate these donations, and that has been made very clear at numerous rounds of estimates. What has also been made very clear at numerous rounds of estimates is that the AWU, the union, has expressly declined to provide documentation requested of it by ROC. The questions raised by those opposite are about the AWU trying to have a court prevent the Registered Organisations Commission investigating whether the donations were properly authorised or having access to documents seized by the Australian Federal Police in relation to the ROC's investigation. This is a legitimate investigation into very large political donations. We've heard a lot about political donations in this place over the last few years, a lot of fire and thunder and outrage, but this was $100,000 to GetUp!—$100,000 to an organisation that is specifically targeting members of parliament to try to have them unseated. This is a significant issue in our democracy. Those opposite, in protecting their union mates, protecting the union movement—running a protection racket—are attacking Minister Cash, attacking ministers in the other place and casting smear and innuendo towards them, when these questions have been repeatedly asked and repeatedly answered over a series of estimates hearings, some of which I've been at in my capacity as Chair of the Education and Employment Legislation Committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my remaining few seconds I would ask a question of those Australians listening today. We've just had a series of events in Australia that you'd think those opposite would like to ask some questions about. We've had significant floods in Queensland and significant fires in Tasmania and other places—events that have cast a shadow over communities across Australia. We've had Labor voting to weaken our border protection. And what do they want to ask questions about? They want to ask questions about Minister Cash. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  Well, isn't the scandal involving Senator Cash just unravelling more and more and more? This is a scandal that has gone on for 18 months now, and, just when Senator Cash thought that she was through the worst of it, that she'd be able to put a big whiteboard up in front of herself and skate through until the election, the truth is finally coming out in the Federal Court of Australia as we speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last two days we have heard extraordinary evidence from the former senior media adviser to Senator Cash, who infamously had to resign after his leaking of confidential police information was exposed through media reports and Senate estimates about 18 months ago. Now, in legal proceedings before the Federal Court brought by the Australian Workers' Union over this illegal raid, we have heard damning evidence from the former senior media adviser to Senator Cash about what he and his colleagues from this government were up to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary: over the last couple of days what we have learnt in evidence given under oath, with risk of perjury charges if it's not true, from the former senior media adviser to Senator Cash is that initially he didn't want to answer questions about who was involved in this leak because he was concerned that he would incriminate himself. An admission of guilt if ever I've heard one. Then, when forced, he identified Senator Cash's former chief of staff as the source of the information which he then leaked. For many months now we have heard from Senator Cash and other members of this government that it was only her former senior media adviser involved in this—it was only one rogue; it was only one bad apple who was out there involved in this leak. Well, now we know, as a result of this evidence in court, that it involved two former staff members of Senator Cash. And not just two junior staff members; her former senior media adviser and her former chief of staff were in on this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence got even more extraordinary today in the court when we learnt from the evidence of the former senior media adviser that part of his motivation in leaking this information was to damage the reputation of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten. What we've all known on this side of the chamber for some time now has now been spilt out into open court: this confidential information about a police raid was leaked to the media for political purposes, to damage the reputation of the opposition leader.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I remembered evidence we received from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police after this leak. He was extremely unhappy about the leak having occurred. He said that he always hates leaks about police information because it puts the lives of his police officers in danger. What we now know is that the former senior media adviser to Senator Cash was prepared to leak information about a police raid to the media and thereby put police lives in danger only to damage the reputation of the Leader of the Opposition. This is the kind of behaviour you expect in a banana republic. This is the kind of behaviour you expect in some sort of dictatorship, not in the country of Australia. But, unfortunately, that's where things have got to under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the other evidence we saw in court today was where the former senior media adviser to Senator Cash admitted that it wasn't only her former chief of staff who was in on this; it actually crossed over different ministerial offices. He talked about this, and conspired to leak this information to the media with the former senior media adviser in the office of the then Minister for Justice, Mr Keenan. This involved not only two staff members of Senator Cash but also a second ministerial office, and who knows what else we're going to find out by the time the day is out let alone by the time we get to the evidence from Senator Cash on Friday. This new evidence goes directly against what Mr Keenan told the House of Representatives, where he claimed that no-one from his office was involved in this raid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen again today a complete unwillingness from Senator Cash and Senator Cormann to answer questions about this scandal. Initially, they said they didn't know. Senator Cash said she didn't know about this evidence in court, just like she conveniently didn't know about the leak in the first place—I don't think anyone believes that. Then they tried to write off this evidence: 'Oh, it's just evidence given to a court.' Well, it's actually evidence given under oath with the risk of perjury charges. The government knows how serious this is, and it's only going to get worse.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  It is always a pleasure to join my colleagues in taking note of answers provided by ministers. It was very telling to listen to Senator Cameron's contribution at the beginning of this debate, when he rattled off a list of things that weren't being talked about in question time—health and education. It is a bit rich coming from Senator Cameron, when those opposite spent the entirety of question time trying to change the channel on the disastrous border protection policy they, in cahoots with the Greens, rammed through this place—the weakening of the border protection policies that this country has. In this business, this is what happens: political parties, in this case the Labor Party, that have done something they are not proud of—weakened our borders in this country—want to distract. They want to change the channel and change the debate. That is what they're doing here. They're doing a 'look over here': 'Everyone look. Here's something else to look at.' Of course, it is not something of interest to the Australian public. It is an 'inside the Canberra bubble' type matter. It is something I think the opposition should take note of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an election coming down the train line, and we should be looking at things that actually matter to the Australian people, and not worrying about the Leader of the Opposition's reputation, as you clearly are—although I would argue that he himself has done enough damage to that, and through the royal commission as well. Listening to the contributions that have been made to this debate, and also listening to the questions and the motivations behind the questions asked by opposition senators, I had to ask myself why. I have already canvassed the idea that the Labor Party is trying to escape the reality of their appalling decision to undermine border security. I think it's fairly clear that that's what they are up to here. But why are they going after a very competent and well-regarded minister? It is because Senator Cash is one who has pointed out, repeatedly, question time after question time, some of the most disgusting examples of abuse of workers' rights undertaken by unions in this country—things that were revealed by the royal commission. It might amuse some senators, but they are serious matters. We only have to look at some of the things that were publicised through the royal commission. The response from the opposition is to attack, in the best way they can, to try to take down a minister who is actually highlighting to Australians things they need to know: the antics of unions in this country that needed to be dealt with. We only have to look at some of the things that came out of the Heydon royal commission. I refer to comments that Senator Cash made after the conclusion of the royal commission around things that were found. She said that the Heydon Royal Commission found that Bill Shorten, as secretary of the Australian Workers Union, arranged payments from numerous businesses to benefit the union rather than its members. Senator Cash further said, 'As secretary of the AWU, Bill Shorten'—the Leader of the Opposition—'traded away the pay and conditions of some of Australia's lowest paid workers. The AWU'—the union of which the Leader of the Opposition was secretary'—later received secret payments of $75,000 from Cleanevent'—a company that was in talks with Mr Shorten—'to maintain this arrangement. In addition, when Bill Shorten ran for parliament in 2007, a building company spent $32,000 hiring a staff member to act as his campaign manager whilst at the same time negotiating an enterprise agreement with Mr Shorten's union. These payments created a clear conflict of interest and were highly unethical.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the things that Senator Cash has been highlighting all along—things that Australians need to know about. In response, instead of talking about issues that matter to Australians, such as—as Senator Cameron almost gallingly pointed out—health, education and indeed the Labor Party's terrible efforts at undermining border security in this country, we're talking about assassinating the character of a minister in this government. Let's forget about the fact that this matter is before the courts and that, as Senator Cormann, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, pointed out, there is a separation of powers. We are senators. We are not judges in court, yet the opposition seem to think they can do a much better job than Federal Court judges. They actually think that they can dictate what comes here and what justice is served in their eyes. Well, leave it to the courts. Do the right thing and perhaps start outlining a proper agenda ahead of the election, like what you are doing in response to the banking royal commission, rather than hiding behind your weasel words from Mr Bowen. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="LNW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KENEALLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  I rise to take part in the debate in response to questions by Senator Cameron and Senator Wong. We are having this debate because today in the court we heard David De Garis, the former media adviser to Senator Michaelia Cash, give evidence and admit that reputational impact against Mr Shorten was part of his motivation for giving media a tip ahead of the raids at the AWU headquarters in Melbourne and Sydney in October 2017. We are here today asking questions of Minister Cash. We are here today having this debate because Minister Cash is refusing to answer questions. She is refusing to answer questions such as, for example: how does this align with her obligation under the Statement of Ministerial Standards to act through the lawful and disinterested exercise of the statutory and other powers available to her office? We are here today because the best that Minister Cormann can give us is a statement that the government maintains confidence in all its ministers. We are not hearing from Minister Cash or Minister Cormann direct answers on the circumstances around these AWU raids and the role that the minister and her staff may have played.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is part of the ongoing campaign of fear and smear run by the government. This government is so devoid of vision, plans, reforms and a look at what Australia might look like over the next five years that all it can talk about is fear and smear—whipping up fear and scaring people, instead of giving them a vision for the future. For example, we heard the Prime Minister this week at the National Press Club. Here's what he didn't talk about. He didn't talk about schools. He didn't talk about hospitals. He didn't talk about Medicare. He didn't talk about child care. He didn't talk about the NBN. He didn't talk about climate change. He just tried to scare people with a dark vision of the future. That's all he has to offer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what else he didn't talk about. He didn't talk about the fact that wages growth is the slowest on record. He didn't talk about the fact that company profits are growing at six times the rate of wages. He did not talk about the record-high gross debt. He didn't talk about the fact that 1.8 million Australians are looking for work or are looking for more work. He certainly did not talk about the fact that childcare costs are up 24 per cent, that power bills are up 15 per cent and that private healthcare costs are up 30 per cent. All we have from the government, instead of talking about, as Senator Duniam so eloquently puts it, things that matter to Australians, like schools, hospitals, Medicare, child care, the NBN and climate change, all the Prime Minister can offer us is whipping up of fear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wasn't he whipping up fear earlier today in his media conference? Wasn't he laying out the welcome mat for the people smugglers? Wasn't he just tempting those boats to start again? The Prime Minister of this country went out there and announced to the world that he is reopening a hotel for people smugglers on Christmas Island. Understand this: there is one person in Australia who wants the boats to start again and that is the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. He is out there tempting them, goading them. He is hoping that those boats come again, because he knows there is nothing that passed the parliament today that would restart the boats. That is the fact, and the Prime Minister knows it. But, instead of dealing with those facts, the Prime Minister has gone out on a campaign of fear and a campaign of smear, trying to whip up hysteria, trying to fearmonger and hoping the boats start again. He knows that it is turnbacks, offshore processing and regional processing that has stopped the boats and that nothing that passed the parliament today will restart the boats. What will do it is his rhetoric and the invitation of the opening up of a hotel on Christmas Island. That's what the Prime Minister is doing, and he is tempting those boats to start again. We see from Minister Cash fear and smear against Labor leader Bill Shorten. We see from this government fear and smear about the dark days ahead. But we do not see a positive vision for the future of this country.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia (Senator Canavan) to a question without notice asked by Senator Hanson-Young today relating to the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My questions to him were of course in his capacity representing the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, a minister who has done absolutely nothing, despite our river system, our nation's largest river system, being on the brink of collapse. Over the summer, while this place was on holidays, communities right throughout the Murray-Darling Basin were suffering. We know that millions of fish died on the lower Darling. We know the environment has been in collapse ever since, and we know that the only solution that this government has offered is that Australians all get together and pray for rain. What an absolute disgrace. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we should be getting on with responding to the recommendations from the South Australian royal commission, handed down a week or so ago, and to the concerns and recommendations of the government's own Productivity Commission report—two reports that were scathing about the government's management of the Murray-Darling Basin and the their inability to deliver on the outcomes of protecting and saving the environment—$13 billion of Australian taxpayers' money has been put on the table. This funding was designed—we were told, we were promised—to save the river system from collapse, but the exact opposite has occurred. If that does not warrant a reasonable response from the minister of the day and this government, what does? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirteen billion dollars and we've got a million dead fish. Thirteen billion dollars and the river is dying. Thirteen billion dollars and there's not enough water to save the environment. That is what both the Productivity Commission has said and the South Australian royal commission has said. This is squarely at the feet of this government. We know that, when this government came into power, Barnaby Joyce was given the water portfolio because a deal was done between the Liberal Party and the Nationals that the Nationals had to be given the water portfolio. It's like putting the fox in charge of the hen house. If you want to ruin a river system, if you want to condemn the environment to death, you give the Nationals the keys to the water portfolio. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This National Party has overseen the death of the Murray-Darling. It is condemning river communities to suffering and destitution. The National Party has sold out the Australian taxpayer. Instead of spending $13 billion fixing the river, we've seen hundreds of millions and billions of dollars going to line the pockets of the mates of the National Party. Barnaby Joyce, former water minister, has done very well for his cotton grower mates in Queensland, his big corporate cotton grower mates, and very little to save the river. It is on the head of Barnaby Joyce and the rest of the National Party that this river is dying a slow, painful death. It is on the heads of the National Party ministers that a million fish are dead this summer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do we hear from the government today? Absolutely nothing. They've dismissed the very real legal concerns of lawyers across this country who have looked at the details of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. They have dismissed the evidence of corruption, of water theft, of mismanagement. They're doing everything they can to cover up this scandal because they know it is just so bad; it is rotten right to the core. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You want to know why we've got a million dead fish in this country in the lower Darling? It's because of Barnaby Joyce and the National Party. Rather than fixing the problem, rather than doing anything about it, we've got the Prime Minister and his water minister telling Australians to 'go pray for rain'. It is pathetic. This is why we need a royal commission into the management of the Murray-Darling Basin, because it's $13 billion and no-one can point to where the water is. It's $13 billion, and some big greedy corporate irrigators are getting pretty rich and the river is dying a slow, painful death. It's a scandal that needs to be tackled.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 (the Act) to enable mutual and cooperative firms, particularly the mutually-owned financial institutions, to raise the capital they need to compete with investor-owned banks, insurers and other competitors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cooperatives, mutuals and member-owned firms have a proud history across the country, providing generations of Australians with customer and community-focused alternatives to profit‑driven businesses. The oldest member-owned firms even pre‑date the Commonwealth, with some tracing histories that extend back to decades before Australia's Federation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over their long history, member-owned firms have been operating reliably and consistently across many industries including agriculture, banking and finance, housing, insurance and retail. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over 14 million people, nearly 2 in 3 Australians, were members of these organisations in 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yet despite their value to customers and the community, mutuals and cooperatives in Australia have long been underappreciated and ignored by our federal laws. They face a number of barriers preventing them from growing to their full potential, placing them at a disadvantage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill represents the outcome of a long and comprehensive process to identify and address the regulatory impediments facing the mutuals sector, starting with the Senate Economics References Committee report on Cooperative, Mutual and Member-owned Firms in 2015. This report highlighted the impediments to competition and consumer choice, caused by uncertainty and a lack of capital raising options for mutual and cooperative firms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recognising that our federal laws were effectively forcing mutuals and cooperatives to compete with one arm tied behind their back, in 2017 the then Treasurer, Scott Morrison, commissioned Mr Greg Hammond to advise the Government on regulatory and legislative changes that could remove the barriers facing the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government accepted all 11 of the Hammond Report recommendations and we have been working with the mutuals sector, the legal community and regulators to develop this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has consulted with the Legislative and Governance Forum on Corporations in relation to the Bill, which has approved them as required under the Corporations Agreement 2002.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a credit to the Prime Minister who, as Treasurer, pushed these reforms forward and he deserves to be acknowledged as these reforms now come before the Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will introduce a definition of a mutual entity into the Corporations Act for the first time. It will remove the uncertainty around demutualisation provisions and disclosure requirements that have prevented mutual Authorised deposit-taking Institutions, otherwise known as "mutual banks", from raising capital in the past, and it will create a new type of bespoke instrument, called a Mutual Capital Instrument, which allows mutuals to raise equity through a specialised capital instrument. The Bill also provides a simple, standardised process for mutuals to amend their constitutions to take advantage of the introduction of Mutual Capital Instruments, should they wish to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With this legislation, the Government will finally ensure that cooperatives and mutuals are recognised in our federal laws. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our reforms will mean more opportunities for mutual organisations by allowing them to raise the funds they need to make long-term investments for the benefit of their members, and to compete effectively with shareholder-owned companies for the benefit of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has been working assiduously to protect and promote our market access and other trade interests with the UK and EU, in the lead up to Brexit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This extends to the wine industry, where the Australian Government must provide certainty, as market and vintage planning arrangements can be made years in advance before a product is available and ready for export. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The UK is Australia's top wine export market by volume and third largest market by value. It is therefore vital we ensure the continuity of trade with the UK regardless of their Brexit arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Trade in wine between Australia and the UK is currently facilitated by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Agreement between Australia and the European Community on Trade in Wine</span>. This Agreement is given effect in Australian law by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wine Australia Act 2013</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement envisages a Brexit transition period, during which, obligations stemming from EU-third country agreements will continue to apply to the UK. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill introduces amendments to the Wine Australia Act to ensure that Australia's wine trade with the UK continues to be covered by the Act during any Brexit transition period, consistent with the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement. Specifically, the Bill will amend the definition of 'EC country' in the Act to include the UK, during a Brexit Transition Period. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also this week tabling the <span style="font-style:italic;">Agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom on Trade in Wine</span>, which was signed between Australia and the UK in London last month. This new wine trade Agreement with the UK is part of our preparations for a 'no deal' Brexit, whereby the UK leaves the EU without a transition period or other measures in place. In the event of deal or no-deal Brexit, the combined efforts of this legislative amendment and our new Agreement with the UK will ensure that our wine industry can continue to export to the UK, post-Brexit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These measures will ensure the continued facilitation of trade in wine between Australia and the UK and a mutually beneficial trade relationship, whatever shape Brexit takes. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL 2019</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The enactment of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act 2018 </span>in December 2018 was a critical step to combat terrorists and serious criminals using digital technology to hide their illegal activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's law enforcement and national security agencies are now equipped with the tools they need to keep Australians safe, while operating in an increasingly complex modern communications environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Assistance and Access Act established a framework for national security and law enforcement agencies to seek assistance from the communications industry — to support investigations and operations that would otherwise be delayed or stymied by suspects' use of encrypted communications. The legislation also introduced new computer access powers to ensure that our agencies can access lawfully obtained content and data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is keenly aware that the legitimate use of encryption keeps the data of all Australians safe and secure when they interact with digital platforms. Maintaining the security of networks and devices is paramount to ensuring Australians can harness the potential of modern technology. I reiterate the words of the Attorney-General in his <span style="font-style:italic;">second reading speech</span> on the then Assistance and Access Bill — the legislation prohibits the creation of so-called back doors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Commissions are empowered to use the industry assistance measures. This The legislation does not allow for mass surveillance. Access to personal information must be authorised by existing warrants and authorisations, which are subject to their own safeguards, including judicial oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Assistance and Access Act itself contains important safeguard and oversight measures to protect the privacy of Australians, maintain the security of the digital ecosystem and ensure powers are exercised responsibly. A key purpose of the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2019 is to further strengthen these oversight mechanisms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010 </span>to bring forward the review of the Assistance and Access Act by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor — to provide timely assurance that the Assistance and Access Act is operating as intended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Assistance and Access Act already requires the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of the Act. The Bill expedites the timeframes for this review — so that it will be finished before the end of, rather than after, the 18-month period beginning on 8 December 2018 when the Act received Royal Assent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Bringing forward the review by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor will bolster the effective, timely and expert monitoring of the Assistance and Access Act — to make sure this framework is working and is striking the right balance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Aside from bringing forward the timing, this amendment does not change the purpose and nature of the review by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telecommunications Act 1997 </span>to ensure Commonwealth and State anti-corruption bodies and Investigative Commissions are empowered to use the industry assistance measures. This will help these bodies identify and investigate serious crime, and law enforcement misconduct and corruption across the public sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Commonwealth and State anti-corruption bodies and Investigative Commissions were included in the original Assistance and Access Bill that was introduced into the House on 20 September 2018. These agencies were, however, subsequently excluded from the scope of the industry assistance measures in accordance with a recommendation from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS). The exclusion of these bodies was recommended as an interim measure while the Committee continued its consideration of the Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Chair of the PJCIS informed the House yesterday that it is now the consensus view of the Committee that the Act be extended to these agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Anti-corruption agencies and Investigative Commissions have an important oversight function and typically have access to intrusive powers, like interception warrants and telecommunications. The use of interception and surveillance powers has enabled these bodies to collect vital, and often powerful evidence. However, similar to the experience of interception agencies, the evolving technological environment has created challenges for anti-corruption bodies and investigative commissions. Increasingly, their capacity to rely on these important tools is being undermined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A joint submission from the Commissioners of eight State anti-corruption and Crime Commissions plus the Commissioner of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to the PJCIS' Inquiry into the Act has called for the urgent extension of the Act's industry assistance measures to these agencies. The Commissioners note that these powers are crucial in their fight against organised crime and corruption. Their argument for the need for these powers is compelling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Access to the industry assistance measures will ensure anti-corruption bodies and investigative commissions can overcome the issues caused by technologies such as encryption. Specifically, anti-corruption bodies and investigative commissions will be empowered to obtain legitimate and necessary assistance from domestic and international communications providers in accordance with the existing safeguards and limitations in Part 15 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Telecommunications Act 1997. </span>Importantly, the use of the industry assistance powers remains subject to oversight from the Commonwealth Ombudsman.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill ensures that anti-corruption bodies and investigative commissions are able continue to fulfil their function and have access to the same powers as the law enforcement and national security agencies that they oversee. The Bill does not provide anti-corruption bodies and investigative commissions with unfettered powers. Indeed, these bodies will be included within a framework that is currently operating and is subject to strong safeguards and oversight measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is vital that such national security legislation is supported by appropriate safeguards and oversight measures. This Bill enhances the already strong measures in the Assistance and Access Act to ensure the powers are proportionate to the threats they are designed to counter, that these powers are used appropriately, and that the privacy and data security of innocent Australians is preserved. Importantly, the Bill also increases the accountability of those public officers that Australians entrust to keep them safe and secure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</span>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill gives back some power to the people. It seeks to give consumers and voters more control over unsolicited electronic and telephone communication from political parties and registered charities, which currently enjoy broad exemptions from laws that otherwise prohibit or limit telemarketing calls and spam messages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This problem was highlighted most recently when Mr Clive Palmer spammed voters nationally with SMS messages, prompting hundreds of complaints to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not the first time this is happened and, unless the measures in this bill pass, it will not be the last. We know voters are unhappy about receiving these SMS messages, but ACMA is largely powerless to act on these complaints. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill seeks to address this situation, and to do so in a way that strikes a balance between the rights of consumers and the implied freedom of political communication protected by the Constitution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Spam Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;">2003 </span>to require that any electronic electoral message – essentially messages designed to influence voters in a federal election - must include an unsubscribe function. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a simple yet effective means of managing this type of mass unwanted texts from political parties and candidates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the provisions of the bill, each electronic electoral message needs to make a clear statement advising the recipient that they can unsubscribe from further electronic communications and provide an electronic link to do so. The unsubscribe link must be functional, and able to handle a reasonable amount of traffic at all times of the day for at least 30 days after the message is sent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Including an unsubscribe function in these messages allows voters to control whether they wish to continue receiving these messages, based on whether the message, party or candidate is of interest to them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It would also mean ACMA would not bear the brunt of voter discontent over unsolicited political texts, and it could ideally deploy the resources it uses on these complaints to other productive work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Should parties or candidates get an unsubscribe request, they can feasibly send one last message acknowledging the request and providing a subscribe link in the event the voter changes their mind down the track. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill also seeks to ensure more honest telephone campaigning during elections, by ensuring that the use of actors in voice calls is disclosed at the outset. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</span> to require actors performing in electoral voice calls to be identified as actors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unless the use of actors in political propaganda and messaging is properly disclosed, there is always a risk that the actors can be misrepresented as real people, or mistaken by voters as real people, and that their stories and experiences may be taken as genuine rather than illustrative or manufactured to make a point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Frankly, if a political party can't persuade voters of the merits of their argument without relying on pretence, then their argument has no real merit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And finally, this bill will also seek to give consumers some control over unsolicited and unwanted calls from registered charities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Do Not Call Register Act 2006</span>, Australian numbers registered on the Do Not Call Register may receive telemarketing calls from registered charities, among others, and consumers have little recourse should they wish to "opt out" of these.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We all recognise and value the work of charities. However, we also know from news reports and consumer advocates that charity telemarketing calls can become a nuisance, and worse, for some vulnerable consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A 2017 survey published by ACMA, <span style="font-style:italic;">Telemarketing calls in Australia: Consumer experience research</span>, found cold calls from charities were the most common type of telemarketing call received on landlines, and that almost half of all those surveyed found telemarketing calls from charities to be "a problem". </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Another survey, conducted by consumer advocate CHOICE in 2016, found charities to be the main source of unwanted calls. Its <span style="font-style:italic;">Who</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s on the Line</span> report found about 25% of respondents received calls from a charity to their landline at least weekly, and 20% received them to their mobile. About 5% reported receiving daily calls. This was despite some respondents saying they had made repeated requests to be taken off contact lists. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The survey also found 74% of respondents thought charities should not be allowed to call numbers on the register, and 88% agreed with the statement, "I wish there was more I could do to stop these unsolicited calls".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These nuisance calls impacted their view of the charity and their desire to donate in future, and some respondents also expressed concern over the sometimes heavy-handed and emotionally manipulative tactics of telemarketers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The UK experienced the worst of this in 2015, when 92-year-old Olive Cooke took her own life in part because of the distress caused by the avalanche of cold calls she received and letters requesting donations – reportedly up to 3000 letters in a year - from charities and their authorised marketing agencies who shared her contact details between them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A UK review of fundraising self-regulation released that year, chaired by Sir Stuart Etherington, touched on Ms Cooke's death, and made recommendations including the creation of a new regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Regulating Fundraising for the Future</span> report succinctly stated: "…we are clear that charities and voluntary organisations must be allowed to raise funds from the public. We are equally clear that this right to ask is not unbounded. For the public, the right to be left alone, or approached with respect and humility, is equally strong. This is not simply a matter of public interest, but is also key to the long-term sustainability of charities".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The UK now has a Fundraising Preference Service, operated by the new Fundraising Regulator, which allows members of the public to opt out of communications from their specified charities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill proposes a simpler solution than that: allowing consumers on the Do Not Call Register to opt out of receiving any telemarketing call made on behalf of a registered charity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not the intent of the bill to curtail the important work of registered charities or make it difficult to fundraise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As of June 2016, the Do Not Call Register had 10.65 million registered Australian numbers and it is envisaged the vast majority of numbers would remain as <span style="font-style:italic;">charity-contactable numbers</span>, as defined in the bill.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>This is because the bill requires consumers to take action to 'opt out' of receiving telemarketing calls from charities - as opposed to making them 'opt in' to receiving calls – and it is expected that only those consumers who are particularly distressed or annoyed by charity telemarketing calls would be motivated to take that action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill does not contain a similar opt out provision for political parties and candidates because the public is much more comfortable - happy even - hanging up on these calls than they are about terminating a call made on behalf of a charity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I believe the provisions set out in this bill are measured, responsible and responsive. These amendments will give people a more satisfactory level of control over unwanted calls and texts without unduly interfering with the operations of political entities and charities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Export Control Amendment (Banning Cotton Exports to Ensure Water Security) Bill 2019 is a necessary response to the failure of the Australian Government, and the Governments of New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, to respond positively to the findings and recommendations of the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Regrettably, it is necessary to open debate on an unpalatable measure that may ultimately prove necessary to protect and restore the environmental health of Australia's biggest and most vital river system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In his report, released on 31 January 2019, Commissioner Bret Walker SC delivered a damning indictment of water and environmental management under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and recommended a complete overhaul of the scheme, specifically to reallocate much more water from irrigation to the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Royal Commission found the Murray-Darling Basin plan ignored potentially "catastrophic" risks of climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commissioner found that Commonwealth officials have committed gross maladministration, negligence and unlawful actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Murray-Darling Basin Authority has repeatedly pushed aside and suppressed good science while the defence of sectional interests has prevailed over the health of our major river system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Perhaps most importantly, the Commissioner found that the so-called "triple bottom line" approach, in which economic and social factors are considered to reduce the water recovery target for the environment, is fatally flawed, and at odds with provisions of the Commonwealth<span style="font-style:italic;"> Water Act 2007</span> which requires that Basin water resources be managed "in the national interest" and, inter alia, " to protect, restore and provide for the ecological values and ecosystem services of the Murray-Darling Basin". </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Large scale water buybacks, and a consequent reduction in irrigation – especially in the northern Murray-Darling Basin – are essential to restore the environmental health of the river system and ensure water security for cities, towns and communities downstream. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It should be recalled that the Royal Commission was prompted by allegations of massive water theft by New South Wales' irrigators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Royal Commission proceeded with its work in the face of conspicuous non-cooperation from the Australian Government, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and from the New South Wales and Queensland Governments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Meanwhile drought has gripped the Murray-Darling Basin. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Rivers have stopped flowing in north-west New South Wales, leaving some towns on severe water restrictions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Major fish kills in New South Wales, including two on an extraordinary scale at Menindee, have resulted in hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of fish dying. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Against this background, it is remarkable that the Royal Commission's report has been met with government reactions ranging from indifference to outright hostility. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The New South Wales and Queensland Governments have effectively rejected the report and its recommendations out of hand. The Australian Government appears indifferent, while the South Australian Government's response has been low-key to the point of timidity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In these circumstances, in which there is no political movement to embrace the Royal Commission's report, it is necessary to consider other measures to protect and restore the environmental health of the Murray-Darling Basin. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In this the role of cotton production in the Murray-Darling Basin cannot be ignored. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The overwhelming majority of Australian cotton is grown in the Murray-Darling Basin with some 90 per cent exported, mainly to China and India. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a highly successful industry, but one that imposes a major drain on the water resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 21.4 per cent of Murray-Darling Basin irrigation water was used in cotton production in 2005-06. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2008-09, the ABS reported that cotton accounted for the highest proportion of irrigation water used in the Murray-Darling Basin – 23 per cent, exceeding that used for cereal crops – 20 per cent – and for pasture for grazing – 15 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For 2010-11, the ABS further reported that: </span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The largest volume of irrigation water was applied to cotton, which used 1,882 gigalitres, or 28 per cent of the national irrigation total for the year (6,645 gigalitres).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">In the Murray-Darling Basin, cotton accounted for the largest area of irrigated land, with 332,000 hectares, or 28 per cent of the total irrigated land in the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Cotton also used the largest volume of irrigation water in the Murray-Darling Basin, with 1,789 gigalitres being applied, which represented nearly 40 per cent of all irrigation water used in 2010-11.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For 2011-12, the ABS reported that 1,996 gigalitres were applied to cotton production in the Murray-Darling Basin, nearly one third - 32 per cent - of all water used in the Basin in that year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Curiously, the most recent ABS report for 2016-17 doesn't give figures for agricultural water use in the Murray-Darling Basin but does give figures for national volumes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2016-17 cotton used 2,566 gigalitres of 9,104 gigalitres of national water use - 28.2 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given that there is hardly any cotton grown outside the Murray-Darling Basin, the percentage of water used for cotton production in the Basin is probably rather higher. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cotton is the single largest piece of the challenge of managing the water resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And although the Royal Commission report does not single out cotton, in the absence of Commonwealth, state and territory government commitments to fully implement the Commission's recommendations, that is precisely what must be done in Australia's national interest and the health of our rivers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is intended to trigger a national debate on the future of the cotton industry in the context of its impact on the Murray-Darling Basin. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Centre Alliance's firm view is that major choices need to be made and that the environmental health of the river system, water and food security must be our national priorities, not cotton exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Exporting cotton is like exporting water. Australians live on the driest continent on the planet yet are using our precious national water resources to produce a water intensive crop which we then export overseas so that foreign entities can profit from making textiles and clothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Export cotton production should not be given the same priority as food producers, or for that matter, the towns and cities dependent on the river system for water supply, and the overall environmental health of the river system all the way to the Coorong lagoon in South Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will prohibit absolutely the export of cotton grown in Australia. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not unusual to regulate or, in some cases ban, the export of agricultural commodities in the national interest. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Export Control Act 1982</span> allows the making of regulations relating to "prescribed goods" that are declared as such by regulations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Subsection 7(1) of the Export Control Act provides that regulations may prohibit the export of prescribed goods from Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will insert new section 7AA which would provide that three years after the section commences, the regulations are taken to have declared that cotton grown in Australia is a prescribed good; and prohibited absolutely the export of that cotton.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The prohibition will apply to the export of cotton grown anywhere in Australia. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The production of cotton for use in Australia will not be affected. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In this regard it should be noted that section 99 of the Australian Constitution provides that the Commonwealth "shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill is intended to be compliant with this constitutional provision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The three-year time frame before the ban will take effect will allow cotton farmers to anticipate and prepare for an end to cotton exports. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No doubt some cotton farmers may shift production to other irrigated crops. Some may move to other activities including significantly less irrigated water. Overall, it could be anticipated that termination of the cotton export market would result in significant reduction in demand for Murray-Darling Basin water resources. This would provide an opportunity to return significant volumes of water to the environment, consistent with the objectives of the Water Act to manage the Basin water resources "in the national interest" and to "protect and restore the ecosystem of the Murray‑Darling Basin". </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Significantly the proposed three-year time frame will also provide the Australian Government and the governments of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory time to reconsider and implement the recommendations of the Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If governments are able to come together and adopt policies based on open and transparent science, and consideration of the national interest rather than the defence of narrow sectional interests, the measure proposed in this Bill may well prove unnecessary. In the absence of such action, however, the environmental degradation of the river system will undoubtedly continue and calls for radical action, most likely focussed on the cotton industry, will most likely grow. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

I do not intend to now. The reason was that in October the Prime Minister promised that his apology would be given practical meaning by 'concrete action' through the National Redress Scheme. Why I said that I would resign is because I don't think the government is taking this redress scheme as seriously as it should. We have trouble getting government members on that committee to appear at hearings to provide a quorum. Senator Gichuhi jumped in at the last minute today for a short time just to keep the committee going. It is not good enough, and I say to government leaders in both houses, please get your act together and come to the committee.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I rise today to speak in favour of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission of Inquiry Bill 2019. This summer we have seen before our eyes what scientists, ecologists and river communities have been warning us about for years: an ecosystem in collapse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unprecedented mass fish deaths in Menindee have crystallised the crisis unfolding in the nation's most important river system. The Productivity Commission has raised concerns about the capacity of the current management and governance arrangements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Meanwhile, the South Australian Royal Commission slammed the Plan, the Authority, and management by the Basin States. Commissioner Bret Walker found instances of corruption and maladministration. He raised questions about the validity of the Environmentally Sustainable Level of Take, and the very lawfulness of the Plan itself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Scientists have been telling us that the 2750GL water recovery target is inadequate. The South Australian Royal Commission found a target that appropriately considered the environment would be somewhere between 3980GL and 6980GL. Throughout the Basin it is clear there is not enough water. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have seen cases of fraud, donation scandals and corruption. If we are to save the Murray-Darling Basin, what we need are not prayers but answers and a plan of action. We know there is not enough water in the river. So where is the water? Why is so much less water making it downstream? How do we account for the fish deaths, and for the ill-health of the Coorong? Why has a water management plan, designed to deal with drought, failed at the first hurdle? Why hasn't Queensland had questions to answer? How did cotton have a bumper crop last year? Why isn't anyone talking about floodplain harvesting? These questions, and many others, must be answered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission made comprehensive findings, key individuals and agencies were prevented from giving evidence at the Commission. Thus far its findings have been side-stepped by those who need to heed them if the river is to survive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2017, then Minister, Barnaby Joyce bragged to irrigators that he had taken water away from the environment. In NSW, Minister for Regional Water, Niall Blair gave himself the right to retrospectively approve illegal floodplain works in the Barwon-Darling, even if they do not comply with the plan. Meanwhile, Ernst &amp; Young have found "unique fraud risks" in an analysis of the $3.2 billion fund set aside to purchase environmental water, meaning that money could be paid without any water ever being recovered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not just individual ministers. In 2018, the Liberal National Government, with the support of Labor, passed a 70GL cut in the water recovery target for the Northern Basin. In the Southern Basin, the decision to pay for 'water efficiency measures' instead of buying back 605GL also had bipartisan support. This leaves less and less water for the environment. Now we have a million dead fish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that the power and greed of corporate irrigators, the politicians who are happy to serve their interests, coupled with a plan that leaves too much to chance, handshakes, winks and nods have combined to deliver less and less water to a river system already under strain. We are seeing the river system dying before our eyes for the sake of corporate greed and political power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not impossible to save the Murray-Darling. It is not impossible to manage healthy, thriving river systems in ways that benefit the environment, communities, and businesses. But to get there we need answers, those responsible need to be held to account, and we need to overhaul our broken plan. It is time to take a look under the hood of corporate cotton, corruption, and climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Commission of Inquiry will ensure that no stone is left unturned. It will examine misconduct, the implementation of the plan and any adverse effects it has on the environment, agriculture and river communities, the allocation of funds and the real impact these funds have had or not had on environmental watering, and the impact of climate change on Basin water resources. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If we are to understand what has happened to our precious rivers and find solutions, we need to get to the bottom of what has gone on and look for solutions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I urge you to support this Bill; the survival of our nation's most important river system hangs in the balance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

What is clear is that families are hurting, livestock has been decimated, infrastructure has been damaged and for some time the people of north-west and North Queensland will need help. Natural disasters like this are above politics. We would like the people of Queensland to know that, although we are down here, we will always fight for you and do what we can to help.</span>

There have been reports that there has been a death in Townsville due to a person contracting a dangerous soil-borne disease and that this risk has increased due to the floods. It reminds us all that the current situation is critical and will have ongoing long-term effects. The opposition stands with the government as one, ready to do anything we can to assist those who need help.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Water Amendment (Purchase Limit Repeal) Bill 2019 will repeal Barnaby Joyce's 1500GL cap on buybacks. We need as many tools as possible to get the Basin Plan back on track. At the moment, if the supply projects, the 605GL of "down water" projects, don't deliver results then buybacks is not an option. If the Murray‑Darling Basin Authority recommends that more water for the environment is needed, then buybacks may not be an option. We need options. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the review of the Basin Plan draws nearer then we need to remove barriers to implementing the Basin Plan. The Basin is under pressure and the government doesn't seem to care. The fish kills south of Menindee are a stark reminder of what happens when you ignore nature. When we learnt of the fish kills Labor asked the Prime Minister to take action - and no action was taken. Labor therefore sought scientific advice from the Academy of Sciences regarding mass fish kills—then the government decided to undertake a similar study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government did not act until Labor took action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When the fish kills occurred Labor's Shadow Minister for Water visited Menindee to inspect the disaster first hand, and to meet with locals. The government was nowhere to be seen. Again it was Labor at a state and federal level taking the lead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Productivity Commission and the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission have both produced reports regarding implementation of the Murray‑Darling Basin Plan. These reports raise serious issues in regard to the Coalition government's ability to manage Australia's water resources. They highlight that at every turn people like Barnaby Joyce turned the dial against river health. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Joyce wrote to the South Australian Minister attacking the 450GL of water for the environment. He boasted in a pub that he was fighting against water reform. The government has been attacked for ignoring the science, for allowing water theft to occur and for secrecy. Labor raised those issues, and sought assurance from the government. And to their credit the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Mr Littleproud, took action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The question is—is it enough to undo the harm of those that went before him on the Coalition side?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor wants the Basin Plan delivered in full. We want every option for water purchase looked at, noting that it is voluntary purchase; it's not forcing someone to sell. It is running a tender.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We also want infrastructure projects to work and for the supply measures to deliver but we won't close off options if they don't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 1500GL cap on buybacks wasn't part of the Basin Plan and when it was supported a few years ago Labor said our support was conditional that it didn't impact on achieving the objectives of the Basin Plan. By removing the cap we are giving options to government, to act on advice they receive and to use buybacks if the 605GL of projects don't deliver.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Passports and drivers' licences are protected in part from fraudulent use by having photographic identification of the person to whom they are issued. I see no reason why this should not apply also to Medicare cards. </span>

                    </a>  While Hakeem al-Araibi's return to Australia was an absolutely joyous event, we can't look past the fact that he was detained in Thailand and spent months locked up fearing for his very life and that this was clearly because of decisions and mistakes made by Australian government agencies. As a refugee and permanent resident of this country, Hakeem was owed a duty of care. Australian authorities failed him and that failure could have cost him his life. We need to find out what happened so we can do everything we can to stop it happening again. To just inquire into this in Senate estimates will not result in recommendations being made and will not result in the required lengthy examination of the key people involved in the decision to dob Hakeem into the Thai authorities, a government with a death penalty. I trust the Senate will back this motion.</span>

                  </a>  The issue of pill testing is largely a matter for the states and territories. The Australian government supports decisions not to use illicit drugs and does not support pill testing as it could imply that illicit drugs are safe. All illicit drug use contains inherent risks, and even taking a known substance can result in unintended harm. It is also important to note that pill testing may not be able to identify all components in an illicit substance, and does not take into account any underlying health conditions a person may have, or interactions with any other substances or medications a person may have taken.</span>

                  </a>  Labor has been saddened by the tragic deaths of Australians at music festivals this summer. We are committed to drug policies that complement law enforcement with harm minimisation, early intervention and effective treatment. As the Greens party knows, responsibility for this issue lies with each state and territory and their health, ambulance and police services. We note the leadership of the ACT Labor government, which has conducted Australia's only pill-testing trial, and New South Wales Labor, which will convene a summit on pill testing and other harm minimisation measures if it wins the upcoming election. That reflects the fact that pill testing is a complex issue, and further consideration and consultation is required. Labor considers this motion calling on the federal government to take action is premature and not targeted to the appropriate level of government. As such, we will not be supporting this motion.</span>

                  </a>  One Nation will not be supporting this motion. Safe drugs don't exist. The same pill can have different effects on different people. On the one hand, pill testing will give the user a sense of false security if deemed safe. On the other hand, it may even lead to on-selling of the drug if deemed unsafe. Even if a pill is tested and deemed to be safe, it can still have adverse effects on the user, depending on the circumstances of the day, their health and what else they've been taking during the day. Onsite pill testing may be fast and easy, but it's not particularly accurate. Proper analysis of a pill requires highly sophisticated laboratory equipment, and it can take days. It would be better to target the manufacturers, the distributors and the sellers of these drugs, instead of the end user. These are illicit drugs, and their use should never be encouraged.</span>

I've said here before: I'm sick of watching the six o'clock news and seeing big burly coppers with guns on their hips arresting pot plants. We have to try something different. This is a trial.

Where it has been introduced, it hasn't led to an increase in drug use but what it has done is save lives. If we don't want a mother or father, a brother or sister to get that call at three in the morning informing them that a loved one has died then we have to get real, and the reality is that people are using these substances.</span>

It's incumbent on us to put in place measures that we know work. The government says it sends the wrong message. Well, a message given by a health professional that says, 'Take this drug and it may kill you,' is not the wrong message; it's the right message. Having an authority say to individuals, 'If you are going to take it, we are going to do it in a way that makes it as safe as possible,' is exactly the message we should be sending people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  While the government cannot confirm the sources and accuracy of the information quoted in the motion, we would like to add that it has been over 20 years since the Defence Force changed the policy to enable lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex members to serve in the Australian Defence Force openly, without fear of losing their career, which marked the beginning of a journey reflecting Defence's commitment to a fair, inclusive and equitable workplace. Defence and the government have previously apologised to all members of the Australian Defence Force who suffered sexual, mental and physical abuse during their service. There are avenues available to both current and former ADF personnel who feel they have suffered abuse during their service.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In the case of the Rocky Hill Coal Project, the aggregate GHG emissions over the life of the Project are sizeable, although the Project is not one of the largest coal mines in Australia. The Minister noted that the proposed production of the Rocky Hill mine appears to be about a third of the production of the average coal mine in NSW (Minister's closing submissions, [423]). Refusal of consent to the Project would prevent a meaningful amount of GHG emissions, although not the greater GHG emissions that would come from refusal of a larger coal mine. However, the better reason for refusal is the Project's poor environmental and social performance in relative terms. As I have found elsewhere in the judgment, the Project will have significant and unacceptable planning, visual and social impacts, which cannot be satisfactorily mitigated. The Project should be refused for these reasons alone.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  I have been fortunate in my life to have three honours bestowed on me. The first was to be made a life member of the Apex clubs of Sapphire City in Inverell. Sadly, Apex is waning throughout Australia. The second honour bestowed on me was back in 2006, when the New South Wales National Party Central Council preselected me as No. 1 on their Senate ticket. Hence, at the 2007 election, I was the 532nd Australian elected to the Senate since 1901. The third honour bestowed on me was to have a cricket ground in Perth named after me called the WACA! Well, it's worth a try. I'll check with Peter Taylor later on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad to have contributed almost 11 years of my time here. When I first started, we received a $4,800 a year increase to our electoral allowance. I thought I could live without it, so each year I have donated it to a rural dental scholarship, for someone from a regional area who is going to do a first year dentistry degree, in the hope that they will return to regional areas and increase the number of dentists out there. It has been a very successful program. Each and every one of those who have come forward for the scholarship have done very well. Something like six or seven of them have completed their degrees and are now practising dentistry in regional Australia. Can I thank the National Rural Health Alliance for their management of that scholarship. Geri Malone is here today. I went to school with Geri in the early 1960s in Jamestown. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great jobs I've had here is chairing the Parliamentary Friendship Group between Australia and Ireland. I thank Your Excellency, Mr Breandan O Caollai, and your wife, Carmel, for being here today. It has been a wonderful time meeting you and having something to do with you, and I hope one day we can visit your country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the almost 11 years I've been in the Senate, I've been pleased to play a role in many things. I remember back in January 2009, when I had been a senator for seven months, I was called up to Redcliffe and Brisbane to meet the victims of Storm Financial. It was not a pretty picture, I can assure you. There were people who were 65, 75 and even older who had worked all their lives, saved, got some financial advice and invested in Storm Financial. It looked like they would be kicked out their houses onto the street. They were way past their working life. They could not rebuild. All I could promise them was a parliamentary inquiry, which we had, which was conducted by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The government's response to that inquiry became the FOFA laws. The committee was chaired by—what was his name?—Bernie Ripoll. That's the bloke. Sorry, Bernie, I forgot your name. Terrible on names, I am! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The one sad thing that I see about the Senate is that it works a lot better than the public think. When the public look at the TV, they see hand grenades being thrown around the chamber—a bitter atmosphere. It is not like that at all. We work closely together on our committee work and we have achieved so much. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember when I launched a banking inquiry back in 2011. We were in Parliament House in Sydney, on Macquarie Street, and I asked one of the bank chiefs, 'Why did your bank give a 30-year loan to a 97-year-old lady who's in an aged-care facility?' Strange enough, the senator with a strong Scottish accent interjected, which is pretty rare in this place! He said: 'How old did you say she was, Senator Williams?' I said, 'Ninety-seven, Senator Cameron.' He said, 'Must be a bloody good aged-care facility!' The bank manager went to jail for six months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009, I launched the liquidators inquiry. I see they're in the headlines again today. We had full unified recommendations. Sadly, nothing was done for many years, and I thank Kelly O'Dwyer for bringing those changes in now. We had one liquidator who did not have a very good reputation. He was in charge of Carlovers, a Malaysian car wash company. He took overseas trips. He took his kids overseas, went on holidays et cetera. He spent three years in jail once we'd finished with him. It took Carlovers $1.8 million to fight in the courts to have him removed. Now, with a majority vote in value of the creditors, with just one meeting, the liquidators can be removed. So that's made them sharpen their pencil and hopefully do their job better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember going to a meeting in Sydney. I'd been invited there by a bloke by the name of Mr Jeff Morris. We had an interesting chat about financial planning. I'll talk more about that later on. Not that long ago we completed the life insurance inquiry, and there's certainly some work due there. I'm glad to see the FSC has adopted virtually every recommendation it can in relation to life insurance. Of course, I pushed for a royal commission for many years. That's just been wound up, and I will have more to say about that soon as well. The best of the Senate is when the committees are working together, and I'll talk about our franchise inquiry before I finish as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember, after meeting with Jeff Morris, a whistleblower from Commonwealth Financial Planning, we were in Senate estimates and I asked a question to ASIC. I said, 'Why did it take you 16 months to act on the whistleblower's information about the Commonwealth Bank, the "ferrets"?' We got a strange answer which was nowhere near the answer. So I repeated the question, and, once again, no answer. I turned to the then chair, Mark Bishop, a Western Australian Labor senator, and said, 'Chair, how do you get these people to answer a question?' Talking about Senator Cameron, his staff member said, 'Hey, Dougie, they're belting Wacka up.' So Senator Cameron came up to the committee room, and he said to me, 'I'm coming in to help you out, mate.' He put a few questions to ASIC in probably a firmer way than I did. When we'd finished that question session and Senator Cameron had read the riot act, he said to me, 'Wacka, we should have an inquiry into ASIC.' I said, 'Good idea.' It was Senator Cameron's idea. We launched the inquiry, and it became clear that Macquarie Private Wealth and the whole financial planning systems were so wrong. The inquiry was chaired by Mark Bishop, a good fellow from Western Australia—a good bloke—and he did a good job. We recommended a royal commission. That was when a royal commission was recommended by a committee—when we had the inquiry into ASIC. Now it's a bit sad to see the politics being played, but, if both sides of the chamber had listened to that recommendation back in those days, in 2014, we would have achieved a lot more a lot sooner. However, as they say, better late than never.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Things I have achieved people would probably not be familiar with: the Personal Property Securities Act and the Personal Property Securities Register. It probably means nothing to the people of Australia, but hire companies would hire their machinery or their equipment out, and, if they hired it out for longer than 12 months, they'd have to register it on the Personal Property Securities Register. If they made one digit mistake on their ABN or ACN number or anything on the date, it was invalid. If the company who'd hired their equipment went broke, the receivers and the banks could take their equipment. The hire companies actually lost their equipment. I'm glad to have been part of getting that changed. It's now up to two years, and we put some relief on the industry as it is now. Can I say that the best work we do in the Senate here is the work people never know about. It's the work we do behind the scenes, working with people, solving problems. I think that's part of politics—solve as many problems as you can for the people you represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had a very fortunate life, when I look back at family history. My grandfather, Eric, served on the battlefields of France. My late father, Reg, was a rear gunner on a Lancaster bomber—apparently not a very good job at all. I was of the fortunate generation; I never had to go to war. Perhaps the only wars I've fought were in this building. Had a few wins, had a few losses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a long list of thankyous to go through here. Can I start with our Clerk, Richard Pye, and your staff, who are magnificent people who work hard and are very well respected. Thank you, Richard, Maureen, Tim, Jane, Jackie and all the crew for the wonderful work you do. Your advice is always spot on and you're always very relaxed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we needed your advice big time in a recent inquiry into the franchise industry, where Senator Ketter, Senator Whish-Wilson, Senator Deb O'Neill and I were involved in a hearing. It was the first time in 10½ years that we actually had to summons a witness, Mr Tony Alford from Retail Food Group. We wrote to Mr Alford and Ms Atkinson and said, 'We have the power to summons you,' and the reply was, 'If you summons us, we'll take you to the High Court.' It united the committee like never before. Each and every one of us, right around the political scene, ganged up and said, 'We won't be pushed about.' We put the summons on them and they took us to the High Court. They ran second, and there are no second prizes in court decisions. It reaffirmed that we do have the power to summons people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The franchise industry inquiry has been a big inquiry. We will report very soon. There's a lot of repair to do there. We've had a lot of inquiries into the franchise industry since the mid-1970s. The fact that we're doing it again proves we never got it right. I hope that when that inquiry is handed down and the election is out of the road, the government acts on it and acts on it quickly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The friendship built through the committee work is unbelievable. As I said, it's a sad perception that in this chamber we seem to be all enemies. That is not the case. In fact, I remember when we had an induction into here—our training before we were sworn in—they said, 'Some of your best friends will be on the other side.' How true that is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I have a long list of thankyous. To the chamber staff—John, Adrian, Bryan, Fiona, Rosemary and Commodore Wally—thank you for your great work and for helping us all the time. Thanks to the COMCAR drivers that we get spoiled rotten with. Thanks to the security people around here that keep us safe in this building—sadly that's the case these days; you need a lot of security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make special thank you to the bank representation. I've worked closely with the banks. People might think I'm the banks' enemy, but I'm not. I thank the banks who worked closely with me, and Aron Whillans, Jade Clarke, Rob Lomdahl from ANZ and many others. I thank them for working with us, because when we work the problems out behind the scenes there are no headlines and virtually no cost. Often I say, 'Well, the bank has got it wrong here,' but many, many times I say, 'No, the customer has got it wrong as well.' It's good to be able to sort those problems out behind the closed doors.</span>

Would it be dozens or would it be hundreds? However, it came to light and, sadly, former Senator Fiona Nash, we lost you. You were a great mentor to me and a great friend, and I wish you all the best. My Senate colleagues. To our leader Nigel Scullion, thanks, mate, for your friendship, leadership and guidance. One of your great passions is our First Australians, and you've worked very hard. To our deputy leader, Senator Bridget McKenzie, you're good at sport, Bridge, and I know you love the portfolio of sport, from netball to clay duck shooting. I wish you all the best.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank the media, who I've worked closely with. I've had a really good run with the media! There was only once when I was in a bit of a jam. Let me explain it to you. I was doing an interview with BBC in London with a bloke by the name of Phil Williams, no relation. It was over two illegal immigrants. Their names were Pistol and Boo. This is how it went: 'On the line we have Senator Williams with us, a good friend of Minister Joyce. Good evening, Senator Williams.' I said, 'Good evening, Phil.' He asked, 'Why does Australia have such strict quarantine?' Well, you know the spiel: we're a clean, green country; we're a big food-exporting country; we need to keep the diseases out and so on. Then he played it—the tape. He said, 'Let me play what your minister said.' Minister Joyce: 'As far as I'm concerned, Pistol and Boo can bugger off back to the States.' I thought, 'What am I going to say here?' Phil asked, 'Senator, is that how ministers speak in the Australian parliament?' I scratched my head and said, 'You must remember one thing, Phil, and never forget it: the English invented the English language, but Australia perfected it!' At that, he burst out laughing, and I got out of jail—out of that wedge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I thank the media I've worked with. Now, I'm going to start with the really important media. To Ando at radio 2VM in Moree—I talk to you all the time, Ando, and you're a great fella. We never played politics—we simply got the message out that people needed to learn about things that are changing here. To radio 2AD, Pete Raymond and his team, in Armidale. To Inverell radio—and we're actually being broadcast live on 91.9 FM radio in Inverell now—to Gerry Taveira, John Shaw and the crew up there, thank you very much for your time and support and the way that the media helps us get the message out about what we're doing. To the ABC, both in regional Tamworth and Muswellbrook, thank you for your great work. It's always been a pleasure to talk to you. And thank you to Prime and NBN in Tamworth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I thank many in the media here in Parliament House. We've become good friends, and I think you've been very fair to me. But I think the reason you're fair to me is I just answer the question. I remember I was doing an interview with Patricia Karvelas one day for ABC Radio National. I was on the tractor. I had to talk to her at five past five, so I set my alarm for five o'clock to turn the tractor off, cool it down, cool the turbo down and turn it off. At five past five the phone rang, and the question went something like this: 'Senator, what's the government doing about that?' I said, 'I don't know.' She said, 'But you're part of the government.' I said, 'I don't talk to the Prime Minister every morning. He doesn't ring me first up.' I asked, 'Would you like me to make something up?' At that, she laughed, and we've been pretty good friends ever since. So the message is: tell the truth all the time and you'll get a good run, folks! Can I thank my friends in the media. I can't name you all, but you know who I'm talking about—Joe Kelly, Sabra Lane, Lane Calcutt, Phil Coorey, Mark Riley and many of you here. You've been very kind to me. We've become good friends, and I've enjoyed your friendship. And thank you for never ringing me after party room meetings because you knew I wouldn't talk to you anyway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the media, can I please thank the great team at Sky News—David Speers and my good friend Janine Perrett, who is here today from Sydney. Thank you, Janine. I'm sorry Paul Murray couldn't make it—it's a late scratching—and Ross Greenwood as well. Can I thank my great mate Piers Akerman. In this job, you get to meet some great people, and, Piers Akerman, you're one of them. When I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, Piers Akerman went along to a Parkinson's conference to find out what he could learn about the disease to help me. That's a testament to what sort of people he and his wife, Susan, are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But one of the great things Piers Akerman did was many years ago in Adelaide at <span style="font-style:italic;">The Advertiser</span>. He gave a young lady a start in the media. Her name was Adele Ferguson AM. Adele, we've done a lot of work together and we've achieved a lot together. Thank you for being here today with Christian and with your daughter. I will cherish the memories. As Adele said to me, 'When the media and politics teams up, it becomes very powerful.' When I first met with Jeff Morris, the whistleblower from Commonwealth Financial Planning, he asked, 'Senator, what should we do?' I said, 'I think you should give it to the media.' He asked, 'Do you know anyone?' I said, 'Yes, I do.' I handed the story to Adele Ferguson: 900 pages for her to read. Out of that came some changes for the betterment of all Australia and a Gold Walkley Award for Adele Ferguson. Well done! You'll have to extend your house soon, Adele, to fit all the awards in!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Inverell community; they've been great supporters of mine. They've been very good to me. We have a serious fire up there today; it's burnt about 15,000 acres in the Tingha area. I hope everyone is safe and I hope they get on top of it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I need to thank my staff. When I started on 1 July 2008 I had four full-time staff: Greg Kachel; Debbie Kachel, his wife; Heather Morris; and Gary Lamrock. Here we are, nearly 11 years later, and my four full-time staff are: Greg Kachel; his wife, Debbie Kachel; Heather Morris; and Gary Lamrock. That means I'm either a pretty good boss or jobs are bloody scarce in Inverell—one of the two! But people know what Greg's like; he works hard. You can ring my office in Inverell at 7 o'clock in the morning and Greg's there to answer it every weekday. Everyone in the building knows Greg and how reliable he is. He gets back to you all the time. Thank you, Greg, for your great work, for your mentoring and for slowing my speech down when we first got here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You often hear Greg calling the races on Sky, 'We'll now cross to Inverell to Greg Kachel in Moree,' or wherever he's calling the races from. He's a great race caller and a great talent. He's been 32 years in radio, including 18 years as manager. I think the best scalp I ever got was getting you to come with me, mate! Thank you for your great work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Debbie, your wife: thank you for all your filling in of the diary—telling me where to go, literally. Deb's good at that! It was the diary I lived on, and Deb kept it up to date. She also got very well known with immigration issues; any immigration issue went straight to Deb.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Heather Morris, a former Commonwealth Bank staffer: thank you for keeping me off the front pages for doing the wrong travel claims and all the other things we have to go through. You're an expert at that. And to Gary Lamrock: Gary did all my internet, website and all the work in communications. When I got equal first with Barnaby Joyce for the best communicator, that was you, Gary Lamrock. It's a great scheme, Mr President: they do the work and I get the praise. How much better does it get than that?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Lynne Baldwin on my casual staff: thank you for your work and support. I've been blessed to have the same staff—I think it would be a record. Of the 226 politicians in this building, who can say that they've had the same four full-time staff as when they started nearly 11 years ago? So I'm very proud of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where are we up to? I thank people so much for attending today. People have travelled a long way. My sister, Pauline, and her husband are here from Perth; my brother, Peter, and his wife, Carol, are here from Inverell; and there are my good friends from South Australia. We have been friends for many years, Michael Kelly and I. We met in 1960 and became mates. We played football together and we played tennis together. He was best man at both my weddings—you won't be getting a hat-trick, matey, I can assure you of that! To Bill Hoffman, Greg Boston, Rick Kelly, Liz Kelly and many who have travelled from Inverell down here: thank you so much for being here and for being part of it as I say goodbye to the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my family: it's great to have my eldest son, David, here and his wife, Tammy, with my three grandsons: Finn, Ryan and Jack in my office. It's wonderful to have you here and to have my daughter, Becky, here with her newborn, two-month-old little boy, Lewis. I'm sorry your husband, Pat, couldn't make it, and the two girls, Ella and Lucy, but we'll catch up with them soon. And to my younger son, Tom, and your wife, Dr Sarah Williams—I must add—and your little girl, Claudia, who is five months old: it's great to have you here. Thank you so much for your support and understanding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now to my wife, Nancy. Thank you for your unending support and your understanding. I look forward to getting home and spending every minute with you for the rest of my life. And that's stumps, Mr President. Good luck, everyone, keep well!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="111206" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  I suspect valedictory speeches are a bit like arguing with your wife: you feel it's important to have the last word! There is also the humbling thought that, if you don't sing your own praises, nobody else will. I've already given three speeches setting out what I regard as my achievements in this place. It's not a short list and I don't plan to go over it again. However, I do want to mention two that I'm particularly proud of. One is saving the Malabar rifle range in Sydney for shooters. At the time I was elected, the government had lost two court battles in its efforts to kick the shooters off but was nonetheless engaging in a war of attrition intended to force them off. I convinced the shooters that they should agree to leave if they were provided with somewhere to go of equivalent standard. I informed Senator Cormann that the shooters would sign a lease containing that provision. I also made the point that the land could be sold for hundreds of millions of dollars if the government so decided. It helped that Senator Cormann is a very decent guy. But he is also committed to bringing the budget under control and paying off Labor's debt, so I got his attention. But the poor chap never got to first base when it came to selling the land. There were just too many big government statists on his own side. Nonetheless, he worked with me to ensure the shooters got a secure lease, which includes a provision under which the shooters will leave if they are provided with somewhere to go. So, if we ever do have a government that doesn't think owning highly valuable waterfront land is good government policy, it has a way out. From my point of view, the deal secured the future of the shooting sports in the Sydney Basin for the next 50 years. I'm very proud of that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second was forcing the government to limit the childcare subsidy to those earning less than $350,000 a year. The government was proposing to leave it open-ended so even those earning a million dollars a year could receive a subsidy. In the interests of accuracy, I should mention that I got Senator Hinch involved, too; one vote was not enough. The debate was interesting. The government, Labor and my new best friend, Senator Hanson-Young of the Greens, all spoke against the amendment. Senator Hanson-Young said it was 'galling' for a middle-aged white bloke to be deciding whether women should get child care. But the amendment went through on the voices. Nobody wanted to go on the record as voting in favour of such an egregious example of middle-class welfare. As proof that there's more work to do, I note that I pushed a more ambitious amendment as well to reduce the childcare subsidy for those earning more than $250,000 a year, but this amendment was widely opposed. Middle-class welfare remains a huge problem in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I gave my first speech in this place on 9 July 2014. I was the first of the new crossbench to do so, and since Nick Xenophon's resignation I have been the only one of that crossbench of eight still here. In that speech, I declared that I would never vote for a reduction in liberty or an increase in taxes. I am pleased to say I have stuck to that promise. When bills involve more spending, I don't spend time thinking about them; I simply vote against them. I do the same with bills that increase taxes. If it is to reduce spending, my support is never in doubt; and, if it involves any reduction in our rights and freedoms, count me out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been told many times by people in this place—fellow senators, staffers and media—'At least we know where you stand.' George Brandis referred to me in his valedictory speech as showing 'crystal-clear consistency'. I confess I was at first a bit perplexed by the fact that adhering to clear principles was such a novelty. For some reason—naively, perhaps—I assumed everyone had principles and that's why they were here. It took a while for me to discover that what people believe and what they do in this place are quite different. In fact, I now realise I am rather unusual. But I'm not totally unique. Former senator Lee Rhiannon had clear principles and kept to them. I note that her principles were substantially different from mine, but the fact is we both consistently stuck to our principles. She understood that too. In fact, we had a very cordial chat about it before she resigned last year. It saddens me that people regularly tell me privately how much they agree with me but then vote for something completely contradictory. I am so glad I haven't had to abandon my beliefs in order to retain my seat and salary. I wonder what the outcome would be if there were more like me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is something else I had in common with Lee Rhiannon. While we were never friends, we got on at a personal level. The reason is that both of us play the ball rather than the man. That's something her fellow Greens could well do to emulate, as could a number of other senators. Nick Xenophon played the ball too, though he didn't think of it in those terms. I used to explain to him that, just because he was wrong about practically everything, it didn't mean he was a bad person or that I didn't like him! There are people in this place who go for the person rather than the issue, and they are bad people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would like to return to the matter of principles. When I came into this place, my mission was to convince my fellow Australians and their political representatives that our governments should forgo their over-governing, overtaxing and overriding ways. I am a libertarian. I support John Stuart Mill's view that the only purpose for which power can ever be rightfully exercised over another member of a civilised community against his will is to prevent harm to others. I believe governments should limit themselves to what John Locke advised so wisely more than 300 years ago: the protection of life, liberty and private property. But it's been a challenge. When I was elected, Tony Abbott was Prime Minister; then came Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison. I kept hoping there might be changes in approach. It's true the rhetoric changed a bit and there was a bit of a difference in emphasis, but in reality there's been no deviation from the big-spending, big-taxing approach to government—the idea that government can fix pretty much everything by more regulation and spending other people's money. I've had plenty to disagree with. Notwithstanding the reduction in personal income tax and the attempt to reduce company taxes, both of which I strongly supported, there have been increases in taxes. There was the GST on low-value imports, which will cost more to collect than it will raise, the increase in superannuation taxes, the major bank levy, the diverted profits tax, the huge tobacco tax increases, the reintroduction of fuel tax indexation and the increase in the passenger movement charge—all under a Liberal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have also been monstrosities such as the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which assumes public servants know better than the banks how they should be run. There has been a flood of national security bills which make us all less free and no more safe, give access to our metadata to snoops and, most recently, the absurd idea that somehow Australia can force software companies to allow access to encrypted messages. In each case, of course, there were those arguing it was necessary, but as William Pitt the Younger observed:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some other points I'd like to make in this, my final speech in this place. I am not leaving politics, at least that's not the plan. I still think I have a useful contribution to make at beating back the nanny state, but I want to do it in my home state of New South Wales. In the previous parliament I chaired an inquiry into the nanny state. In this parliament I chaired an inquiry into red tape. Over and over we would make recommendations for change that could only be made at the state level for things like occupational licensing, vaping and smoking, gambling, lockouts, assisted suicide, cannabis, motorbikes, fishing, bicycle helmets and traffic issues, and there are many more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My aim is to use the skills I have developed in this place to achieve changes to state law from the crossbench of the New South Wales Legislative Council. Those skills obviously include leveraging my vote. On the crossbench, we all long for the occasions when the government needs our vote on an issue and we could vote either way, but also negotiation based on reason, common sense and evidence. Strange as it sometimes seems in this place, once in a while I have found these to be persuasive. As to my mission, I am satisfied that I have now made Australians aware that there is no need to take for granted the idea that the government is the solution to every problem. A growing number of people even agree with me that government is more often the problem itself. And I am no longer told my political philosophy is confused. While I'm regularly labelled as right wing, that's mostly by people who don't know what it means. My support for same-sex marriage, for assisted suicide, for cannabis legalisation, for civil rights does not fit very well with the right-wing label. That's because libertarianism is about the freedom of the individual, not merely liberalism within certain parameters. In fact, we libertarians have a little saying: libertarians are plotting to take over the world and leave everyone alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't say I have enjoyed being a crossbench senator all that much. I care about the work a great deal, and it's never boring, but the sheer volume of work is horrendous, the pace ridiculous and the frustrations endless. I know I'm not Robinson Crusoe; I acknowledge the workload of senators beyond the crossbench, where unsung committee work can be gruelling. And I have got to know some very nice people here. The Senate staff, of course, are highly professional and courteous. Committee secretariat staff are very high quality. There's Parliament House security, some of whom are sporting shooters and who support me. There's Annie in the canteen, and the Comcar people. I've also developed friendly relationships with some fellow senators—not just a good number of crossbench senators, but senators on the government side such as Senators Cormann, Scullion, Cash, Canavan, Hume, Ruston and Macdonald, plus senators on Labor's side like Senators Marshall, McAllister, Moore, Farrell and Wong. In fact, I feel guilty leaving out people because, in reality, there are very few with whom I am not on friendly terms, and they're probably not here now anyway. I am placing my political future in the hands of the voters of New South Wales. If they want me to maintain the fight for libertarian values, they will elect me. If not, I'll return to the private sector and my business. I'll accept either outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to thank those who've worked alongside me over the last five years: Duncan Spender and Max Rheese, my loyal and hardworking senior advisers, who have been on this journey with me the entire time, plus my other four loyal and diligent staff. It's a matter of some pride that, unlike most of my crossbench colleagues, I have never dismissed any of my staff. I'm also pretty sure that all of them will still vote for me. Last but not least, I would like to thank my wife of 35 years, Amanda. She loves what I do, misses me when I'm away in Canberra but is hoping like hell I get elected in New South Wales so I don't spend too much time at home. Politics is not easy. Thank you.</span>

                  <a href="HDA" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CORMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  I rise to respond to Senator Williams's and Senator Leyonhjelm's valedictories and, on behalf of the government, to thank them for their service to this parliament, their states, regional Australia—in relation to our friend John Williams—and, of course, our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me start with Senator Williams. In fulfilling its democratic purpose, it is fair to say, this place throws together a diverse mix of people and personalities. I dare say that our friend Senator John 'Wacka' Williams would be counted among the most authentic and decent characters that the Senate chamber has seen. While those traits have undoubtedly helped him get away with his, at times, borderline humour—but always a very entertaining sense of humour, of course—they've also rightly earned him the respect and endearment of so many on all sides in this chamber. He has brought a perspective to this place that few can match, from a life reaching from a farm near Jamestown to grazing land near Inverell, through decades spent in private business and myriad local community organisations, ultimately leading to the federal parliament here in Canberra. Years spent shearing sheep, driving livestock and grain trucks and working on the family farm have ensured that when John has spoken up for Australia's farming communities, he has done so from the most authoritative position of all, a rugged experience. Indeed, when he first arrived in this place, he referred to his alma mater as the university of real-life experience. Nowhere has John's passion been stronger or his focus firmer than when it came to standing up for Australia's farmers, pastoralists and graziers, time and again marshalling his wealth of experience to articulate their interests and craft public policy that delivered for them. Crucially, his own insights were always complimented by those of the regional and rural communities with which he, to this day, maintains a very real and personal connection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of John's consistent priorities has been upskilling the next generation. He has worked hard to connect young people in regional and rural communities to scholarships and higher education opportunities, particularly in the crucial STEM fields. He demonstrated his commitment—and he referenced this during his valedictory contribution—when he donated a $4,800 increase in his electorate allowance to establish a scholarship for country based students studying dentistry. That scholarship was the first of many and continues to change lives and touch country communities today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John's most famous contribution, no doubt, has been borne out of his tireless advocacy for those Australians who have been the victims of malfeasance within the financial sector. Here, he combined his passion for justice with a sharp intellect and great determination. I suspect that many a person who has found themselves on the receiving end of his questions at Senate committee hearings has quickly come to realise that the ABC was right to dub him 'a tenacious and wily inquisitor'. His efforts have helped to secure tangible improvements in Australia's largest industry that are today making it harder for the shocking behaviour of the past to be repeated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Notably, he championed the creation of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, which came into being just months ago and is already staking out an important place within the nation's financial services integrity framework. When away from the committee room, he has served as the ever ready Nationals Whip in the Senate for many, many years. I'm told that with its funniest member now departing, those in the early morning whips' meetings are now searching for someone to brighten them up as they start another exciting day in our nation's capital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With his shearer's fingers twitching, John has never once allowed life in the Canberra circuit to blot out the world outside. I note that he first joined Apex in 1981—he referenced this—and was granted life membership of its Sapphire City club in 1995 and that even today he's a member of the Inverell East Rotary Club. Here, again, the words from his first speech ring true when he lauded his native Jamestown as 'a community where people were and still are willing to lend a hand to others'. Be it in the Senate chamber or a paddock in country New South Wales, John has very clearly carried that spirit with him throughout his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also recognise and acknowledge the efforts of his staff, in particular those of Greg, Deb, Garry and Heather, who, I gather, are the only staff you have ever had in the whole period in this place, which is, indeed, quite an amazing achievement. I recognise the efforts of his staff who have worked in John's team from his very first day here. John is known to say that their longevity probably owes to the lack of other jobs in Inverell, and he made that joke here today. But in the spirit of this evening, I think we'll give him the benefit of the doubt: we know that they stayed around not only because he's an incredible boss but also because they were part of something exciting in terms of the contribution that they were able to make with you to the betterment of your community and communities around Australia and, indeed, our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John, you've been a superb colleague and have achieved something very special here, forging a reputation for clear and unwavering conviction but never letting that passion detract from a decency and collegiality that you have extended to parliamentarians of all sides. We wish you, Nancy and your beautiful family all the very best for your future endeavours and hope that you enjoy some well-deserved rest on the farm—I'm not sure that it's all that restful when you're back at home. It's certainly not restful when I go back home and we all get a list of jobs that need to be done! Nevertheless, I wish you and we wish you all the very best for your future together, and no doubt we will all stay in touch over the months and years to come. Happy shearing!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also would like to mark the contribution of Senator David Leyonhjelm. Coming to the Senate as a self-declared libertarian, David has left a lasting mark on the parliament during his time here. David's senatorial career began with a first speech that traced his philosophical bearings to those thinkers who shaped so much of the world that we live in today: Mill, Locke, Hume and many others. David has been consistently faithful to those ideas. He has defended the notion of individual freedom and enterprise with energy and intellectual rigour. Given his status as a stalwart of constitutionalism and liberal democracy, I can't help but note a tinge of irony in the fact that he is, in fact, the descendant of Swedish nobility, dating back to the Leijonhielm barony of 1719—and I see him smile. I guess we don't have to worry that the sequence of citizenship followed all the way through the generations of nobility moving forward since 1719. In light of the churn in Senate membership over the past 18 months, I assume that we can safely surmise that those ties with Swedish nobility were comprehensively cut some time ago—an individualist to the end!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the years since he delivered that first speech, it has been well established that David's affinity for abstract political principles is matched by a formidable policy brief and keen intellect. His contributions have also been informed by a stock of life experience that he has leveraged regularly—lessons gleaned by growing up on his family dairy farm in western Victoria, practising professionally as a veterinarian, running his own business and pursuing a range of extracurricular activities, most notably as an avid and accomplished shooter. Reflecting on that hobby, I must say that it is not all that difficult to determine when you find yourself in David's sights! David has always displayed considerable intellectual strength. He was never afraid to be in a minority of one, although it doesn't really help being in a minority of one when you try to call for a division, as he had to learn reasonably quickly when he first arrived! He was the patron saint of many unfashionable causes here in this place, but only if they were consistent with freedom of enterprise and the individual. While he always knew where he stood, even if on occasion that was alone, he also made a great effort to engage with the government constructively on a broad range of issues, and that's something I particularly personally very much appreciate. In particular, I draw attention to the occasions on which he supported the government's efforts to strengthen our economy, create more jobs and build a brighter future for the Australian people. At those moments, stretched, as I referred to in question time earlier, from the start of the government's term, with his strong support for the abolition of the carbon and mining taxes, he was a reliable supporter of budget repair and the rule of law, as can be seen with his backing of the re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. At other times, we have differed on the issues, but whatever the topic David has put forward his views frankly, forthrightly and forcefully, in the best traditions of our country's democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">David, it has been an absolute pleasure having you as a colleague over the past several years. I've always very much enjoyed working with you and I've always appreciated the spirit in which you engaged with us, looking creatively for solutions that could help secure a consensus to enable the country to move forward. As you prepare to leave this place, we thank you again for your service. We know that you aspire to provide some more public service in another place. Best of luck, but, whatever the future holds, we wish you and your wife, Amanda, all the very best for your future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  As Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, I rise to briefly respond to the valedictory statements of Senators Williams and Leyonhjelm. First to 'Wacka' Williams. As he said today, he was born in Jamestown, South Australia and somehow, via a career as a truck driver, shearer, farmer, small-business owner and other things, ended up as a senator for New South Wales. Some South Australians might regard that as a step backwards! We reckon that the fact that he has his roots in the mid-north is probably part of the reason why he is a pretty good bloke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The qualities which make him a good bloke are what somebody described as a 'generally convivial nature'. He hasn't always had positive things to say about some on this side, but he's also had some generous things to say about some on this side. One of the things that Senator Williams talked about today, and I was thinking about it as I was listening to him, was the relationships that people have—genuine friendships and respectful relationships across the chamber. He's right: it's one of the things that we do value—that I do value—and probably one of the things that we don't nurture enough or speak about enough in this place. It didn't surprise me, actually, that Senator Williams spoke fondly of Doug Cameron. I think both senators Williams and Cameron bring to this place an authenticity and a genuineness, both in the way they operate but also in the friendships that they have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Williams' genuineness and character have led him to take some pretty strong positions on various policy areas over the years. He's probably caused those opposite me more worries, in many ways, than this side of the chamber. He's certainly been prepared to put his view, even when it didn't accord with the views of the collective of the government, or the opposition, as they were for a number of years. We might have said at the time that he should have gone harder, but it is the case that he certainly was prepared to put his views. Senator Williams used forums, such as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services and other forums, to shine a light where many people might have preferred he go a little more quietly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also say, as chair of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, that he has actually assisted the opposition in maintaining scrutiny on government regulations. In this place, we do require—if we are to function effectively, particularly on committees—some commitment and dedication from senators from all sides of the chamber. I do want to express on behalf of the opposition our thanks and respect to Senator Williams for the approach he's taken to the committee work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's a tribute to the esteem in which Senator Williams is held that so many people were here today for his valedictory. I've never had the chamber that full for me, so you're doing better! He is an authentic bloke. I was remembering one time when he said across the chamber to me something like: 'You've got a lovely smile! You should smile more!' I thought at the time that there aren't many blokes from whom I'd take that nicely, and I did. So, tick—there you go! It's because he's a decent bloke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank him for his service to the Senate since 2008, and on behalf of all Labor senators I wish you well, Wacka, for your retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Leyonhjelm: I remember meeting Senator Leyonhjelm when he first came in—reading about him and thinking: 'Wow! This bloke, he's right out there.' Then I had a meeting with him pretty early on, with Bill Shorten. Afterwards, Bill and I talked to each other—I think it was with a couple of the crossbenchers—and I said: 'Well, it's going to be pretty clear, isn't it? He's got a really consistent view. He actually has a philosophical view and we know what we might get him on and we know what we won't get him on.' And, actually, that's been pretty much the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Your comments, Senator Leyonhjelm, about having principles and consistency are correct. I have pretty much always been able to look at a piece of legislation or a procedural matter and know broadly where I reckon your vote would be. That was kind of efficient, wasn't it, because then I didn't have to go to you if I really knew you weren't going to support us. But if there was a chance then we could have a chat!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As he notes, Senator Leyonhjelm is the last senator standing from the crossbench wave that entered this place in July 2014. Now he's decided that the regulations of the state of New South Wales are in his sights. Senator Leyonhjelm has prosecuted his case with zeal. I want to thank him for his early and public stand on marriage equality. That was helpful to the debate. Whilst there are a number of areas of policy on which he and the Labor Party don't agree, I do want to record that Senator Leyonhjelm always dealt with me civilly, always dealt with me honestly and was willing to listen to our arguments and manage differences professionally. I thank him for that. I'm sure he will understand why Labor senators don't wish him too much luck as he resigns in the Senate to contest the state election next month. I think Senator Keneally put it well: 'I don't wish you luck, but I wish you well.' I reprise her words on that and I also, on behalf of opposition senators, thank Senator Leyonhjelm for his service to this place.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WHISH-WILSON:</span>
                  </a>  Good. He's called himself that. I just want to say to Wacka: I really appreciated the time that you drove five hours to come to Byron Bay to support a sharks inquiry that I was chairing. I know you were fundamentally opposed to my view on protecting great white sharks and other shark species, but you drove five hours just to give me a quorum for my hearing, which I really appreciated. What I really like about Wacka is that, although he is pretty good at politics, he often put politics aside and focused on the issues. I think that's a pretty rare thing to do in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I gave an interview to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> earlier this week and I explained how I first met Wacka. He'd called my office—this is when I'd just started as a senator, in 2012, and I didn't really know who he was—and one of my staff said, 'This Nationals bloke has called you and he wants you to give him a call back.' But I never got around to it. He bailed me up in the corridor and said: 'I hear you used to work in the banks and that you understand financial markets. I'd really like you to come onto the economics committee. We've got this inquiry coming up into the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. We're going to be taking on a lot of stuff and I think you'd be a really good addition to the team.' At the time, I had other priorities. I was new and I was learning the ropes. But it's pretty rare for someone to actually want to bring someone onto their committee, or into their political fight in this place, if that person might take some of the shine away from them or, knowing how politics is, if it's not necessarily in their political interests. But Wacka was always, all the way through, focused on getting an outcome and supporting the public and the victims of financial crime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I did join that committee; I did participate in it. I can't say Senator Mark Bishop was as pleased about me being on the committee as Senator Williams was. Nevertheless, history has shown that it was an extremely important Senate inquiry. It was meant be an inquiry into the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. It ended up being into the Commonwealth Bank, because of the scandal and because the whistleblower Jeff Morris came forward, and we made some recommendations, including recommendations for a royal commission. I believe very strongly, from my campaign since then, that that's where it could have ended—in history. It could have ended as a pit stop by the side of the road. Certainly Wacka would be completely honest in saying that his party, his mob, weren't at all interested in a royal commission, and I don't think that changed until very recently. And at the time, I think the story and the evidence shows, Labor were not interested in a royal commission either. In fact, it took nearly two years from that point to get Mr Shorten to sign up to a royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The role I played in working with Senator Williams was that he would always talk to me about things that were going on, he would always have an open door, and I'd always go to him for advice. And all the way through, although he knew his party was opposed to a royal commission, he never gave up. I respect the fact that Senator Williams crossed the floor when the Greens put up a motion in this chamber for a royal commission into banks and financial services. The Greens were sitting on their own over here with Senator Williams. We were the first ones to call for it, and he had the courage of his convictions to cross the floor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to wrap up, I'll say that seeing Senator Williams here tonight for his final speech and seeing the chamber united was a pretty special moment for me. There have been only a couple of those since I've been here, and I think one of those special moments was tonight. That was very much the theme of his talk—that we actually do often work together. People don't see it. They don't always recognise it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, David, as I said to you earlier, I think I've been very privileged to be here as a senator during an extraordinary time in history for my party—that is, my party has been in the balance of power in the Senate for the six years that I've been here. That means we've been able to get up a number of Senate inquiries into things we deeply believe in and are deeply passionate about. We've been able to go out there, collect evidence and go around the country. You've always supported the notion that the Senate's job is to inquire into matters, even if you often disagreed with what we were inquiring into. I remember inquiries like the joint strike fighter and others where you consistently voted with the Greens on that principle. Many times your vote was critical to us getting our inquiries up, so I thank you for that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  Could I also add my comments to the things that have been said about Senator Williams and Senator Leyonhjelm. I came into the parliament at the same time as Wacka—and, for the sake of Hansard, whenever I say 'Wacka', you can insert 'Senator Williams'. Wacka was immediately someone who grabbed your attention. We were getting this school about how the Senate came about and how the Senate was there to represent the states, and I found it a bit bewildering that Senator Williams immediately started arguing for the abolition of the states—after being elected as a senator for New South Wales! He went into this spiel about the northern new state and about how New England should've been a state on its own. I know that's a long-standing issue up in New England, and they actually have developed a crest, which is based on the Scottish lion rampant. I did go up to New England many times. I was a union official based in Muswellbrook and I went to Inverell, Narrabri, Wee Waa and all the way up to Tenterfield, so I've been up to Inverell on a number of occasions. I look around tonight and I think everyone who lives in Inverell is here tonight to pay respect to Senator Williams.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He and I have had some roaring arguments and debates in this place. I'm a bit known for having a go at the National Party now and again. But, every time I did, Wacka would be on his feet straight after me, defending the National Party and attacking me. That's life here. But he and I always got on really, really well. I can't say that about too many on the other side. I've always been respectful and friendly to people on the other side, but I've been very friendly with Wacka. We were on the economics committee at the same time and we went through some of the things that Wacka spoke about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing about Wacka is that he really, really loves Nancy and he really looks after Nancy. It's not often that you find your partner severely injured, but you never get Wacka Williams offside. He began a campaign to limit the speed of mobility scooters because Nancy had been badly injured. It just shows the respect that Wacka has and the love that he has for his wife and family. I think that says everything about him. Again, I echo what Senator Cormann said, he was dogged, he was decent and he was absolutely determined to follow his conscience and the issues that were important to him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He has got terrific staff. Greg Kachel has been around here for as long as I've been here. We all owe so much to our staff, and Wacka took time to deal with that today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, Wacka, you were in the wrong party. I'm a socialist. Wacka is an agrarian socialist. That's the reality. He's a great guy. I don't agree with a lot of his politics, but we've been good friends in the time we've been here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for Senator Leyonhjelm, we've had our moments in this chamber, as you've had with most people—I'm not special in that—but, as I said to you this evening, at least many people know that you were a senator and know that you were here. You've certainly made a mark since you've been here: some good, some not so good and some bloody awful, in my view, but that's how you are and that's what you've done. For someone who doesn't believe in government, you've got this obsession about becoming a parliamentarian. That's another issue—you want to get your voice heard and you're in there and you've argued those points. You and I have had a number of discussions walking down the corridor, because your office is across from mine. We've had some friendly and some not so friendly discussions on the way down here but, again, I have always found you to be very upfront and someone who stands up for his values. I commend you for that. I hate your position on the ABCC—bad call!—but, as has been said, you've always been frank and forthright. You never were going to be the Messiah in here, and you have been at times a very naughty boy. People know you've been here and you've stood up for your principles. I wish you well in the future. I wish Wacka and his family well. Senator Leyonhjelm, I'm with others on the Labor side: I don't wish you success in your parliamentary career in New South Wales, but I do wish you and your family well. You've certainly made your mark when you've been here. I'd like to add my comments to that which has been said earlier. Two particularly special people have been here. Let's see what the future holds. I hope it's not another parliamentary position for you, Senator Leyonhjelm.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCULLION</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  I'm absolutely delighted to rise today to say a few words today about Senator John Williams the Nationals senator for New South Wales, better known, of course, as 'Wacka'. When you're standing in this place at these times it's always a bit of a tears and beers moment. We're having a bit of a celebration about what Wacka Williams, in this case, has achieved, but we're always a bit sad to see them go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've just heard a valedictory from a quintessential Australian. He could've been regaling his mates in the pub about what had happened. That's his style, that's what he sounded like and that's what he has always been. I recall his maiden speech, when he described the mob he was from and his home town of Jamestown, where he grew up, and that community. He said they were the salt of the earth. Of course! We need no better description than to have listened today and to have worked with someone who was quintessentially Australian and absolutely the salt of the bloody earth, as he would tell you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most people who have experienced Wacka know that he brings a particular element, that element of his life experience—growing up in Jamestown, shifting to Inverell, going into business with his brother, going through all of that angst about losing the family farm and all of that. Much of that he's brought to this place: that rich experience of being everything from a penciller at the races to being a truck driver and a shearer, to knowing how to set a rabbit trap, he tells me, with all his fingers still there. He's just a fantastic guy with lots of what I consider to be real-life experience, but I guess in the context of the real world that's just different life experience. I think we should be so grateful he brought that to this place. The other element he would see in his pub as an element of value and respect is hard work. Now Wacka worked hard. He got here earlier; he went home later; if there was a job to done, he went and did it. As we've heard from the Greens, he didn't have to, but he got in the car and drove five hours to give them a quorum. That was Wacka. He was the bloke who brought the value of hard work to this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Knowing Wacka, I know that there are few of us who would have had the same experiences—we all bring different experiences—but he's had some pretty tough times. He'd had some very hard hardships. He'd had a lot of financial hardships and, more recently, he's had some issues with his health. People often wonder how he would have got through that and maintained this humorous good nature about all of those sorts of matters. He's brought so much wealth of knowledge with him: his knowledge as a shearer; his knowledge of agriculture; his knowledge of the banking system, which was pretty focused before he came here. So he's come from some very humble beginnings in the rural mid-north of South Australia, all the way to now calling Inverell, New South Wales, home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His life experience is something that we truly value in the National Party, because those values I've just been talking about—I'm not pretending to own those values, but they are the values of the National Party: hard work; being a reflection of the people you come from. You look like the people who vote from you, you think like the people who vote for you and you champion the people who have put you here. Certainly, that is quintessentially Wacka. He comes from a place where they think like him, talk like him. That's why in regional and rural Australia, in regional and rural New South Wales particularly, he's been able to engage so well with his constituency. And, because he can engage so well, that's why he has become a complete champion for regional and rural Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a great generosity in Wacka. He's a very, very generous individual. We've heard how he so humbly says he was very pleased to help people into a scholarship so that they could become dentists. If they come from the country, they're likely to come back to the country and be dentists. I think it was some $50,000 he put away. It was quite a remarkable contribution which, in effect, came out of his own pocket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I know that Wacka's constituents will consider his retirement a bit of a loss for them. His consistent fighting spirit for regional New South Wales and farmers across the country surely will be missed. But I think he's left a legacy and a new benchmark. Whoever follows Wacka in here as a senator for New South Wales, there is a new benchmark of the values that Wacka has brought to this place: you'd better be hardworking, you'd better be a champion and you'd better know what you're talking about. I think in this building, he has certainly left his mark.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Wacka, as a long-time National whip in the Senate, had his job cut out for him. We're a very small team; a bit of a force to be reckoned with. We don't have any rules about obeying any particular rules; you can all pretty much do what you like. We are self-disciplined. We tend to come to a core. We make sure we don't leave our mates out in the cold. Wacka did an absolutely tremendous job as whip, and could I just acknowledge the fantastic staff that he's had for such a long time. We've all enjoyed working with them, certainly when he was whip and keeping us all in line. I think they've done a great job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly have always enjoyed Wacka's fair dinkum turn of phrase. I think it's something both Wacka and I share, which has landed us both in a bit of hot water on many occasions. As he reflected in his valedictory speech, someone's got to keep the refinement of the British language in hand. So, Wacka, I'm absolutely confident that I speak for everyone on both sides of the chamber when I say that we've always very much admired your down-to-earth nature, your frankness with all of your colleagues and your courage to make your opinions known even when there was a bit of a personal cost. You know, I'm leaning on Wacka and he's saying, 'I know you may not like this, Nige, but this is what I'm going to do.' We've always very much admired that courage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At these times you have to make difficult decisions. You have to stand up for the things you believe in and that your constituents in that part of Australia, in that sector, believe in. And sometimes, I acknowledge, it's a bit of a lonely place to be. Certainly sitting on the other side of the Greens when you're a coalition member is a pretty lonely place to be, but you found that that was essential, and we all respect you very much for those decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think there's another person in this place who fought harder for justice to be brought to the banking and financial industry. There's no doubt about it. There were Wacka's early days in the toing and froing with the banks, with his own farm, and the frustration that he felt and he knew that so many other people felt—that you couldn't do anything about it because they were big; they were huge. They were bigger than you, they had better lawyers, they had better advisers, they were more believable and there were people who had a vested interest. So Wacka felt that he was really the tiny person in that argument. It may not have been part of his motivation but his coming here, because he knew the heartache and devastation that came from being unfairly treated by financial institutions, led to one of the greatest pursuits of his career—his quest to uncover the malpractices of the financial industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Wacka arrived, well before anyone was really focused on this issue, I know he was busy spending countless hours with constituents, particularly farmers who sought his advice on how to deal with unfair treatment and difficulties with the big banks. I know that his genuine care and concern for the wellbeing of the farmers and their livelihoods is something that we can all learn from, because a growing reputation as a champion of farmers dealing with the banks ensured that he had a lot of people lining up at his electoral office. Wacka, to say that you've left a legacy would be an understatement. As a particular news publication so rightly described it when summarising your time in parliament, 'You don't have to be a minister to make a difference in Canberra.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should acknowledge Bozzie—Ron Boswell—and Fiona Nash. They were two great National Party senators. Bozzie used to always lecture me about focusing on more than one thing, and certainly Wacka took his advice. He really focused on things. He knew every in and out, he ran every campaign and he really ensured that people understood what was up and down in that area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, Wacka, thanks so much for being a good mate and contributing to the National Party. Good luck on completing your retirement bucket list. I'm sure this is not the last we hear from you, and I'm sure it's not going to be the last you hear from me, mate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I'm on my feet, I'd also like to acknowledge the time that Senator Leyonhjelm—David—has spent in this place. He's a very unique creature It is part of his personality, not his politics, that, from the moment he took his seat in 2014, he's made me completely cringe a number of times. How can you have this fundamentalism of complete honesty and courage every day? He was quite happy to sit on his own. He had absolutely no friends. Mate, I have to say that we all got used to that. You have very strong and courageous views—you're self-titled as a classic liberal. I can remember you in your maiden speech declaring your quest to convince Australians that governments should forego their overgoverning, overtaxing and overriding ways, and you summed it up by stating that governments should be seeking protection of life, liberty and private property. So, in short, you strongly believe that private citizens, as you tell me, should be left alone. You have a humble family background, hailing from Victoria; an impressive portfolio and tertiary qualifications. You're a vet, you're a lawyer—the list goes on and on. I think, with all of that experience, you certainly can't be accused of making unqualified commentary in this place, mate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that you've worn a number of political hats and you've sought identity through a number of parties. Consistently your views and beliefs regarding the economy, social issues, reducing government, private property, the matter of firearms, free trade and many other areas have become your own. With clearly articulated and developed policy ideas, you have come here with a great deal of knowledge. So whilst many in the chamber don't agree with you on a number of issues, I think we'd all say that we would agree about your huge commitment and strength to sticking to your guns, mate—no pun intended—and not compromising on your views. You've dealt with it all honestly and in a straightforward way. Whilst I mightn't agree with you on most things, I have to say, I've always respected your capacity to remain steadfast in your beliefs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a great deal of common ground with Senator Leyonhjelm. That's probably well known in this place. He's a fellow shooter and a supporter of the rights of hunters and shooters, so it's tremendous to be able to have a companion on the crossbench. When you're voting for us, we can go over and actually discuss the various aspects of the differences between a one-in-12-inch twist and a one-in-11-inch twist when you're using 46 grains of 2208 in a 308 barrel at 100 metres. Other people aren't really interested in those conversations! It's fascinating to us though, mate, and I'll certainly miss those conversations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of myself and others in the National Party, we wish you all the best, mate. I really do. I've no doubt you'll continue to be a formidable force in the world of politics. The fact we've got a shooter and hunter on the side of people continuing in politics is a fantastic thing, so keep up the good work in that. I know that you'll be a significant force, not only in New South Wales but beyond that. Thanks so much for contributing to the diversity of viewpoints and challenging us to think outside the square. I'm really looking forward to having some more time to accompany you in the annoyance of wildlife.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  I want to make a few comments in relation to Senator John Williams. It's already been very well articulated here in the contributions this evening, in relation to the background of Wacka, being a shearer, a truck driver, a farmer and a small business owner. Being elected in 2007, I think he has brought something very unique to this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can only speak for myself in the way that I've had dealings with him as my deputy chair on the scrutiny of bills committee. But something that Senator Williams said in his first speech was, 'I just want to be me.' I think that, after 11 years in this place, it's very evident that that's who he was. I think that his contribution to the financial sector in this country, which has been noted in many of the contributions from other people, and, in particular, his strident determination to bring about a banking royal commission, standing out on that side of the chamber for something that he believed in, has been well noted. His driving force was in calling it out for what it was from his background in dealing with banks to understanding the issues that were confronting too many Australians in the way they were being treated by the large banks. I commend him for his contribution there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the thing that has really stood out about Wacka in this place is the amount of respect that he's had from this side of the chamber and the friends that he's made from this side of the chamber. I think it's a good story to tell, so that the people listening to this broadcast will understand that, although we come in here and we have some very strident debates—we articulate our views and we can have very different views—there are times when we have agreements across the chamber and we do that in a respectful way and we do work together on our committees. Those are where we get to know each other in a different forum than the combative nature of what the Senate chamber is only too often.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say, too, that when he's been in this place, and since he's been here, we've had some contentious issues to deal with. I have to pay respect to Senator Williams for his conviction and for living by the values of his Christian beliefs. I appreciate the respect that he has at times given to me personally in relation to sharing his views in those debates, and then there have been times when we haven't. I thank him for his contribution. He's also going to be remembered for his integrity and his courage. I think that, as a senator leaving this place after 11 years, it's a pretty good thing to go away knowing that you have the respect of people around this chamber and you're respected for your courage and your integrity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of his role as deputy chair on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, we worked together very closely. But we were having issues on that committee with government ministers not responding as quickly as the committee would have liked. It was Wacka who took it upon himself to make contact with the offices of those ministers who had been tardy in responding to our requests for further information on legislation. At times, there was legislation that was about to be debated in the Senate chamber and we wanted to ensure that senators had as much information as possible. So Wacka took it upon himself to follow up. I have no doubt there were times when some of those ministers would not have appreciated his phone call or his knock on their door, but he did that. I have to tell you that the turnaround was remarkable. So I thank him very much. I would also have to say that I'm sure that there have been times when he has been more popular on this side of the chamber than in fact he has been with some of his ministerial colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I think it was so evident in what Senator Cameron said in his contribution about the calibre of the man that John is and what he has upheld during his time here in the chamber. His devotion to his wife and his family has been commented on. I just want to wish them both the very best in the next chapter of their lives together. I know that he's going to be missed by not only me but many on this side, particularly those of us who have worked with him on committees and also in estimates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator John 'Wacka' Williams, thank you for your contribution. I only hope that when I have the opportunity to choose my time of leaving that I will have some similar comments made in relation to my contribution in this place. Thank you very much for the way you've always conducted yourself and all the very best for your future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I just wanted to, again, ever so briefly associate myself with the fine words that have been said about my colleagues Senator Williams and Senator Leyonhjelm. Both are exceptional men, as we've heard this afternoon, but those of us who've been here for a while with them knew that without having to hear it today. The number of people that Wacka had here is testament to the very high regard he is held in his community. The two of them are perhaps two of the most—apart from you and me, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall!—genuine members of parliament that I've ever had the pleasure to be associated with. Both are very true to their causes. Both have a commitment. I just want to put on record, as I've done privately and will do privately, my best wishes to both of them and my regards to their respective spouses. I wish them both all the very best in the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e4t" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  I, too, rise to associate with the comments that have been made in relation to both Senator Williams and Senator Leyonhjelm. I also take the opportunity to acknowledge the presence of Senator Fiona Nash, who was in the chamber earlier. We didn't get the opportunity to farewell Fi like we would have liked to. I place on record my acknowledgment of and my thanks for her service as a senator for New South Wales, as a minister and as a deputy leader. I'm sure that whatever Fi is doing now, particularly in the academic world, she's continuing to make a great contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we farewell two senators from New South Wales. As a senator from New South Wales, I thank them on behalf of those many people who both Wacka and David have assisted. They have served the people of New South Wales very well. They have served the people of New South Wales to the best of their ability and, as such, New South Wales has been very well served by its two senators. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Wacka first: he will be missed, and I've told him this. Everyone has talked about Wacka. He is the epitome of the 'great bloke'—a thoroughly decent person, with a sense of family values and beliefs. They are all the things that we share. We share many, many things together. Our values and beliefs are very similar. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wacka has a great sense of humour. This was especially clear to me when someone can name their chooks 'Connie' and 'Michaelia'. There is a story to Wacka naming them. He told me that his previous chooks had been named after very well-known women in the National Party, and so he proceeded to come in one day and say, 'Nancy has bought these two new chooks, and we've called them Michaelia and Connie.' I really didn't know how to take this. Of course, I was thrilled to have this chook named after me. So we proceeded for a number of years to get a frequent report on these two chooks. I was assured by Wacka that Connie laid more eggs than Michaelia. Michaelia got a little bit scratchy at times. I also had the benefit of Wacka coming down to Canberra every so often and bringing eggs that Connie had laid. Michaelia and I were very honoured to have these chooks named after us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wacka and I were able to do really good work together, especially on our inquiry into liquidators. As a former solicitor with the Australian Government Solicitor's office, I had worked extensively in the insolvency area. We were able to work very, very effectively, particularly in pursuing some of the very dodgy liquidators that we had in New South Wales. There was one in particular whom I had had dealings with when I was a government solicitor, and I must say that it was with great pleasure that Wacka and I finally extracted a degree of retribution for some of his activities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At one stage in 2009, I did a wool report. I looked at the wool industry in Australia, particularly in relation to why we sell a lot of our good wool to the Italians and then many of us buy beautiful Italian clothes in return. I told Wacka that I was doing this report on the wool industry, and Wacka said, 'Connie, I'll take you shearing so you can see what it's really like.' I thought, 'Great, this is terrific,' and so off I went to Inverell. We went out to a shearing shed out at Inverell and some fellow showed me how to shear a sheep. What was really great about that was watching Wacka—notwithstanding all the other things he had done in the interim—shear with the same degree of prowess that he had in his earlier years and him teaching me the finer points of shearing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by wishing Wacka and Nancy all the very, very best. A few years ago, I was travelling up north, having travelled through Inverell, and I rang him up at about seven o'clock one morning. I said, 'I'm about to drive through Inverell,' and so I was promptly welcomed into Wacka's home and shown around his beautiful property. I know that he and Nancy are looking forward to spending really good time together. As Wacka faces the next challenge in his life with Parkinson's, I am sure that, as a consequence of what he has done in his life, he will now become a very good advocate for Parkinson's. I'm sure that he will enjoy his retirement with his wonderful family and Nancy, in particular. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to David Leyonhjelm. It's been an absolute pleasure to know and to work with David. I enjoyed our many discussions, especially, of course, because we're both cat lovers. David had four cats and I only have one, so I did benefit from some veterinary advice as well along the way. David now has three cats, and I'm sure they'll be happy to welcome him home—along with his wife, of course!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing about David is that he always stuck to his principles. He stood for what he believed in. In this place, politicians come and go, but principles are enduring. Therefore, standing by what you value and what you believe in is very important. In the end, in the things we do, not everybody agrees with us. But if you're prepared and you stand by your principles, then people respect you more when you're prepared to stand. As Senator Scullion said, often David stood and was alone in the point of view that he put, but he was proud to do so because he was standing by his principles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure that he will continue in his quest against the nanny state. I'm sure that he will find targets—many targets—in New South Wales to address his issues with now. I wish him well. I hope he won't be too successful! I'm sure that he will continue to make a contribution to public life, whatever he does.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals and Minister for Regional Services, Sport, Local Government and Decentralisation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  Wacka: I think that what we've seen tonight is that we will all miss you. You're a true boy from the bush and a true National.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He referenced in his valedictory speech two dogs—Pistol and Boo. That reminded me of a poem by Robbie Burns that reminds me of Wacka. It's really where we hear the phrase, 'a scholar and a gentleman'. For me, Wacka is a scholar and a gentleman. He pushed against stereotypes, whilst also pretending to be one, I think, at times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wacka, in his maiden speech, referenced the scholarship he got to university, but that he only lasted three months and away he went. He's had an amazing life of driving trucks and a life on the land—as a shearer et cetera. As Nigel said, it hasn't always been easy. But the fact that John Williams from Jamestown got a scholarship to university back then points to the fact that he has a pretty good mind on him. For me, in the conversations we've had in this place, his savant-like capacity to remember facts and figures and to perform calculations at any time of day or night on the most obscure bits of information was always surprising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think he is also a gentleman, and we've heard a lot of references to that in the comments in the chamber today. He's respectful, as a gentleman should be. He respects both sides of politics, he respects the work of the Senate and its committees. He respects people. He respects the chair, and we see his longstanding efforts to see standing orders changed so that the President of the Senate would have the ability to cast out those senators who were not respectful in the chamber. And he's very respectful in the chamber. I remember often—particularly as a new senator—chatting with another colleague and being reminded by my trusty whip, Wacka Williams, that I needed to be much more respectful. Polite and respectful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's also courageous, as a gentleman should be. He did what was right, not expedient, always. For us in the Nationals, particularly when in government, he also reminded us often why we were here and who we were here to serve, and he really brought the heart into our party room. He never complained. He was always positive. He often expressed anger and frustration, I think, in equal measures and at both sides, on behalf of those people who sent him and us in our party to parliament—regional Australians. He always was a fighter. He fought for a fair go. He was incredibly courageous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think my National Party colleagues, and particularly you, Senator O'Sullivan, would agree with me on this: without doubt, of the 16 Senate whips our party's held in a century, Wacka is undoubtedly the best and the most popular. That is why he got the job more than once; he was just so good at it. He made sure we were on time, supporting our team in the chamber. He was incredibly helpful to new senators, helping us learn the ropes. One of the things he instituted as whip was compulsory fun for the Nationals. We had this regular compulsory afternoon tea straight after question time on a Wednesday. When Bozzie was around we had lamingtons, et cetera. I arrived and there was hummus, with Senator Nash there was fruit and with Senator O'Sullivan there were saveloys. We had an afternoon tea that became quite a spread. Wacka always made sure we felt like a family and that we found some time in this incredibly busy job to do something very regular and real and to connect on a very human level. He was also very good with jokes. A personal favourite was, 'Take a good look around'. I'll leave that for him to ponder on. He was always ready to make us laugh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He always supported new senators. I remember making my maiden speech on the other side a few years ago. Like he did tonight, I got quite emotional when speaking about the contribution our families make to getting us here and to supporting us in our work here. He was sitting in front of me. He clenched his teeth and, out of the side of his mouth, he said to me on that night, 'Grit your teeth, stay strong.' I appreciated that tonight he realised it's not that easy. His love for Nancy knows no bounds, and I know they're going to have a fantastic life post-politics. Also through his office of the whip, he was incredibly supportive of new staff. I'd like to pay homage to Deb, Gary and, particularly, Greg, who made any new staff member welcome and showed them the ropes. No question was too hard or a waste of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many people have talked about, Wacka was a great champion for the underdog—for those who are powerless in our society and who the big end of town have mistreated. I won't go into his work there. He also stood up for law-abiding firearm owners. We crossed the floor together on various issues over the years on that particular issue. He pushed for beef producers to have greater rights. He supported with me the inquiry into competition in the beef industry that actually saw a lot of poor behaviour, particularly by large players in the beef industry, that had a severe impact on our producers in getting a fair return for their product. He was quite a champion in that area. In competition law more generally, he always fought for changes to the Trade Practices Act, et cetera. He really fought for the underdog, and I think that is just a testament to his life experience and his tenacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know you can't wait to spend the rest of your life with Nancy. You are a truly authentic man in what increasingly is sometimes a very false environment. That's why we all delight in Wacka's turn of phrase and his capacity to say what he thinks, mean what he says and do what he says he's going to do. They're rare and traditional values that I think are getting harder and harder to find in modern life. Thank you, country boy. You are the real deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make some brief comments on Senator Leyonhjelm. As chair and founder of the Parliamentary Friends of Shooting, Senator Leyonhjelm has been a very strong advocate for law-abiding firearm owners in this country. I've appreciated both his support in the chamber and his efforts outside, and also his participation in our regular events. I extend to any senators or MPs who want to have a crack, quite literally, an invitation to our regular events throughout the year. You can come and try your hand in a safe and fun environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Leyonhjelm's dry sense of humour and his ability to look serious whilst being sarcastic will, I think, be very much missed. Senator Cameron, I think you raised a good point about the inherent contradiction of being a libertarian and up for small government whilst seeking a political career. I think that's not lost on those of us who hold similar values. Go well, Senator Leyonhjelm. Keep punching on, but not at the expense of the Nats.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  Before my time in the Senate, I was in the House of Representatives, and I've got to say that I've had more pleasure being in this chamber than I had when I was in the House of Reps. Having colleagues and associates like Wacka Williams and David Leyonhjelm, who I've worked with for the past 2½ years, has made it more pleasant for me this time around. We may not be on the same page with politics—I think a lot of the time with Wacka Williams we were, but we didn't always agree with David Leyonhjelm's civil libertarian views on taxes—I've got to reiterate the words that were just said by Senator McKenzie: Wacka Williams is a man of the earth. He's the salt of the Australian earth, someone I see as the iconic Aussie bloke out there who loves the land, loves the people on the land and will fight for them. I don't see it in a lot of other people here because of the disconnect between the city and the land, and I think the chamber's going sadly miss having Wacka here to stand up for the farming families and the people of this nation. He's a man who's out there getting his hands dirty. He knows what it's like.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Wacka has done has been absolutely wonderful. Like I said, I've only known and worked with him for the last 2½ years, but I've got to give him credit for what he's done with the banking inquiry. Wacka was the deputy chair of the Senate inquiry into rural lending to primary industries, which One Nation chaired. He was the backbone behind Malcolm Roberts in that inquiry. The information they gathered from it was very informative and has helped a lot of farming people. With Wacka you could have a joke, or he'd call across the chamber, and it wouldn't matter. It might have been a serious issue, but he could bring a smile to everyone's lips across the chamber with his sense of humour. That's going to be dearly missed. It's been an honour to work with Wacka.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With David Leyonhjelm, even today there was a motion that I put up and he said, 'Sorry, darling, I can't support you on this one.' Oh shock horror! The feminists out there are probably listening to this and saying, 'How dare you put up with that!' Forget it. Get over it. I'm not interested. I'm not offended; I take it as a compliment. That is David Leyonhjelm: still a gentleman, as Wacka is. People have become too precious in this world. You can't say or do anything without someone out there being offended by it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">David has been very, very helpful to me, because I've never been in the Senate before and it is different to the House of Reps. I've got to say that having him sitting next to me in the chamber over the period of the last 2½ years has been very helpful to me. He's sometimes guided me in how the chamber works and different things that happen here. I'm going to miss David. I think he's got a lot to offer. He's very passionate about his firearms, as I am, so on some of those issues, David, I think I might take up your cause. We'll have a talk before you finish and make sure that, if it's not settled, the challenge is taken up for the firearm owners in this country. I will carry on with that for you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do wish him all the best in the New South Wales state election, although I am standing with my candidates in New South Wales. He's taken that challenge on in his state, and, in all sincerity, I do wish him all the best. He does have a lot to offer. If anything, it's about honesty and integrity, and that's what we need on the floor of parliament. To David: all the best in the New South Wales election.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been a pleasure to have worked with both Wacka Williams and David Leyonhjelm. And I say these comments today also on behalf of my colleague Senator Georgiou.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  I'd like to rise to make a brief contribution on the legacies that both Senator Wacka Williams and Senator Leyonhjelm will leave in this place. I might start with Senator Leyonhjelm because I probably have a little bit more to say about Senator Williams as he's a colleague of mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Leyonhjelm and I started at the same time. I don't know if we were the class of 2013 or 2014. We started in 2014 but were elected in 2013. A few of us have left. Senator Rice, who I see over there, is another alumnus<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>from that year. I'm not sure if there are many more than just the three of us left at least in this place, in the Senate here. It's been a little brutal with a number of elections and a double dissolution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is going to be a loss for the Senate to see Senator Leyonhjelm go. As others have remarked, he is someone who has struck to his principles in this place, he is someone who has fought for what he believes and he is someone who represents a different point of view to many in this chamber, and that is a good thing. It helps us improve both the debate within this chamber and the discussions and deliberations outside the chamber, in committees and other forums. David does bring a unique perspective to those debates, and I've always found that he did so in good faith and with intellectual heft.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to miss some of his contributions in question time because he has a way of both putting the question in a humorous fashion and knowing, particularly for our side of politics, our sore points. He knows how to push our buttons and make life difficult for ministers on different issues. I haven't got any examples because I was trying to google some of his questions from question time—I think there was one about the GST, which was a classic—but, to this day, I still can't spell his name, so I was struggling to google those before and pull up an example. In his contribution he did say that he's proud that he's been able to always vote in line with his views. As someone within a party, I say that of course it's always easier when you're on your own. There's no doubt about that. But, as I said, the distinct perspective he brought was always useful to the chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did want to pick him up because I think he said, if I'm not verballing him, that he came into this place with a commitment not to vote for a bill that would increase taxes or increase government spending, but there was one exception to that rule, which is always the case, obviously. Minister Littleproud reminded me of it after his contribution. The National Party is very thankful for Senator Leyonhjelm's support for the Regional Investment Corporation. I know that was a bill he probably wasn't inclined to support because it's does mean extra government expenditure, in this case to help build infrastructure for farmers in our rural communities, but he did vote for it because he thought Mr Littleproud was a good bloke and he thought some of us in the National Party were good blokes. He was good enough to give his vote on that measure, and he was a good bloke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I definitely enjoyed my time serving on committees with Senator Leyonhjelm, particularly with regard to the health impacts of wind farms. We went to many areas that are impacted but often get ignored by the commentariat. I felt very pained by the dismissiveness with which some senators treated witnesses in that inquiry, but Senator Leyonhjelm, along with some other senators who are no longer here, really allowed the witnesses to have their voices heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The approach that Senator Leyonhjelm brought to this chamber—he mentioned the horse trading that you have to do sometimes as a crossbench senator; I understand that—meant he did that on a principled basis. The way he conducted himself as a crossbench senator is a template for others who may come to this place as Independents, even those with different views to David, because he stuck true to his principles while still achieving significant changes in line with his views. He did so in a way which was in good faith and respectful of others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is a nice launching pad to talk about Senator Wacka Williams, as Senator McKenzie said, another gentleman in this place. I don't think too many of us could have the galleries full like Wacka did tonight for his contribution. It's really the people who have turned up to pay tribute to him who, in my view, have best demonstrated the contribution he's made to this place. People turned up tonight because Wacka has helped them or made an impact in their lives. His contribution in this place was always centred around helping people, helping people with their problems and taking up their causes. That didn't matter if it involved taking up fights with large corporations, with the government, with ministers or whoever it might be; Wacka was a true voice for the little man in this country. He was a loud voice, a powerful voice and an impactful voice for those who don't often get their voices heard in the halls of power in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a lot of people here tonight, as I said. But I think, in fact, that he will be best remembered by a lot of the people who weren't here tonight—the victims of financial collapses. I know that a lot of them, those who he has helped to represent in that regard, would not have been able to travel to be here this evening. There is the work he's done to protect the interests of the Catholic Church from sometimes undue attacks. He's been a strong representative for them, for schools in his electorate and for the health sector—particularly around Parkinson's disease. He's fought very strongly in the last year to get extra funding for nurses there. These are things that he didn't mention tonight, but we all know them. We still bear the scars, sometimes, of the fights he's taken up on behalf of those! He's also just been a set of ears for people who have concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to relate one story that I love about Wacka and what I love about how politics is done in rural Australia. Wacka was hosting Tony Abbott once in New England. I don't think Tony Abbott was Prime Minister, I think Mr Abbott was still the Leader of the Opposition. He was up at Walcha, a sheep-grazing community—a small town in New England. Tony had come to Walcha, and as you'd expect when the opposition leader arrives he got a very good turnout. I heard that about 100-odd graziers would be there to hear from Mr Abbott. Mr Abbott's adviser, who will remain nameless—they are paid to do these jobs; no criticism of them—had come up to prepare the event for the Leader of the Opposition. He'd taken Wacka through how the event was meant to go. He told Wacka in no uncertain terms that Tony was going to say a few words, that he would not take any questions and that he'd have to go. Wacka thought this adviser was perhaps being a little too bossy. He didn't say anything other than, 'Okay, fine, fair enough.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, Tony got up and said his few words. Wacka had the microphone, turned around and said, 'Okay, any questions?' Bang—he went straight into it! That's exactly it. Tony was fine, of course, but Wacka always wanted to hear from people. That's what we're here for and that's what we're meant to do, and because he listened to people he was able to then act on their concerns and make a difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really am going to miss Senator Williams here, not just his contribution to those issues and those causes but also the friendship I know he's provided to Senator O'Sullivan and me and to others. He's the guy who always calls up and tells you to come out to dinner when you're probably working too late in this place and should get out and do something else. I'm in two minds, though, about whether I'm going to miss the Thai food or not! Senator Williams always went to the same Thai restaurant at Manuka, run by Sylvie until, unfortunately, it shut last year. It was a fantastic restaurant and it's a very big loss for Canberra, with that moving away. But it was every night; some weeks you'd have four nights in a row, bang, of moneybags. What did we have? I can't even remember now. We'd have dim sims, but it was the fish. The fish was always lovely. Wacka would always order; Wacka would know exactly what to get. I don't know how he did it, but it was beautiful food. I've probably eaten enough Thai now for the rest of my life!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, Wacka, we're going to miss you lots. I know he mentioned in his first speech that your home is not where you're born; it's where you die. He certainly considers the New England area his home, with Nancy, his lovely wife. I know he will be home now in a home that he's built and that he's very proud of. I wish him all the best in his retirement, notwithstanding the loss we have with him leaving this place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247871" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  It's patently clear that all the people who have made a contribution here today about Senator Williams have not had to sit beside him for nearly four years, co-share an office with him or, like Senator Canavan, go and eat at the same Thai restaurant three nights a week with him! As an end to that story, and I think this is a measure of Senator Williams, that restaurant did close, and so instead of him eating at Sylvie's, Sylvie started to come and eat at Wacka's. Her and her family visited Wacka up on the farm, as did most people, and had the experience up there. I think they were up there for one Christmas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of times today, as I've been listening to these wonderful contributions, I've felt like it feels when you're at a funeral and you're listening to the eulogies and you've actually got to look down at the pamphlet to see that you're at the right event—you have to check the photo! That's because it hasn't been some of my experiences where Wacka's concerned, having sat beside him. I've had to endure weather reports from up on the farm about every 15 minutes as if somehow the weather's going to change—the anticipation of rain or a change in temperature. I've had to endure every photograph ever taken by Wacka, and there are thousands of them, of the progress of the sorghum, the hay or the mung beans that he's planted. I heard Senator Fierravanti-Wells talk about the cats. I've seen all the cats, I've seen the dogs and I know why they were named. I've had to endure this for four years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't have a lot of time, but can I just say that I think everyone here recognises his strengths. I remember being at a public hearing in Townsville where there were 300 or 400 sugar farmers who were attending the hearing. We had a references inquiry, chaired by Senator Sterle, into the marketing arrangements around sugar, and I can remember Wacka opening with a question, saying, 'When I was a pig farmer,' and you could actually feel this room made up of farmers come with him. There was immediately this affinity. They'd straightened up to listen to what this fella had to say, because they knew for sure that he knew them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we had a rally here in Canberra about the setting of rates for transport workers, and Wacka was sent in to prime the crowd before the Prime Minister arrived to speak. Wacka opened with 'when I was a truck driver'. Then, on another occasion, he was a shearer. Over those five or six years I spent with him, Wacka had a lot more occupations than he confessed to in his speech today. But each of them cleverly drew on the affinity of an audience, because Wacka knew the value of trust. That's how Wacka operated. He operated his friendships on the value of trust, he operated in this chamber on the value of trust and he operated in all the inquiries that he participated in, he particularised today, on a question of trust. He is the sort of guy that people very quickly come to trust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I do know is that, of all the things that are important to John Williams—and he spoke about many of them today—his love for his family and his agrarian lifestyle are way up there at the top of the list. If there's anything anyone wants to know about Nancy, what she is thinking, what she has said, what she has bought or what she has done on the farm, just come and see me after this, because I got Nancy from daylight to dark, right here, in this spot, next to Wacka. His love for Nancy is enormous. Of course, for those who are close would know that Nancy got quite badly injured when one of those scooter things with a flag, which was being driven along the footpath, bowled Nancy over, outside of her newspaper office. So, of course, Wacka immediately launched an inquiry into these mobile scooters. I thought at the time this would be a complete waste of time and life, but in fact it turned out to be quite an important inquiry. I didn't realise how many people in the country had been exposed to that situation. That's the nature of Wacka. When he sees a problem, he'll go after it, endeavouring to try and create a solution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is very much like Senator Boswell in another way. I remember when Boswell rang me one day and said, 'You've got to stop the importation of ginger from Fiji.' I said, 'Why, Ron? ' He said, 'Because they've detected nematodes in it.' I said to him, 'What's a nematode, Ron?' because I didn't know what it was. He said: 'I don't know, but it can't be good. You've got to stop the ginger coming in.' In some ways, Senator Williams has that really primal, gut feeling about things that affect people and what the solutions need to be. He will tell you himself that he's not big on the detail of how to get from here to there. He relies on his relationships with people in this place and the staff, particularly those who support the committee process. He knows where you need to be, and he knows where the starting point is. In all the inquiries that I shared with him, he had a very disarming way in leading the witnesses and breaking down what they had to say into some plain English statements, which were always captured in the reports and which underpinned the principles of the recommendations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had quite literally thousands of hours sitting here talking with Wacka, as you do with your bench partners in this place. His conversations, apart from being dominated by the weather and the sorghum almum crop which he has just put in and which has come up one centimetre in the last hour and a half, were about his boys, his grandchildren, his wife, his livestock and his pets. They were about the people who had been affected by issues which he had taken up, and they were about his staff. He valued those relationships. They were about the people in here. He was right to say that he had made some very strong friendships across the chamber. I suspect that, with really one or two remote exceptions, Wacka would be regarded very, very favourably by everyone in the chamber. Sadly, I'm not going to be able to make that expression when my time comes to leave—and many of us won't—but it's certainly true of John Williams. Indeed, that's the experience that we have in our party room. He has a very unifying effect. Sometimes when some stresses have occurred, he was like Senator Boswell and Warren Truss before him. He was a unifying force and brought those relationships back together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So he'll be remembered fondly by many of us. He'll be missed by many. I'm not sure that we're going to see personalities like his in the future. We've been watching some trends over the last couple of decades on how people make their way to this place, and, as Warren Truss said, he's not sure that someone who didn't finish grade 7 will make it to here. I'm not sure that some burned out, old busted-arse shearer who had done a bit of truck driving and had gone bankrupt would make their way here as frequently in the future as we might have seen in the past. I suspect, I'm at time, Mr Acting Deputy President, so I thank the chamber for the opportunity to reflect on John. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  I rise this evening to speak about aged care and the state of the aged-care sector in this country. Under the leadership of the Morrison government, it's now at crisis point. It's in crisis because of an inept and incompetent government. Mr Morrison is still denying and still trying to run away from the cuts he made when he had the responsibility of being Treasurer of our country. If I looked up the definition of 'desperate' in the dictionary, I would read: 'Prime Minister Morrison'. He is so desperate he will do and say anything to hang onto his job. Mr Morrison, there's no running away from the record of cuts and chaos now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week we found out that the Minister for Aged Care, Mr Wyatt, had been sitting on information confirming the devastating impact of the Morrison government's aged-care cuts. This information sat on Mr Wyatt's desk as he repeatedly denied that Mr Morrison's cuts had had any impact on the aged-care sector. How can anyone trust Mr Morrison and the Liberals to ensure older Australians get the aged-care services that they need when they can't even get honesty from this government?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that likes to pretend they're doing more than what they are actually doing. They're all smoke and mirrors. A case in point is the government's aged-care funding and home care packages announcement over the weekend. After five years of being in office, after years of cuts, after billions of dollars have been cut from the aged-care sector, it's just too little, too late. On the eve of the beginning of the aged-care royal commission, with a federal election looming, somehow they have suddenly found a conscience and funding, but I don't believe that older Australians or their families are going be fooled. They're not going to be fooled into believing that Mr Morrison has suddenly got a conscience and cares about older Australians when he has been himself responsible for ripping billions of dollars out of the aged-care system. The government's announcement over the weekend isn't even half of Mr Morrison's aged-care cuts that he made as Treasurer.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to now turn to speak about the fires in Tasmania, my home state. I would like to put on record how much I've appreciated and respected the way that all Tasmanians have pulled together in combating these terrible, devastating fires since December last year. We know that most of those fires are under control, but we must remember there are still 20 fires continuing to burn. These fires have had a devastating and destructive impact on our World Heritage areas, local communities, infrastructure, agriculture and farming industries, natural environment, tourism industry and small businesses. My heart goes out to all those who have been impacted by the fires, but we have been fortunate that we haven't lost too many homes—one home, in fact, is too many. I'd also like to thank and to put on record my thanks for the extraordinary and unwavering efforts of all the emergency personnel, our firefighters, our SES volunteers, those employers who have allowed our SES volunteers to participate and those people who have rallied around the evacuation centres. I want to say thank you. My fellow Tasmanians, as always, pulled together in a time of crisis. To all of those who have fought and are still fighting the fires from the ground to the skies, I say thank you. To all the 175 amazing volunteers who have come to our aid from not only interstate but overseas, I say thank you. I know I thank you on behalf of all Tasmanian senators who sit in this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank the Prime Minister for his taking the time to come and visit our state during this crisis. But I'd also like to put on record my appreciation for Bill Shorten in visiting our state during this time of crisis, taking the time to go down to the Huon Valley and to be there with my colleagues Julie Collins, from the other place, and Senator Catryna Bilyk. I'd also like to associate myself with the comments earlier today by Senator Bilyk in her statement in relation to our fires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Mr Shorten said in the other place:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are all grateful and humbled by the spirit of our people, and we're humbled by their courage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow, there will be a motion moved in this Senate on behalf of all Tasmanian senators and I'm sure that it will be overwhelmingly supported by the chamber. Thank you. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:26</span>):  Tonight, we are on the cusp of a historic achievement. For the first time in years there now exists, I am pleased to inform the chamber, consensus among the majority parties of both the Senate and the House of Representatives on the need for a royal commission into the violence, abuse and neglect of disabled persons in institutional settings. Today, I put a motion before this Senate calling on the House and this chamber to express that just same view, and I am thrilled to be able to say that that motion was put with the co-sponsorship of the Labor Party and Centre Alliance and with the support of Senators Hinch, Storer and Burston. I am equally thrilled to be able to inform the Australian people that this motion now has the majority support of the House of Representatives, with members McGowan, Phelps, Bandt and Wilkie all signing on, alongside Ms Banks, indicating that they will support this motion when put before them tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a breakthrough. It has been hard fought for by disability advocates since 2015. We have spent years campaigning to bring the Labor and Liberal parties on board with this proposal. Stories have been told. Pain has been relived. Extraordinary effort has been expended. But now we have consensus. Now is the opportunity, now is the window, for both houses of parliament to express their view that there must urgently be the establishment of a royal commission to investigate the horrendous systemic abuses of disabled people in institutional care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only barrier which exists to the parliament expressing this view, a view which is held in the overwhelming majority by the Australian people, is this government's tendency to use process to avoid democratic reality. I'm sure in the next 24 hours we will see instances of this. I'm sure that there will be many occasions on which the government will try and try—and try again—to avoid the reality that they have been wrong on this issue since day one. They are wrong now and have always been wrong in their opposition to a royal commission. I urge them, I urge members of this chamber and I urge members of the House: take this evening to reconsider your position. Again and again, new evidence has come to light. Again and again, the stories of disabled people have been told in this place. It is okay to change your mind when new information comes to light. It is what mature, responsible people do. I call on the government to take that mature, responsible and moral course of action tomorrow. Join with us in passing this motion. Across the aisle, let us begin this urgently needed investigation. I thank the chamber.</span>

This morning, when I saw my colleagues here in this chamber cheering and high-fiving each other on the passage of Labor's amendments to the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018, I felt physically ill. In this chamber, MPs from the other place and this place cheered for a political victory, one that I know from personal experience will inevitably come at the cost of the lives of others. For those who cloak themselves in moral virtue, there is nothing compassionate or moral in the bill. I say to each and every one of you: you will be knowingly complicit in what happens next.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know what will happen, as I said, because I have experienced this. It is neither hypothetical nor a scare campaign. I know from experience that, to terrorists, human traffickers and people smugglers, people are simply commodities to be exploited and profited from. There is not a shred of compassion or humanity in their trade. Few other senators or members in this place have a lived experience of this; I do. As chief of staff to the Minister for Justice and Customs, I had to deal with the outcomes of the Bali bombings, the boat arrivals and the drownings. For two years, I saw the many faces and the consequences of evil, cloaked in the perversion of religion, and the commodification and exploitation of people. I saw, I heard and I smelt the consequences of this commodification of human lives. It nearly broke me and it will stay with me for the rest of my life. Fifteen years later, it still weighs heavily in my heart and on my conscience. It was then, 15 years ago, that I came to truly understand that great evil exists in this world and what it takes to protect us from it. This evil exploits compassion; it does not respect it. There is neither grace nor dignity in the exploitation and death of their victims. There is nothing to high-five or, tonight, pop the champagne corks over.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2011, after 200 boatpeople were lured to their deaths, a senator in this place is reported to have said, 'Of course not—tragedies happen; accidents happen.' But these deaths, like the other 1,000 at least, were no accident and there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that the people smugglers out there today are advising hundreds and probably thousands of people who've paid to come to Australia that they can now jump on a boat. Not a single one of these people smugglers who have taken these peoples' money and who have transited them through to countries to our north will be explaining to these people who have paid them the niceties of the contrived technicality in this bill. Of course they won't; they'll want to get them here so they can start earning some more money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say to everybody here: it won't be the senators in this place who have to recover the bloated corpses of babies and women mauled by the sharks; it will be the men and women of the Australian Border Force and the Australian Defence Force, who have had to do it twice before. It won't be journalists having to deal with the lifelong trauma of survivors. It won't be members of the House of Representatives who will be comforting our Defence and Border Force personnel who years later still wake with night terrors, reliving the horrors we knowingly inflicted on them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to all senators and members who voted for this today and their cheer squads: when the inevitable happens, don't you dare come into this place justifying your actions on the basis you did not know it could happen again. Fifteen years ago we learnt the lessons from the consequences of reopening things in 2007. You reopened our borders and the consequences and the deaths were just as foreseeable then as they are today. You can attempt to justify your actions to assuage your conscience that there was some technicality or that somehow these people smugglers were going to tell the people out there waiting to come here. I'm sorry to say that we will go through it again and you will all be equally culpable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  After five years of chaos and division, last night this government managed to provide us with something new. No, it wasn't responsible government. We are used to seeing the coalition lose control of itself. Last night it managed to lose control of the parliament as well. I know that the shenanigans in Canberra may seem a long way from Nowra or Lismore or Grafton. What we are seeing here, though, is a government that is falling apart at the seams. The coalition's inability to get its act together and govern has real consequences for the quality of representation that it provides to everyday Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition started this parliament with a majority in the lower house, and it leaves with a minority. It has lost those members as a consequence of the internal turmoil and fighting that has consumed the Liberal Party. The country is now bearing the cost of that infighting. As we saw last night, the government can't control the parliament and it has decided to cancel it. The Senate will sit just four more days between now and the election. Those lost sitting days could have been spent acting on the royal commission's recommendations to clean up financial services and banking. It could have been spent coming up with a decent climate change policy. It could have been spent coming up with ways to increase wages for ordinary Australians. But instead the government has given up on governing and has cancelled the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The chaos in Canberra has led to chaos in local electorates. How else can you explain the claims and counterclaims of bullying and intimidation that overtook the Liberal Party preselection for the seat of Gilmore? We now have seen the Prime Minister overriding local branch decision-making to install Warren Mundine, a candidate who is probably best known locally for his longstanding desire to build a nuclear power plant in Jervis Bay. How have they treated the current member? It was recently reported that the government flew the current member for Gilmore, Ann Sudmalis, back to Canberra from her UN trip to New York in fear of losing a vote on the floor of the parliament last year, making her hide in a dark office with the door locked. The electors of Gilmore deserve much better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The chaos of Canberra has also allowed local members' true nature to shine through. After the Liberal Party rolled former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last year, Mr Hogan, the member for Page, stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am making a statement of protest about the revolving door of prime ministers that has been going on for the past 10 years. I will sit on the crossbenches of the chamber and I will reserve my right to vote on bills on a case-by-case basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lofty words. What does it practically mean? Throughout all the chaos of the lost vote last night, no-one from the government ever doubted for one moment how Mr Hogan would vote. He was beside them every step of the way. If the member for Page had the courage of his convictions, he would have joined the member for Chisholm on the crossbench. Instead, Mr Hogan blinked and declared himself an independent Nationals MP—whatever that means. We know what it means. It means he's telling the people in Grafton and Coffs Harbour that he's an independent and he's telling the people in Lismore he's an independent, but to his colleagues back in Canberra he is a solid National Party vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's chaos has brought out the worst. We've seen coalition members being more concerned about their own political survival than about the national interest. This election is a chance for the electors of Gilmore and Page to change that.</span>

                  <a href="144138" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  I rise tonight to express my support for the people of Venezuela, who are currently experiencing what can only be described as a humanitarian catastrophe. As recently as 2001, Venezuela was the wealthiest country in South America. It has the world's largest proven oil reserves and was once a stable democracy with a free press and an open political system. Today the situation could not be more different. After two decades of Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro's 21st-century socialism, Venezuela can now only be described as a failed state. As of December 2018, year-on-year inflation was estimated to be 1.7 million per cent. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that this will increase to 10 million per cent in 2019. Per capita GDP is estimated to have fallen by 18 per cent in 2018, the third consecutive year of double-digit decline. This economic instability is causing profound hardship for Venezuelans, which is why more than three million people, almost 10 per cent of the population, have left the country since 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reliable statistics about the situation within Venezuela are hard to come by, but the evidence that we do have is crystal clear. Almost 90 per cent of the country now lives below the poverty line, and more than half of all families are unable to meet basic food needs. One university study found that the average Venezuelan had lost 11 kilograms in the past year. The World Bank estimates that infant mortality has increased by almost 80 per cent since 2010. A 2018 survey of 104 health facilities in Venezuela showed that 79 per cent lacked running water. When the government statistics were last released, in 2017, they showed that pregnancy related deaths had increased by 66 per cent in the previous year, cases of malaria were up 76 per cent and cases of the zika virus had risen from 71 to over 59,000 in 2015 alone. The Maduro government's response to the statistics was to fire the health minister who released them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The human rights situation in Venezuela is no better. According to Human Rights Watch, no independent government institutions remain today in Venezuela to act as a check on executive power. Chavez and Maduro have stacked the courts with political cronies, jailed their political opponents and ordered violent crackdowns on protesters. According to Penal Reform, a network of Venezuelan defence lawyers, there are currently 230 political prisoners in Venezuela. This includes the former opposition leader, Leopoldo Lopez, who is currently serving a 13-year sentence on trumped up charges from 2014. According to Human Rights Watch, the state security and armed pro-government groups, called 'colectivos', have engaged in a violent crackdown against demonstrators, and security forces have engaged in serious abuses against detainees. These include severe beatings, electric shocks, asphyxiation and sexual abuse, some of which amount to torture. In 2018, state prosecutors even used newly enacted hate speech laws to charge three children who were only guilty of voicing opposition to the government on social media. Make no mistake, this catastrophe is a direct result of the policies of both Hugo Chavez and his hand-picked successor Nicolas Maduro. From the moment that Chavez was elected he began centralising power and silencing voices of dissent. He nationalised industries, confiscated private businesses and instituted price controls. When his economic policies resulted in shortages he blamed speculators and hoarders. He stacked state industries with his cronies and used the profits of the oil boom to subsidise his pet projects. By the time oil prices fell, the economy had been so hollowed out that the once-productive industries were so crippled that nothing could prevent the catastrophe that we are now witnessing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government was right to officially recognise the leader of Venezuela's national assembly, Juan Guaido, as the interim President. Juan Guaido has a strong claim to legitimacy that rests on articles 233, 333 and 350 of the Venezuelan constitution. Although Maduro was re-elected in 2018, the election was widely considered as fraudulent. That's why Guaido has been recognised not only by Australia but also by the majority of the democratic world. We can only hope the Maduro regime heeds the call of the free world and relinquishes power so that the people of Venezuela can begin the long, slow road to recovery, as so many former socialist nations have had to do in the past.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  Today's disappointing debate on border security is a timely reminder of one of the important consequences of outsourcing our immigration policy to people smugglers. A key benefit of the coalition government's tough border security policy is that it enables an orderly humanitarian intake. To paraphrase former Prime Minister John Howard, this enables Australia to determine who comes to our country and the circumstances in which they arrive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia, one of the things I'm most particularly proud of is to be involved and interested in, and to advocate for, a number of communities of what I call 'new' Australians who have benefited from our orderly humanitarian intake. These are communities who have come to Australia, who are living in our communities and who have fled persecution, forced labour and abuse, and who have often waited their turn, in hardship, in refugee camps across Asia. These are communities who do not have the financial capacity to pay the people smugglers and who do not wish to enter our country in a manner that offends the majority of the Australian public—people they want to join with to be their fellow Australian citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This weekend in Perth I am delighted to be able to join the Perth Chin community to celebrate the Chin National Day, the 71st anniversary of Chin national identity and independence. This is a day of celebration for approximately 1.5 million Chin people who reside in the mountainous regions across Burma, India and Bangladesh. WA is the home of Australia's second-largest Chin community and I'm looking forward again to participating in their national day of celebrations, which not only celebrates their rich history but also solemnly remembers those who are not so lucky as to have found a new home in a country as welcoming as Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December just gone I had the pleasure of hosting a group of Australian Chin community leaders from Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, with international guests from the Chin Human Rights Organisation, here in our national parliament and, indeed, now their national parliament. The delegation served to remind me and the many parliamentarians that they met of how lucky we are as Australians, and that we should be constantly reminded that that luckiness is not shared by all people and that this great nation does give safe haven and a place of prosperity and security to many new Australians like the Chin community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will forever remember the brief story that was shared with me on their last evening by my friend, Boi Lin. He told his story with tears in his eyes, of fighting as a young guerrilla in the rainforests of Chin State in remote Burma, looking up at a plane flying overhead and wondering if anyone in the world would ever care for them or even knew about their struggle and the pain and suffering that their community had experienced and was experiencing. Decades later, Boi Lin couldn't believe that he was sitting in our national parliament and had been to see our national leader, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, to talk about the Chin community in Australia, the Chin community in their homeland and the Chin community that is spread throughout the world. It was truly humbling to see the effect on the Chin community and their leaders, and to understand more intimately what it meant for them to have access to authority and to have someone who listened to them and cared for their struggles and their plight; someone who was prepared to defend their interests in Australia and abroad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to attending Chin National Day celebrations like the one I will attend in Perth on the weekend, late last year, on 16 December, I also had the pleasure of attending the 11th national day of Bhutan—again, a celebration in Perth's northern suburbs. The Bhutan National Day, officially 17 December, pays respect and gratitude to the Bhutanese kings, their forefathers and past leaders who helped to build and shape today's modern Bhutan. It commemorates the day in 1907 when Gongsar Wangchuck was crowned the first king of a united Bhutan, and launched an era of peace and prosperity after a long period of civil war.</span>
