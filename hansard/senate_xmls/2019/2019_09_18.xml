                  <span class="HPS-OfficeSpeech">The PRESIDENT</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  I have a statement to make relating to parliamentary privilege. By letter dated 17 September, Senator Patrick has raised a matter of privilege concerning comments of Mr John Setka reported in the media over the past weekend. The allegation is essentially that these comments amount to an attempt to intimidate crossbench senators in respect of their votes on a fair work amendment bill currently before the parliament. Where a matter of privilege is raised, my role is to consider whether a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee should have precedence in debate. In doing so, I am bound to have regard only to the two criteria in privilege resolution 4. The first of these criteria seeks to reserve the Senate's contempt powers for matters involving substantial obstruction to Senate and committee processes or to the performance of senators' duties as senators. Any credible allegation that a person has sought to intimidate a senator to change their vote is a serious one, meeting the first of the criteria I must consider.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The second criterion, regard for the existence of any other remedy, recognises that the Senate is generally reluctant to deal with conduct as a contempt where another, more appropriate avenue for redress is available. It may be that there is an alternative remedy available in respect of the conduct reported as the foundation for these allegations. However, only the Senate can deal with allegations of improper interference with its own proceedings. Accordingly, on the basis of the criteria I am required to consider, I have determined that the matter should have precedence as a matter of privilege. The question of whether the matter should be referred to the Privileges Committee for investigation as a possible contempt is a question for the Senate itself. I table the correspondence and call Senator Patrick to give a notice of motion in respect of the matter.</span>

                </a>  Tomorrow I will ask the Senate to refer this matter to the Privileges Committee. I am hoping not just for support but for unanimous support. No-one in this chamber should ever cast a vote a particular way on the basis that, if they don't, they will be subject to abuse. The Senate must protect not only its members but the very core of democratic lawmaking. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The remarks made by Mr Setka go beyond threatening to run a campaign against Centre Alliance at the next election—an action which one would correctly characterise as 'just politics'. Rather, Mr Setka foreshadowed members of his organisation crossing paths with myself and Senator Griff at some future time and engaging in abuse. Mr Setka's comments must be considered in the context of an organisation that has a propensity, evidenced in judicial-decision reasonings in numerous cases, for regular contravention of the law and an apparent comfort with the use of coercive conduct.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As I shared with the chamber on Monday, I have been the uncomfortable and concerned witness to two CFMEU members accosting former senator Nick Xenophon at Perth Airport lounge at about the same time as the ABCC and ROC legislation was being voted on. In asking for my motion to be supported tomorrow, I put it to you that it is not something that Senator Griff or I should have to factor in when dealing with how to vote in this chamber. If we care about the integrity of the deliberations of this chamber and if we care about our deliberations being conducted free of external threat or coercion, then a very clear signal needs to be sent that this is not a situation that will ever be tolerated by the Senate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to advise the chamber that, as foreshadowed, the comments of Mr Setka have been referred to the Australian Federal Police, who are now looking into the matter. In that regard I would point out to the chamber that the elements and thresholds associated with a threat-related crime are different to the elements and thresholds associated with an attempt to improperly interfere with the free performance of any senator's duties as a senator, or an attempt to improperly influence a senator in their conduct as a senator by intimidation, force or threat of any kind.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the alleged offences stem from the same set of facts, a criminal offence and a contempt of the Senate are different matters that must be dealt with separately by different bodies. The police have no ability or jurisdiction to deal with a contempt of the Senate; only the Senate can deal with that. As such, knowledge of the referral to the police should have no influence on whether the Senate should support my referral motion tomorrow. It may influence the way the Privileges Committee approaches any contempt inquiry. Consequently, assuming a privilege inquiry does go ahead, I will ask the police to keep the committee informed of its investigations.</span>
            </p>

She stands for our liberal values of individual freedom, free enterprise, reward for effort, risk-taking and having a go, as the best way to ensure that Australians today and into the future, right around Australia, and in particular in her electorate of Chisholm, have the best possible opportunity to get ahead. Those were the values supported by the people of Chisholm and those were the values supported by the Australian people at the last election who voted for our plan to make Australia stronger and more prosperous and to ensure that Australian families have the best possible opportunity to get ahead. Australians in Chisholm and all around Australia voted against Labor's high-taxing, antibusiness, politics-of-envy, socialist agenda—a socialist agenda which Australians understood would have made our economy weaker and all Australians poorer. The member for Chisholm is a strong advocate for her constituents and a valued member of our team in this parliament. She has the government's full support.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. I thank you for your consistency. Well, what we have seen in this past week is Senator Cormann and Senator Payne refusing on seven separate occasions to assure this parliament and this Senate that one of its members, the member for Chisholm, is a fit and proper person to be in the Australian parliament. Now we have had it for the eighth time, with Senator Cormann again refusing to assure the Senate that the member for Chisholm is a fit and proper person to be in this place. In fact, he refused to talk about anything at all. Do you know what he said? 'Gladys Liu was the elected member for Chisholm.' Well, that's not an answer to the issues and questions which are being raised. He said, 'The coalition won the election.' Well, that's not an answer to the serious allegations and questions which have been raised. He said that their tax policy is better. Well, that's not an answer to issues and allegations which have been raised. In fact, there were no answers because they have none.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have nothing from the government when it comes to responding to the allegations, the concerns and the issues which are being raised publicly, including by members of the Liberal Party, about the member for Chisholm. But, as inadequate as it was, we heard a little bit from Senator Cormann. We've yet to hear anything at all in the parliament from the member for Chisholm. The Prime Minister has hit the mute button when it comes to the member for Chisholm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, and Senator Cormann continue to try and distract and claim there's nothing here to see. They're saying that we shouldn't dare, as the opposition, to ask questions about the member for Chisholm. Well, can they explain this: why is the media filled with reports that have their origins in leaks from the Liberal Party? Why is the media filled with reports that have their origin in leaks from your party, the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party? The government doesn't want to talk about that. They try to distract attention from that fact by impugning those opposite in our efforts to raise legitimate questions. But, whilst the Prime Minister is trying to project a united front, the member for Chisholm herself is yet to front the parliament. There are Liberal MPs and senators who are horrified at the Prime Minister's failure to assure the national interest. We know from what has been written publicly and what the Liberal Party members are saying privately that there are concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember how we got here. For weeks now questions have been raised over whether or not Ms Gladys Liu's connections make her a fit and proper person to be in the Australian parliament. In an effort to address those questions, the member for Chisholm gave a TV interview, an infamous interview, with Mr Bolt. The facts are that her answers in her interview simply raised more questions. So, in an attempt to deal with those questions, the Prime Minister's Office then wrote a press release that was issued in Ms Liu's name. And, when that in turn raised new questions about why her statements are so wildly inconsistent, the Prime Minister gave a press conference where he claimed that the only thing that happened was that she had given a clumsy interview. He was trying to create the impression she was a political novice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, those facts really are not supported. The member for Chisholm has been an active fundraiser and organiser for the Liberal Party for a long time. She, in fact, first ran for preselection in 2006. She was an adviser to Premiers Baillieu and Napthine, and she certainly has drawn attention over time, including running a social media campaign during the federal election in 2016, including one in relation to LGBTI Australians. She subsequently denied doing so, until faced with clear evidence. She has certainly been a prolific fundraiser. According to her preselection application, which can only have been leaked by her own colleagues in the Liberal Party, she fundraised $1 million. That's a pretty extraordinary sum for somebody outside of parliament, let alone someone in the parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> today is the latest in an avalanche of reports raising serious questions that the member for Chisholm should answer. We see again questions around a range of activities, a range of allegations—a suggestion that references, for example, for permanent residency were promised to Chinese students or overseas students. We still have silence from the member for Chisholm. I ask this question: how are people supposed to have confidence in the member for Chisholm when she won't be accountable to them and she won't even speak in the place to which she's been elected on the issues which have been raised publicly? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, as I said, it is clear there are many in the Liberal Party who simply do not have confidence in the handling of these matters by Prime Minister Morrison or the member for Chisholm. Last week, we saw a report in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>anonymously quoting one of the Prime Minister's own MPs—and I note that it is Mr Hastie's hometown paper—'There should have been concerns when she was chosen to stand as a candidate and I believe those concerns were ignored.' The <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> also reported—and this is an extraordinary allegation—that 'senior Liberals were warned by security agencies that concerns about the member for Chisholm's links to the Chinese Communist Party made it unwise to preselect her'. These are not my words. This is what has been reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span>. It was reported that security agencies had concerns such that it made it unwise to preselect her. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept, given the position I hold now and that I have previously held, that people don't discuss the advice of security agencies. But, when such an allegation is made on such a serious issue on the front page of a national and serious newspaper, it should be answered, and it should be answered by the government of the day, because it is a very serious allegation to say that the Liberal Party was warned that it was unwise to preselect her. It may be true; it may not be true; I'm not in a position to assert that. But we are in a position to know that was printed on the basis of sources obviously within the Liberal Party. And at no stage has the Prime Minister of this country responded to that allegation and at no stage has his minister representing him here responded to that allegation. That has nothing to do with her interview. It is whether or not the Prime Minister is putting his political interests ahead of Australia's national interest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Government ministers have repeatedly in this place refused to assure the parliament that the member for Chisholm is a fit and proper person to be in the parliament, and it is obvious that the member for Chisholm will not provide that assurance. As I said earlier, much of the information in the reports originates from leaks inside the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party. You can probably tell me more about this than I would know, Mr President. It is obviously a very happy place at the moment! The government is trying to distract us from that fact by impugning attempts by the Labor Party and by the media to raise legitimate questions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, shamefully, Mr Morrison has injected race into this debate. He's trying to shield himself from accountability by hiding behind the Chinese Australian community. He's suggesting that to ask legitimate questions when public concerns have been raised—not by the Labor Party but by others—is an attack on the entire Chinese Australian population. If we follow his logic, every time you're asked a difficult question it constitutes a racial smear on all Chinese Australians. Well, I'm pretty confident that that's not his view if I'm asked a difficult question or if any other Labor member who happens to be of Chinese heritage is asked a difficult question. That's not a smear on all Chinese Australians. In fact, making this about race is a really grubby political tactic and a dishonourable political tactic. It might help Mr Morrison deal with a political problem of his own making, but it certainly will not help Chinese Australians who seek to make, and are making, a contribution to this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make a comment about the diversity of the Chinese Australian community. It's a very diverse community. You have Chinese Australians who are descendants of those who came during the gold rush. There are others, like myself, who are ethnically Chinese—in my case, my father—and were born in other parts of Asia. This is the South-East Asian community: children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the diaspora from southern China into South-East Asia. There are some who are Taiwanese Australian. There are those who were welcomed by a Labor prime minister to stay in this country after the Tiananmen crackdown and there are those who have come more recently from mainland China. It is a diverse community and it is a hardworking community. It is a community that does share a love and loyalty for this country. It is also an informed community, and so many Chinese Australians can see right through what the Prime Minister is doing.</span>

As someone who has experienced racism firsthand, I object most strenuously to the way you are using it in order to divert attention from legitimate questions that even your own Liberal Party have asked about these issues. I'd make the point that the Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, is taking this approach in spite of warnings from inside his own party room. As Mr Hartcher quoted, a senior Liberal said, 'This is a profound error.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many Asian Australians who have experienced racism in their time in this country. I remember when Mr Morrison's hero, John Howard, called for cuts to Asian immigration. I remember what that meant for our community, and I remember that there were some in the Liberal Party then who stood up against it. But there were many who did not. I also remember this Prime Minister—the man who now says that you can't use race and that everything about this issue is about race—using the slur 'Shanghai Sam' 17 times, and then he misled the country and denied doing it. Really, does anyone believe him? Did you listen to him in the House of Representatives? 'I didn't hear the question.' Did anyone listen to the audio? It's as clear as a bell. And he's saying, 'I didn't use either of those phrases.' I think anyone who watched the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives saw precisely what he was doing. He got caught out. He hadn't told the truth and he got caught out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, this is the same Mr Morrison who, according to leaks out of the Liberal Party, urged the shadow cabinet to exploit community concerns about Muslim immigration. This is the bloke who's lecturing us about race. His own colleagues leaked on him and said he urged the coalition shadow cabinet to exploit community concerns about Muslim immigration. He urged the coalition to appeal to fear of immigrants. Everybody can see that this Prime Minister is seeking to avoid questions and he is using a grubby smear in order to try and avoid answering legitimate questions about the member for Chisholm. Well, we're not going to be deterred nor intimidated by this obvious distraction, and I suspect members of the media won't be. I suspect members of the community will not be. Because, ultimately, we are judged in this country not by our ethnicity or our faith, but by what we do—by our values and our actions. If one is elected as a member or senator in this place, we are accountable to the people who elect us through the parliament. That is the Westminster system. As yet, we have not had the member for Chisholm have the courage and the decency to stand up in this parliament and respond to the very, very lengthy, very serious set of allegations and concerns which have been raised about her and she should. The member for Chisholm must be accountable, and Mr Morrison should make her be so.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:55</span>):  Is it any wonder that, when the people of Australia turn on their TV and listen to the debate that goes on in this place, they are losing faith in the political system? They see a duly elected representative from the seat of Chisholm being harangued unfairly. Gladys Liu is a new coalition MP, a backbencher and a go-getter. She is a woman who is proud of her community and she's also proud of her heritage. She should be celebrated, not attacked. Over 1.2 million Australians come from Chinese heritage—over 5.6 per cent of our population—and they make a significant impact on our community and our economy. She's representing her electorate amid a media storm whipped up by those opposite, and it is a shame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've all been in robust interviews. We all, with hindsight, could have used better words. And to come in here and suggest that Ms Liu has not been upfront and has not been engaging in clarifying those statements is simply incorrect. She has issued a statement clarifying her comments, and I quote, 'At all times I've complied with relevant state and federal disclosure laws.' Those opposite haranguing her here and in the other place is as childish as it is churlish. To suggest she's been silent is, again, incorrect. She said last week she was an active member in her local community, and she works closely with many groups, including many from the Australian-Chinese community. She has resigned from many organisations and is in the process of auditing any organisations that may have added her as a member without her knowledge or consent. That is appropriate, I believe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She has the full support of the government, and, again, for those opposite to suggest anything else is misrepresenting us in this place. She's proud of her values and, as Senator Cormann said, they are Liberal Party values. She will make a great contribution to the coalition in her role as the member for Chisholm. But she flagged that this may be an issue and that it was not the first time she'd experienced something like this in her experience with the Australian public. In her first speech, she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I know some people will see everything I do through the lens of my birthplace, but I hope that they will see more than just the first Chinese woman elected to this place. I hope they will see me as a strong advocate for everyone in Chisholm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what Gladys Liu was elected to do. That is what she is doing, and she has the government's full support in representing her electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite like to say that people are dog-whistling on racism. The reality is they are the ones who are targeting Gladys because of her ethnicity, and they have form in this space. This is not the first time the ALP has pulled this card out of their poker hand. I will go to Tanya Plibersek and her attack on the Adani coalmine. Plibersek said that Australians could not rely on an Indian mining company to bring jobs to Central and North Queensland. I don't know what the Indian part had to do with it. Who could forget Michael Daley, the former leader of the New South Wales Labor Party, who said, 'The immigrants are taking the jobs and replacing fleeing young Sydneysiders running from immigrants in Sydney'? There was also Labor's racist campaign against the Chinese free trade agreement. We sat in here for days, listening to the Labor Party deride one of our great trading partners and the benefits that would flow from the Chinese free trade agreement for agricultural commodity groups, for our mining industry and for local jobs throughout our economy on the back of getting ChAFTA through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So you have form on calling out race whenever it suits you, and right now you've made a determination that criticising and haranguing Gladys Liu as the first Chinese-Australian elected to this place makes sense for you politically. Well, Gladys has the government's full support, and we look forward to the great contribution she's going to make in the other place on behalf of her constituents and, indeed, the nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  I rise to speak in response to Senator Cormann's statement. Centre Alliance supported Senator Wong's motion yesterday calling on the Leader of the Government in the Senate to provide an explanation of the government's response to allegations raised against the member for Chisholm and an assurance to the Senate that the member for Chisholm is a fit and proper person to remain a member of the Australian parliament. This is a highly unusual motion, but a very necessary one in the context of the serious allegations raised in relation to the member for Chisholm. Those allegations boil down to the fact that the member for Chisholm has been reported to have been associated with and, indeed, been a member of organisations associated with the overseas influence and propaganda activities of the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party. The member for Chisholm has denied aspects of these allegations—first in what she described as a clumsy media interview and then in a very carefully drafted statement, apparently drafted by the Prime Minister's office—but she has not been prepared to address these issues in the parliament. Allegations have also emerged about the member for Chisholm's responsibilities under the law to declare certain political donations made to the Liberal Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These matters have not been satisfactorily resolved by the member for Chisholm nor have they been resolved by the government. Instead, the government has decided to circle the wagons. Yesterday, the Leader of the Government in the Senate echoed the Prime Minister, who had declared that the government had full confidence in the member for Chisholm and then, unfortunately, accused the Labor opposition of engaging in tactics of smear and innuendo. Senator Cormann has added nothing to the discussion this morning. What should happen is that the member for Chisholm should make a comprehensive statement to the parliament addressing all allegations and issues that have been raised. What the government should do is ask the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to conduct a thorough investigation of the member for Chisholm's foreign political connections and then provide the parliament with the outcome of that investigation. Simple statements that the government has full confidence in the member for Chisholm aren't enough. It is, of course, not the ethnic background of the member for Chisholm that is the issue, not even remotely; it is her reported connections to a foreign power—a foreign power that has engaged in extensive influence and covert interference activities in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both Labor and the coalition have played partisan politics on the question of Chinese influence, and each has launched partisan attacks on the other in relation to particular individuals and cases, but we have to look at this in the wider context of China's economic and geopolitical rise, our deep trading relationship with China, the massive flow of Chinese investment into our country, the ever-growing people-to-people ties between Australia and China and the unambiguous desire of the Chinese government to directly influence our political, diplomatic and economic choices. This has been developing for a long time, and all the while we have had a series of worrying incidents that have gone inadequately investigated and haven't been resolved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A decade ago we had serious allegations raised about the member for Hunter's relationship with a Chinese-Australian property developer, Helen Liu—and, I must stress, she is no relation of the member for Chisholm. The member for Hunter was then the defence minister. Years later, it has been confirmed that Ms Liu was directly connected with a senior Chinese intelligence officer who was actively engaged in covert political funding operations. More recently, we have had the unfortunate case of former Senator Dastyari, and we now have the revelations from the New South Wales Independent Commission against Corruption of an Aldi bag stuffed with $100,000 in cash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, these high-profile political scandals are part of a wider stream of controversies concerning China's growing influence in Australia, including, for example, China's aggressive interest in Australian resources and critical infrastructure; the Chinese acquisition of Darwin's port infrastructure; the revelation that a Chinese owned mining company has been allowed to set up shop in Australia's top-secret Woomera defence testing range; concerns about China's political influence on Australian university campuses; and deeply worrying reports of extensive Chinese cyberespionage activities. The outgoing director-general of ASIO, Duncan Lewis, has called foreign interference an 'existential threat'. He didn't name China, but that's what he was talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that both the coalition and Labor are keen to fire partisan shots at each other, whether about Sam Dastyari or Gladys Liu, but they refuse to talk openly about the elephant—or, rather, the panda—in the room. Neither side wants to open debate about our future relationship with China. They are fearful of Beijing's reaction and fearful of what that might reveal about the extent of China's reach within our economy and our political institutions. Twice the coalition and Labor have voted together to block a Senate inquiry into relations with China. This week, Reuters reported that our intelligence agencies positively identified China as the source of hacking attacks on this parliament and both major political parties, but neither the government nor Labor want to talk about that. A year after the passage of our Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme, the parliament still hasn't created an equivalent parliamentary scheme. Only now has the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges been tasked to renew its inquiry on that matter, thanks to a Centre Alliance initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia can enjoy a prosperous and mutually respectful relationship with China, but only if we get our house in order and are properly insistent on respect for our sovereign democracy. In years to come, I fear we may look back on these debates and say that that was when we missed our opportunity to address issues that go to the very heart of our sovereign democracy, that that was when we failed to address an existential threat, the 'panda in the room', because our major political parties were too busy engaging in partisan spats to see the bigger picture. I very much hope those fears are mistaken, but I fear they are not.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="LNW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KENEALLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:07</span>):  I rise to take note of the minister's answer—or, at least, the complete and utter lack of one. In fact, wasn't it interesting that Senator McKenzie from the Nationals spoke longer than Senator Cormann from the Liberals in defence—well, I guess you could call it a defence—of the member for Chisholm. So we had Senator McKenzie riding in on a horse to rescue the Liberal Party from itself. What was also interesting about Senator McKenzie's contribution is that she decided one of her key planks of attack would be to cite the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement and say the Labor Party had somehow acted in some kind of racist way—I suppose that was the imputation she was making—despite the fact that it was in fact Senator Wong who carried the China free trade agreement through the Labor Party. It was a complete and utter embarrassment for the Liberals that they had to rely on the National Party in this debate. Wasn't it interesting to see how many Liberals fled the chamber when Minister Cormann had finished speaking. None of them were particularly willing—as would seem to be the case for those present here now—to stand up and participate in this take note debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three simple words that Minister Cormann, Minister Payne, and indeed, the Prime Minister, seem unable to say. They are: 'fit and proper'. They just roll off the tongue. They are not difficult to say. They are the words, in fact, that any Australian—indeed, any quiet Australian—would expect their Prime Minister to be able to say about any member of the backbench. Indeed, the only quiet Australians in this debate are members of the Liberal Party. They are unable to utter out loud the words 'fit and proper'. I would like to thank certain members of the Liberal Party who are in the chamber today for at least smiling quietly at that suggestion, as they are doing over there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why can't the government say these words? Why can't they? Why can't they simply stand up and say, 'The member for Chisholm is a fit and proper person to serve in the parliament'? Is it because they simply don't know? Do they have doubts? Are they not sure? Are they not confident enough to stand up and assert that the member for Chisholm is a fit and proper person? We read the media reports; Liberals are sharing concerns with the media that the member for Chisholm is not a fit and proper person. It must be deeply unnerving for some of those opposite to know that they helped elect someone who reportedly raised red flags with national security agencies before her preselection. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we have reports in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> that the member for Chisholm promised that she would write references for foreign students if they volunteered to work on her campaign. Those references would lead to permanent residency. The report says that, leading up to this year’s election, Ms Liu’s campaign sent WeChat messages 'offering to act as a "career referee" for Chinese students who did an "outstanding job" volunteering'. Surely this must be a concern to members of the Liberal Party and to the government. This appears to offer an inducement to a volunteer to act on behalf of a political party in an election, and it's not just any inducement; it is a significant inducement. It is the inducement to provide a character reference so someone can become a permanent resident in this country. Is this the member for Chisholm's 'visas for volunteers' program? Is the member for Chisholm, in her political campaigning, actually running a 'visa for vollies' campaign program? Is that what this is? Why can't the government, ministers in this government or the Prime Minister simply stand before the parliament, before the Australian people, and say, 'She is a fit and proper person'? It's because we keep seeing reports like this come out, day after day—national security agencies raising flags; campaign donations. Now she has to go back and run a double-check, an audit—apparently she's running it; we have no details as to how the double-checking process is working. And today there are revelations of a 'visa for vollies' scheme run by the member for Chisholm. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than put his faith in the member for Chisholm and declare her a fit and proper person, Prime Minister Morrison has instead chosen to run a straw man argument. What does he claim about scrutiny of the member for Chisholm? Despite the fact that there were reports she raised security concerns; despite the fact that there are questions around the donations she has raised, the sources of them and their links to the Chinese Communist Party; and despite the fact that she's been running a 'visa for vollies' campaign scheme, what does the Prime Minister do? He says it is racist to raise these questions. He describes this as having 'grubby undertones'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you want know what's grubby? Suggestions that the Liberal Party should exploit fears surrounding Muslim migration in order to win an election. That is what the Prime Minister reportedly did in a shadow cabinet meeting when he was shadow immigration minister in 2011. That's got grubby undertones. Do you know what else is grubby? Telling the media you're willing to waive the conditions and fast-track the visa application of a family you are deporting. Of course, I'm speaking of the Biloela family, the Tamil family. The Prime Minister was out there telling the media that, if they'd just apply, he would welcome it and, in fact, the government would make sure their visa was dealt with quite efficiently. What's grubby is that he never had any intention of doing that. Minister Dutton came out the very next day and made clear the government have no part in that. That is what is grubby. When this Prime Minister is cornered, what does he do? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not going to use the word 'lie'. But, boy, does he misdirect? Does he misrepresent? Does he just say the first thing that comes to mind that's going to get him out of that difficult situation?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what he did last week. When asked why it wasn't racist to use the phrase 'Shanghai Sam', what did the Prime Minister do? Did he answer the question? Did he tell the truth? No. He said, 'I never used that phrase.' And when video evidence emerged of him saying it, when audio evidence emerged of him saying it and when it was demonstrated quite clearly and demonstrably 17 times at least on the record that he had used that phrase, what did the Prime Minister do? It's laughable. He said, 'I didn't hear the question properly.' I mean, come on. I heard it. I am sure that all the reporters there heard it. I am sure that even Senator Cormann, had he been there, could have heard and understood it. That is what is grubby about this debate: playing the race card. That is exactly what the Prime Minister has done in his attempt to defend the embattled member for Chisholm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not take the word of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Let's not take the word even of the leader of the Labor Party in the Senate. Let's take the word of that left-leaning keyboard warrior Andrew Bolt. What did Andrew Bolt say in his column? Addressing Prime Minister Morrison, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australians are in greater danger now that you've played the race card to defend Liberal MP Gladys Liu.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to repeat that because I am not sure that the Acting Deputy President heard me. He seemed a bit distracted. Andrew Bolt said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australians are in greater danger now that you've played the race card to defend Liberal MP Gladys Liu.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So not only are all these actions grubby, they are proof of the lengths the Prime Minister is willing to go to to cling onto power. It is proof that you can take the Prime Minister out of the advertising game but you cannot take the ad man out of the Prime Minister. He is willing to do anything, say anything and promise anything. He is even willing to, in the words of Andrew Bolt, 'put Australians into a greater degree of danger' rather than to take seriously the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One TV station this week chose to call into question what the Prime Minister says compared to what he does. On Monday this week we had one TV network Channel 10 calling into question what the Prime Minister says compared to what he does. The following day the Prime Minister went ahead and did interviews with every other TV station except the one that had held him to account. This goes to show just how much this Prime Minister does not like being held to account. Every time those opposite tell Australians to 'Look away. There's nothing to see here. It's all a misunderstanding'—'Labor', 'Labor', 'Labor', 'Labor' is all that we hear from them—it's a hint that the Australian people need to examine their actions more closely. It's a question of character of the people who represent their communities in this place and their fitness to serve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now more than ever it is vital that the Australian people can have the utmost faith in the democratic institutions of this country. To claim that this scrutiny of the member for Chisholm—again, much of it arising from the alleged notification that went to the Liberal Party and much of it arising from what appeared to be the genuine concerns held by national security agencies—is racist is utterly contemptuous. It is contemptuous of the parliament, it is contemptuous of the Australian people and it is contemptuous of the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also highlight that, according to reports by many journalists in this building, the majority of concerns about the member for Chisholm are being raised by her own party. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs speak to us constantly, and rightfully so, about the threats that Australia faces from foreign interference. Over the last fortnight, we have seen a series of allegations in the media—much of it stemming, it would seem, from unnamed sources from the Liberal Party—about the member for Chisholm. And these cast genuine doubt over her conduct and raise serious questions about foreign interference. And yet when the parliament and the Australian people have looked to their government and their Prime Minister for reassurance they've got nothing. In fact, what they've got is worse than nothing. What we've heard from those opposite is contemptuous and grubby. We now know that seven times in this Senate—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator KENEALLY:</span>
                  </a>  Eight now, as the leader of the Labor Party in the Senate, Senator Wong, rightly points out. Eight times the members of this government have refused to stand here and answer the questions and say the three simple words 'fit and proper'. They cannot apply them to the member for Chisholm, and they will not say them. What faith can the Australian people have in the member for Chisholm and the government that she is part of? What we're seeing instead is a display of obfuscation and delay, a blatant refusal to do the right thing, which necessitated this motion before the chamber, and the weak, short and lack-of-detail answer that came from Minister Cormann here today. Again, I point out that Senator McKenzie, the leader of the National Party in this place, gave a more robust defence and a longer explanation than the leader of the Liberal Party in this place. I think that says it all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate, of course, has done the right thing. I acknowledge all those senators who supported this motion and called upon Minister Cormann to attend the chamber to provide an explanation for the member for Chisholm's conduct and to assure the Australian people that she should be in this parliament. Of course, we didn't get any such assurance from the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say, listening to the Prime Minister misdirect, listening to the Prime Minister play the race card and listening to the Prime Minister say and do anything to hang onto power does raise the question when we're talking about serious issues of national security and foreign interference. I think it's legitimate to ask: whose side is this Prime Minister on? Is he truly on the side of the Australian people or is he on the side of himself and his Liberal Party mates, clinging to power, hanging onto power, at any cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The questions that are being raised here are being interpreted by the Prime Minister as some kind of attempt to threaten his parliamentary majority. That's rubbish. These are questions that go to national security and foreign interference, and they should be rightly raised. If the government took questions of foreign interference and national security seriously, they would rightly answer these questions, because surely the first responsibility of a government above all else is to put the national security and the Australian interest above all else?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister and Minister Cormann owe it to the Australian people to provide an explanation for the member for Chisholm's conduct to ensure us that she is indeed a fit and proper person to serve her constituents and the Australian people in this parliament. They still haven't done so. It is extraordinary and it is contemptuous, and all it guarantees is that legitimate questions by all senators in this place, and indeed by all senators in the opposition and on the crossbench, will continue to be raised. Questions will continued to be rightly raised by the media and by the Australian people, because they go to the very heart of what it is to be a fit and proper person in this parliament. They go to the very heart of what it is to stand up and speak to and defend the national interest of the Australian people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  I can assure this chamber that Gladys Liu, the member for Chisholm, has the full confidence of the government. Ms Liu is a very proud Australian—a very, very proud Australian, indeed. She was democratically and validly elected by the people of her electorate, the electorate of Chisholm. They elected her. They stand by her. She's the member of parliament representing the 100,000 or so people in the electorate of Chisholm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Liu has made a statement in relation to the allegations about her donations and declarations, and I will read it to the chamber. Ms Liu said, 'At all times, I have sought to comply with relevant state and federal disclosure laws.' She has been very clear about accuracy in her reporting, so I think that puts to rest any accusations that her declarations have been in any way incorrect. I would also say that it's not just us in this chamber who stand by Ms Liu and have full confidence in her. The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that he stands by Ms Liu.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the personal attacks on Ms Liu that we are seeing are somewhat predictable. But I'm very keen to know what you are actually accusing Ms Liu of. In her contributions, I heard the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate accusing Ms Liu of being a party fundraiser. She accused Ms Liu of being an adviser. But this doesn't make her an experienced performer on the public stage. Ms Liu has stated quite clearly that she did a clumsy interview when she went on Andrew Bolt's show last week. God forbid anybody should stand here and say that we've all been perfect whenever we've been put on the public stage! Can anybody in this place actually stand up, hand on heart, and say that they've never done a clumsy interview? Can they say that they've never done an interview or stood up in this place and said something and thought afterwards: 'Gee, I could have said that better'? I think we all have. I can certainly say that I have on occasions thought, 'Wow, I could have put that better.' That's exactly what happened to Ms Liu last week when she went on Andrew Bolt's show.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But don't just listen to me. There are others in this building who are not on this side of the chamber who have expressed concerns about the way this issue has been handled by those opposite. There are people in the Labor Party who are particularly concerned about the way this issue has been handled in this place by the Labor Party. Simon Benson, the national affairs editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, made comment in an article last week about this very issue. He said that he understood that there was a 'raging debate' within the Labor Party about the tactics that should be used on this particularly issue, commenting that the 'lowest common denominator' appears to have prevailed. One Labor MP has apparently told Mr Benson that 'in the "thinking" ranks of the caucus there was palpable dissent' about the approach intended to be taken by the Labor Party in pursuing the backbencher Ms Liu. In fact, one Labor MP said, 'We are acting like the NSW branch of One Nation,' and I assume that that's supposed to be an insult, given the way they treat One Nation in this place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point that probably most drew my attention and had the greatest amount of resonance for me was the comment made by one of Labor's MPs, who said, 'It appears there is now no road low enough for us to make a political point.' I think we should probably stress that: even those on the other side think that the tactics are extraordinarily low. I have another comment, which probably goes very much to the direct point of why they are attacking Ms Liu. One of Labor's own said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Why it is choosing this path is a mystery to even some of Labor's own MPs who have privately expressed their disgust considering their own candidate for the same seat, Chinese Australian Jennifer Yang, has told the Liberals that she been thrown on the scrap heap by the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Is this just a front for a very sad and very sorry attempt to be very angry about the fact that Ms Liu was successful in her election in the seat of Chisholm and defeated your own candidate? If you were to consider the comments of Mr Benson in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, you would think that's exactly what it is. So what I would say to those opposite who have stood up here on two occasions and made 20-minute contributions, or thereabouts, is this: if you have any evidence, rather than continue to smear and cast innuendo over Ms Liu and her credibility and integrity, why don't you put that evidence forward? Otherwise, I think it's time for us to end this debate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  On behalf of the people of Queensland and Australia, because I am their servant, I want to take note of Senator Cormann's statement. I walk to talk about two issues, two words. The first is 'accountability' and the second is 'racism'. In regard to the first, accountability, Senator Cormann has not, in my opinion, addressed the core questions. He has failed to provide reassurances and explanations that meet the people's needs, and in that he has raised serious questions. I'm not going to continue that line of argument at the moment, though, because Senator Wong has done an outstanding job of that. I just want to point out the lack of accountability in Senator Cormann's statement. I haven't done the research, so I'm not going to continue that comment other than to point out that accountability is lacking. Having seen Martin Parkinson dodge my questions and those of the Chair of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee just adds to the lack of accountability in this house, and that undermines people's respect for the house.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the second question I am concerned about is that there have been no suggestions from the Labor Party—or from journalists, to my awareness—that Ms Liu is under pressure because of her race. That the Liberal Party and the National Party have claimed that is, in fact, saddening, disappointing and slightly annoying. There is no racism that I have seen in any comments on this from the Labor Party. But I have seen implied racism from the Liberal Party in its defence. Then we hear today that these questions are against 1.3 million Chinese in this country and that the Labor Party and others who are seeking questions answered are simply bashing the Chinese. That is false. That is clearly not part of the game. That is a tactic that the Greens often use and non-government organisation activists use when they don't have evidence—when they lack facts and lack an argument.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Playing the race card as the Liberals have done and the National Party has done only undermines their own position. We have got to stop using the race card in this country. When people can't mount an argument, they resort to lies, misrepresentations and accusations like 'misogynist', 'racist' and all the rest of it. That undermines the argument in the Liberal Party's defence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation opposes racism, opposes implicit racism and won't do that. We abhor the government for taking that stance in this case. Please come clean with the facts. That's all that people want. That's all that Australians want, because there are serious questions that the media have raised and that Andrew Bolt has raised. People in Australia just want answers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  Clearly, when we look at the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, we see a prime minister who is out of his depth on foreign policy. We saw it on full display at the G7, where he was Nigel No Mates on the phone, and what we also see is a prime minister who has failed upward his entire career. The problem, of course, is that he now has serious responsibility. He has little comprehension of that with which he is dealing. His colleagues know what it means when the most virulently nationalist and tabloid propaganda newspaper outside of North Korea praises an Australian prime minister's rhetoric. His blind repetition of the talking points of a foreign government is cause for grave concern.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Global Times</span>. Let's look at some recent articles that they've published. One is headed 'China urges US to stop malicious hyping on South China Sea'. Another is 'US bellicose stance cannot jolt China'. It goes on to talk about Huawei and divisions within the US administration. There is 'Be wary of US intervention in China-ASEAN cooperation.' We all know that China has sought to interfere in ASEAN, of which they are not a member, through initiatives in ASEAN countries. That has raised concerns about how ASEAN is going to progress. Another is 'China should hasten defence system deployment in the South China Sea: analysts'. Then they go through and quote them. You won't be surprised to know that all of those analysts believe in hastening defence system deployment in the South China Sea. Of course, we don't really consider it 'defence'. Another is, 'Xinjiang policy is justified', for an article that talks about the Uyghur Autonomous Region. But my favourite has been, 'Reuters fake report on Hong Kong is a stain on global journalism'. The article talks about the fake news on the Hong Kong government. It says:</span>

                  </a>  He has made himself useful to another government. It's not that he's been ignorant of Ms Liu. Let me tell you a story from a Victorian Liberal Party fundraiser from when the Prime Minister was the Treasurer. They were at a function and there were questions afterward. Mr Morrison had given a speech, presumably about what an excellent economic manager he's turned out to be—doubling federal government debt to more than half a trillion dollars, stagnating wages et cetera. So he'd given a speech about that. Then there was a question and answer component to the evening, and Ms Liu was there. Ms Liu repeated the Chinese Communist Party line on the South China Sea and asked Mr Morrison to validate that line. Mr Morrison afterwards asked the organisers of the function: 'Oh, is Gladys now the member for Chisholm? Is Gladys a member of the CCP?' Of course, he was only half joking. So Mr Morrison cannot claim ignorance about Ms Liu. He has known for a very long time about her disposition on these matters. But, of course—and I will come to this—Ms Liu offers something that is actually quite rare in political parties, and that is the ability to raise a lot of money. There is a real problem in that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Prime Minister, one of Mr Morrison's main purposes—other than ensuring national prosperity, which, as we can see he has totally and abysmally failed at—is to ensure national security. He sees everything through the prism of a party political prank. As the Australian Prime Minister, he has no higher duty than being our representative, and that includes representing and communicating the values of our system to the nation and to the world. He has proven himself incapable of doing so. Mr Morrison's being praised by that particular publication, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Global Times,</span> is a prize he will wear like a crown of thorns. On social media he is now being denounced as ScoMao. He is being denounced at ScoMao by Australians who are gravely concerned by his handling of Ms Liu. No wonder the Liberals don't want her to explain herself in the chamber. Mr Morrison is highly experienced—I was going to say that Mr Morrison is often referred to as 'the liar from the shire', but I won't, and I'll withdraw that immediately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:</span>  Thank you, Senator Kitching.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator KITCHING:</span>
                  </a>  But he is highly experienced at defending the indefensible. We've seen that over the course of his entire career and, in fact, before he came into politics, when he was at the tourism board. Of course, his own preselection raised many questions in the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth that we need to recognise is that Australians of Chinese descent love Australia. They love this country, they love being here and they love living here, and this is because they have a direct comparison with the way of life that they experienced as younger people. That is why they love living here. They love our freedom. They are very realistic about the government in the country from which they came, which doesn't offer its own citizens the same freedoms that they have here, although the Prime Minister seems to think otherwise—an ignorant view and a typically simplistic view from the least qualified, worst credentialed, most clueless Prime Minister on foreign policy in our history. The only thing in all of this that gives me comfort is knowing that there are many Liberal MPs who see our foreign policy and our role in the region with much more realism than the Prime Minister does. They worry about his delusional view and they worry about Ms Liu the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In amongst Ms Liu's other questionable behaviour, the latest of which we saw today, is Ms Liu offering references in exchange for being 'volunteers' on her campaign—that is, she was going to give people references if they volunteered. But do you know what Victorian Liberals have been hearing about since Ms Liu gave that interview on Andrew Bolt's program and what they are most concerned about? They are most concerned that Ms Liu has passed on electoral role or data feedback to another state actor. The people who live in Melbourne in the Chinese Australian community are concerned that their information is being passed on to the Chinese government and the CCP. And the reason they are concerned about that is that they make their own money there, and they would like to bring that money here. They have to declare how much money they are moving out of the country, and this has been recently tightened by the CCP. What has happened is they might declare that they're taking some of their money out, but, in fact, they are living in residences that are of far higher value. Those Chinese Australians are concerned that their electoral information—where they reside here—is being passed back to the CCP, and the problem with that is, of course, that a lot of these people still have family members in China and those people are in danger of being detained.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we did not pass the extradition treaty with China was that we know there is a system of collective responsibility in China. So even if they can't reach the person who is now a citizen of Australia, those people still have families back in China. And, of course, we've recently seen on some of the Australian university campuses that this has been a significant issue. Senator McKenzie talked about Ms Liu's activities in her local community and that she worked closely with the local community. That's true, and that local community is now very concerned that their private details are being shared in an inappropriate way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The creation of victimhood status around Ms Liu is unbelievable. Instead of acknowledging that Ms Liu is up to her neck in this, Mr Morrison, now with the backing of the CCP, is running interference for Ms Liu by claiming that she's done nothing wrong and that everyone is out to get her because of her ethnicity. This is patently false. As Senator Patrick has pointed out—and as I pointed out earlier in the week—there is no way that our security agencies would be passing on their concerns to a political party about a potential candidate up for preselection unless they had valid concerns. If anyone is suggesting that the former Director-General of ASIO is racist, then they are making a grave mistake. It is actually totally inappropriate for someone to suggest that our security agencies act with anything at their heart other than the very best interests of this country. They would not have made that visit lightly; they would not have done that lightly and taken that course of action lightly. They did it because they were concerned about Ms Liu.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many other concerns that people have about Ms Liu, apart from what's gone on in the past week where, firstly, she failed to declare her membership of wings of the Chinese government propaganda machine, memberships she had for over a decade. Secondly, she denied she was ever a member of them, before backflipping and saying she didn't know how her name got on these lists. Thirdly, she bragged to colleagues about raising more than $1 million for the Liberal Party, before it was exposed that large amounts of this went undeclared. And, fourthly, she then denied having to return $300,000 in donations. We also know the security agencies made contact with office holders in the Victorian Liberal Party about her nefarious associations. She was pre-selected anyway. We also know that she lobbied for the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party to ease foreign investment laws. And now we have today's story about her offering references to volunteers for her campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Mr Morrison knew all of this, because we know, from the Victorian Liberal Party, that at fundraisers Ms Liu had raised issues of Chinese foreign policy. What I would say is that the standard you walk past is the standard you accept, and we now know what Prime Minister Morrison's standards are: (1) he repeats foreign propaganda lines, not even thinking through their implications for our national security; (2) he permits his own backbenchers to raise millions from sources so dubious that they cause justifiable panic from security agencies; and (3) he falsely presents criticism as racism, despite having a history of being willing to engage in the very worst form of race-baiting himself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a Prime Minister who is turning a blind eye to a monstrous scandal, and in the process he has revealed himself to be a—I was going to say a 'dupe', but you might say that's a breach of standing order 193, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, so I will instead say he has proven himself to be ignorant of foreign policy concerns. What I would say is that you don't know what you don't know, and there are more things that will come out about Ms Liu. I will leave it there.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator HUGHES:</span>
                  </a>  The member Chisholm is a new member, a fellow member of the class of 2019. She won in an election that saw the Australian people make a clear choice for the aspirations of all Australians and reject the high tax-and-spend agenda, the politics of envy put forward by the Labor Party. She's a proud Australian and a committed Liberal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As new members we're all learning. I am sure perhaps even those that have been in this place since before I was born can think back and remember what it was like. She made a clunky, ill-worded media performance, and has perhaps not brought a full speech into the chamber. But as a senator from New South Wales, the fact that any Labor member from my state should suggest impropriety, even in this dog-whistling smear of a way, is astounding. In fact, if it were not so offensive, it would be hilarious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the party who has boosted the brand of Aldi beyond what any advertising campaign could ever do; who has members currently before ICAC, once again displaying the totally morally bankrupt culture, the 'whatever it takes' Sussex Street attitude that puts Labor not only above the law but apparently above laws that the Labor Party itself introduced. This is the party that must face incredibly awkward caucus meetings here in Canberra; the party of Eddie Obeid, now languishing at Her Majesty's pleasure; the party of Michael Williamson, now reunited with his wife after divorcing her prior to his incarceration and bankruptcy; and the party where the poor member for Kingsford Smith, during his time as state general secretary, was opposed to the elevation of now senator Kristina Keneally to the premiership of New South Wales. I guess, luckily for Senator Keneally, Joe Tripodi and Eddie Obeid could make the calls on her behalf, make the calls and move Mr Thistlethwaite's support away from Frank Sartor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'd suggest to those opposite who are smearing a hardworking member, a validly elected member chosen by the good people of Chisholm—the voters of Chisholm who rejected the party of Obeid, the party of Setka, the party of Shorten—who defeated the candidate you thought had already won the seat: have a look at yourself. Perhaps this says more about you and your disgraceful state of affairs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  As you're probably aware, Acting Deputy President Bernardi, I am in continuance from last night, when we interrupted the debate on this particular issue, the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extend Family Assistance to ABSTUDY Secondary School Boarding Students Aged 16 and Over) Bill 2019. I'm sure you were paying very close attention to that!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to refresh people's memories, the point that I have been making is that we support this particular amendment. We think it's a good way of supporting Aboriginal students as they complete their study. But during the course of the Senate inquiry there were a number of issues raised about Abstudy itself which I feel should be raised, and I had started to raise those particular issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was talking about the current application process—that it's complicated and that it acts as a potential barrier for families wanting to access the scheme. The department did articulate to us during the inquiry that there had been some changes made, and I appreciate the fact that they are making changes—I heard them—but what I also heard from the families was that the system still seems to be quite complicated for families to try and negotiate. Families felt that they didn't know how to apply or get enough support to apply and that the application process is still too difficult for families who don't have identification records, like birth certificates, for their children. I've heard on many occasions that the lack of birth certificates is a particular issue for First Nations families and people in a whole range of areas—for example, trying to obtain your drivers licence. What was put to us is that this means that some First Nations students are missing out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also misinformation about Abstudy in the community. At the inquiry, we heard from Mr Franks, who's the Chief Executive Officer of Boarding Australia Limited trading as Indigenous Education and Boarding Australia. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Out in community, there's misinformation about Abstudy: what purpose it serves, how it works, how it functions or how it doesn't function. It exists not only with families in the bush but also with community administration and with schools in the bush, and that just perpetuates itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is imperative that we undertake a full education campaign that engages First Nations communities and people so that they actually know the full facts about Abstudy and not the misinformation that's currently going around. I've heard quite a bit that the current fact sheets don't actually address it or address people's information needs. We should be engaging with remote First Nations families to ensure that they understand how the Abstudy system works and make sure that they are supported to apply. In fact, if we can simplify the system even more, that would be helpful. I did hear that the department has been trying to do that, but we also heard that it's not quite cutting it yet. So I do appreciate that people are being heard, but we just aren't getting there yet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also significant issues about how Abstudy is calculated and administered. It is acknowledged that the current level of Abstudy allowances paid to boarding schools is not enough to cover the costs of education, accommodation and day-to-day needs of First Nations students. Under the current scheme, there are always additional costs associated with education and boarding for families that need to be covered. It is clear that we need a review into the adequacy of Abstudy to ensure it meets the needs of families and students who are living away from home. We all know the difficulties faced by students and young people living away from home at critical times in their lives. It's quite difficult, particularly when you're from regional and remote communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All First Nations children deserve equal access to education opportunities, no matter where they live in Australia. I urge the government to consider the evidence raised in the inquiry and to undertake a wider review of Abstudy that examines the issues that have been raised. Having said that, we do support this particular amendment because we think it will help the retention of First Nations children at school beyond the age of 16.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>): I thank all senators for their contributions on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extend Family Assistance to ABSTUDY Secondary School Boarding Students Aged 16 and Over) Bill 2019. I particularly thank Senator Siewert for her ongoing engagement in the process of trying to make sure that we better the opportunities offered via government initiatives for our First Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is being introduced to implement a measure announced as part of the 2019-20 budget. In the budget, the government announced that it would extend family tax benefit to the families of Abstudy students who board, away from home, to attend secondary school. It intends to remove the existing perverse incentive for Indigenous boarding students to drop out of school at the age of 16. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under current arrangements, once an Abstudy boarding student turns 16, they no longer attract family tax benefit. This creates a perverse incentive for families to retain the benefit by removing their child from boarding school. This is a policy anomaly that is not aligned with supporting Indigenous students to complete year 12. Many remote communities do not have secondary schools, so boarding is frequently the only option for children to go to secondary school. However, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander boarding students are disproportionately dropping out of education at around the age of 16. Data from Human Services shows that the number of Abstudy boarding students drops by approximately 60 per cent between the ages of 15 and 17. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's 2019 Closing the Gap address to parliament emphasised that, for Indigenous students in remote and very remote areas, access to quality education can be a lifeline to future prosperity and wellbeing. This statement echoed the views of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs in its 2017 report on Indigenous education, which stressed the importance of education but found room for improvement in the support of Indigenous boarding students. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments introduced in this bill will build on the 2018-19 budget measure '50 years of ABSTUDY', which provides $38.1 million over five years to improve assistance for Indigenous secondary students who need to study away from home, including better, fairer and more flexible travel provisions and portability of Abstudy benefits if students change schools. This bill will extend family tax benefit to eligible secondary students aged 16 and over who receive Abstudy assistance to study away from home. We hope these changes will commence on 1 January 2020, subject, obviously, to the passage of this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Extending family tax benefit to Abstudy boarding students is consistent with broader tax benefit rules. It aligns with recommendations in the 2014 <span style="font-style:italic;">Forrest review</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> creating parity</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>report. The Forrest review recommended that Indigenous families with children at boarding school have access to family tax benefit until students finish year 12, in recognition of the costs incurred by families of having children at boarding school. Currently, families of Indigenous boarding students under the age of 16 are generally eligible for both Abstudy and family tax benefit. Abstudy for these students is paid directly to the school and boarding provider to cover tuition and boarding costs, and family tax benefit is paid to the family to help them with the costs of keeping the child at school. Families rely on family tax benefit to meet costs like daily incidentals while children are away at school—clothing, toiletries, medicine, pocket money et cetera—as well as living costs when they are at home during the school holidays. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once the student turns 16, family assistance legislation precludes Abstudy students from receiving family tax benefit, leaving families with no assistance for the cost of everyday essentials for their child. The loss of family tax benefit when boarding students turn 16 is a significant drop in income for support families; it can be as high as $6,900 a year. This contribution to financial pressure for families at a critical stage in a young person's education creates a disincentive for families to continue sending their child away to school and attain year 12 qualifications. If these young people drop out of school early, they are in a much, much weaker position to transition to work in adulthood. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modelling that we've undertaken using a priority investment approach shows that Abstudy students who stay in boarding school for senior school are less likely to need income support in the future. On average, within five years of leaving school Indigenous young people who study in year 11 as boarding students are projected to have income support costs that are 38 per cent lower than those of their peers who leave school earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changes introduced by this bill will mean that from 1 January—subject to the passage of the bill—families of Indigenous boarding students will stay in the family tax benefit system until their child reaches the end of secondary school. Eligible families of boarding students aged 16 and over can receive both Abstudy for school and boarding fees and family tax benefit to assist them with the costs of raising their child. These improved payment arrangements will better reflect the needs of remote Indigenous families with children studying away from home. The families of more than 2,000 Indigenous secondary school students will benefit from these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through these changes, the government is delivering an additional $36.4 million in support over the next four years. This investment will contribute to increasing the proportion of Indigenous students who complete year 12, improving their work prospects and lifetime wellbeing, and reversing the potential costs to the community that come with long-term unemployment and welfare dependency. In summary, this bill allows for the implementation of measures that will extend family tax benefit to the families of Abstudy students who need to board away from home to attend secondary school. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  This bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Members' Interests First) Bill 2019, seeks to amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 to improve the default insurance arrangements for superannuation. It aims to protect the superannuation savings of younger members and members with low-balance funds from being eroded by insurance premiums. It does this by removing the default life insurance option for these accounts. Labor supports these aims; however, it believes this bill requires some amendment in order to be able to properly achieve them without running the risk of unintended consequences.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before moving on to the substance of the bill, I want to take a moment to reflect on the path that has brought us here. When this bill was introduced into the Senate in early July, the Senate referred it to inquiry with a reporting date of mid-October. Stakeholders and experts had suggested that there were implementation issues and potential unintended consequences arising from the quite technical amendments proposed in the legislation. The long reporting time frame would have given the committee time to engage deeply with these issues and hear from those who would be affected by the bill. Instead, the government chaired and government controlled committee decided to set a closing date for submissions of 15 July, just 11 days after the bill was referred. This was an incredibly tight time frame for submitters to compile the evidence and data that was needed. Despite that, despite an unreasonable time frame, 46 submissions were received, including submissions from super funds, academics, regulators such as ASIC and APRA, and other interested parties. It is unfortunate that the government chaired and government controlled committee did not schedule public hearings to interrogate this written evidence. Instead, it resolved to report early, on 23 July.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the government has not reflected this urgency in its subsequent actions. For the past three months, the bill has just sat here as this chamber has considered other pressing matters at length, such as the Governor-General's address-in-reply, which we considered again yesterday. It's unfortunate, because it is only now, in September, that we're debating this for the first time, and the intervening period could have been fruitfully used by the committee to interact with stakeholders and fully address the issues that they have raised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues raised by stakeholders was the unreasonableness of the implementation time lines contained in the bill. The bill as drafted has an operative date of 1 October 2019, with a requirement for funds to inform their members about the changes by 1 August 2019. Those deadlines are clearly impossible now, in mid-September, but they were unreasonable even when the legislation was introduced, in early July. Requiring superannuation funds to implement the changes in the required time frame will pose significant challenges to the industry, and this is because they are technical amendments that reach right down into the individual policies that are offered through super funds to members. It takes time to work through the changes that are required, and the process is only made more complicated by the fact that these amendments will also interact with changes made through the protecting your super legislation very recently. The committee received numerous submissions from super funds explaining in patient detail the challenges involved in undertaking this body of work in such a short time frame, and their position was supported by the regulators. APRA considers that an appropriate implementation time frame would be, at minimum, six months but preferably 12 months from the finalisation of both this bill and the protecting your super legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the challenges with meeting the existing timetable is that the proposed changes will result in significant pricing revisions. These changes will not just flow through automatically. Instead, the super funds need to go away and renegotiate the group insurance contracts with their insurers. This takes time, and it will take even more time because, instead of having to renegotiate and re-sign contracts in a staggered manner as contracts come up for renewal, insurers will have to deal with super funds en masse. And all of this is at the same time that the industry is grappling with the changes flowing from the protecting your super legislation. More time is needed. More time is required to enable the industry as a whole to undertake this repricing activity and engage in negotiations with insurers. If that time is not available, there is a risk that superannuation members will bear the consequences of harsh commercial negotiations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the Labor senators on the committee recommended that the commencement of the bill be deferred. We note that the government has circulated an amendment that would delay the starting time for this legislation. Although that amendment is enough to deal with the delays in having this legislation considered by the chamber, it's not enough to deal with the substantive concerns about timing that have been raised by stakeholders. Labor has also circulated amendments that would change the implementation time lines, and we will have more to say about those amendments during the committee stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main concern that stakeholders raised, however, was the impact of this legislation on young workers in high-risk occupations. Australians have the right to expect that they come home safe and sound from a day's work. Unions have played an essential role in making sure that this is the case and continue to do so despite this government's ideological obsession with restricting the rights of working people and their representatives. Tragically, however, workplace deaths do still happen. Evidence from the ACTU is that from 2003 to 2016 more than 3,400 workers lost their lives on the job. That is a very big number. And, of those, close to 10 per cent were under the age of 25. This legislation would remove default insurance for workers under 25. The rationale is, in part, that workers under this age are less likely to have dependants and so insurance is less valuable for them and that workers under 25 are less likely to draw on their death or disability insurance. While this is no doubt correct for many of the individuals in this cohort, it is not entirely correct for young people who work in high-risk occupations. This bill, as drafted, would cancel the insurance for police officers, paramedics, construction workers, truck drivers, agricultural workers, forestry workers, prison officers, nurses and health-care workers, all of whom are at higher risk of suffering a workplace injury or, tragically, a workplace death. More than 27 per cent of workers under the age of 25 are in a high-risk job such as these. Insurance has real value for them and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been suggested that if insurance is important to these individuals they could seek individual cover themselves rather than relying on the cover provided by their super funds. The truth is that 18- to 25-year-olds are not known for their engagement with risk management. And actually, in that regard, they are similar to the rest of us: nobody likes thinking about bad things, and humans are not so great at thinking long term into the future, particularly around financial questions. The question of life insurance and the risk of suffering an accident at work or on the roads are not front of mind for young people starting out in life. Even if it were, many would find it difficult to find alternative cover.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mine Super is a fund that has 90 per cent of its members employed in high-risk occupations, and they told us in their submission that these occupations are often ineligible for retail insurance coverage and are uninsurable outside of the group insurance offering within the superannuation environment. In working in a high-risk occupation, these members have a higher chance of being exposed to a severe workplace accident and an increased probability of being off work due to illness or injury, which renders them and their dependents financially vulnerable. If our members can find insurance outside superannuation in the retail environment, the cost of insurance is often significantly higher than what Mine Super can provide. They go on to explain that they receive 800 claims per year, which represents approximately one in every 50 insured members making a claim in any given year. The ACTU likewise advises that this will cause insurance premiums to spike for those who prudently opt in as well as for existing members within the group insurance plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor listened to these stakeholders and moved amendments to protect workers in high-risk occupations. It is a shame that in the other place the government was unwilling to support those amendments. We will be seeking to have protections for workers in high-risk occupations included in this bill, and we'll have more to say about the necessary amendments in the committee stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch briefly on the gender dimension to these changes. Men and women have very different working lives. It means that many financial services laws that appear to be of general application actually have a different impact on men and women as a cohort. The government does not appear to have given this much thought in relation to this proposal, and that is entirely consistent with their longstanding hostility to undertaking gender analysis of Treasury proposals. The proposed changes will affect women differently. Women who have broken careers because of caring responsibilities would be more likely to fall into one of the categories affected by these changes. The gender gap results in a super gap, and this means that women are more likely to have a low superannuation balance. Similarly, women who take time away from the workforce to have children or to deal with other caring responsibilities are more likely to have inactive superannuation accounts because they are not working and contributing at that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women in Super provided a useful anonymised case study in their submission to the Senate inquiry. Fund A is a large industry super fund. Let's have a look at the cohorts of people in this case study affected by the government's proposal. Members under 25 pay $34 a year for their death and long-term disability income protection insurance—$34 a year. The protection is being used, a claim on this super fund is being paid out, every 12 days on average. So the capital investment, the money invested to purchase this cover, $34 a year, is being used. Every 12 days someone makes a claim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fund in question has over 177,000 active members with a balance under the $6,000 threshold. And, surprise, surprise, 75 per cent of those members with a low balance are women, because that is entirely consistent with what we know about the operation of the superannuation fund. Their average age is 36 years old, and the majority of them do have dependent children. Through the arrangements proposed, these members could lose their entitlement to over $500,000 in combined default death and long-term disability protection. In this case study, it takes these members of this fund an average of two years of working to reach a superannuation balance of $6,000, the threshold that's proposed in this legislation. It reflects the low wages in the industry that this fund services. It has 177,000 active members on low wages, and, yes, it's taken them two years to get to $6,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members risk not having proper insurance cover during the period that they are accruing this minimum balance. Like most people, the majority of these members do not have personal insurance outside superannuation and, if they did so, it would be significantly more expensive than what is made available in this fund. Due to demographic factors, many of these members never reach a superannuation balance of $6,000. This isn't dealt with in the way that this bill has been constructed, nor in the way that it's been debated by the government, and the different interests of women in our retirement system continue to be ignored by the government, as indeed do the different economic interests of women more broadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to conclude by briefing touching on the Liberals' record on super. The government has called this bill 'putting members' interests first'. It's a bit of a novelty for the Liberal Party to acknowledge that working Australians have a legitimate interest in superannuation, let alone that members' interests should be put first. Close to 24 years ago, to the day, on 25 September, the member for Warringah, Mr Tony Abbott, told the parliament:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people … The government is making us worse off now so that it will be better off in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, almost 24 years on, to the month, the Abbott government went on and struck a deal with the Palmer United Party to freeze compulsory superannuation contributions at 9½ per cent for seven years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party's war on superannuation is not a thing of the past. When this legislation was put up for debate in the other place, Liberal members of parliament were putting the case again that we should cancel those delayed superannuation increases. These are the increases which are supposed to be guaranteed by legislation and due to take place between 2012 and 2025. We heard Senator Bragg use his maiden speech in this chamber to call for superannuation to be voluntary for low-income earners. The Liberal Party seems to think the only way to increase wages for Australians is to slash their retirement entitlements. Well, in fact, there is another way. There is another way they could be approaching this. They could have a wages policy, they could have a plan to stimulate growth and productivity, they could acquire an energy policy after six years of total failure in this area and they could just get a plan to govern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party take a very different approach. We know that we can increase wages for working Australians and provide them with more superannuation. We have always stood up for the rights of workers to get a fair deal on their superannuation. It was Labor that introduced compulsory superannuation and Labor that defended it from the coalition's repeated attempts to undermine its universality. That is because we believe that every Australian deserves to retire with dignity and independence and that our superannuation system is critical to that goal.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  As I was listening to the previous contribution, I realised that this is actually my second speech in a row with a lectern. It suggests the gravity and the importance of the bill before the chamber today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Members' Interests First) Bill 2019. What a lost opportunity this legislation is. Yet again, with the help of a deal-making crossbench, this government is going to spit out a half-baked, gerried-up piece of law that doesn't fix the problem, that will leave those who can least afford it with less protection and that opens the door for their mates at the big banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current problem is that too many people, especially young people, are paying too much for insurance that they don't need. I think we all agree with that. I don't imagine any senator would disagree with this statement, but this bill does not fix the problem with group insurance provided through default super. Instead, this bill simply replaces this existing problem with another problem. The government's fix will leave other young people who do need insurance without cover. This will have a dramatic effect on people's lives. This will change the course of some young Australians' lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Costings by the Greens through the Parliamentary Budget Office indicate that, if passed unamended, this bill would see under-25-year-olds and people with low-account balances missing out on as much $5.8 billion in insurance payouts over 10 years. I accept this assumes no opt-ins, which wouldn't be the case, and this costing doesn't take into account the amendments put forward by the government today; nevertheless, it does give the Senate some sense of the magnitude of what is being decided upon today. To put it another way, this government is meddling with somewhere in the order of $600 million a year worth of payouts to young people on low incomes, who clearly need default insurance, without providing a safety net.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the fallacy of choice. The fundamental problem is that the government's bill relies on members exercising choice, even though the problem it is seeking to fix is a direct result of members not exercising this choice in the past—a conundrum. The vast majority of people do not engage with their super fund, let alone insurance in super. That's why the Howard government established that default funds should include life insurance. Through you, Acting Deputy President Brockman, I say to Senator Bragg, 'The next time you present at a young Liberal meeting, the picture of John Howard on the wall, next to the picture of the Queen, will be frowning on you. This is a legacy of the Howard government that you are trying to remove.' I will just point that out to the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the superannuation legislation amendment before us today, the choice of superannuation funds bill 2002 required to provide minimum levels of insurance in respect of death in order to qualify. That's not to say the current system is perfect, far from it. But superannuation is defined by member disengagement, which is why we have default super. And the provision of default insurance through default super should be premised on the reality that most people don't make an active choice about super, let alone insurance through super. This brings me to the key fallacy of the bill, which is to think those young people who do need insurance are likely to make an active decision more than anyone else. Senator McAllister made the point earlier that the majority of us don't necessarily engage with these choices. Indeed, it was one of the key issues raised by the royal commission and in countless inquiries that I've been on in various committees in the Senate. We have a problem with financial literacy in this country. That financial literacy causes motivational issues around people wanting to seek more information. It's a bigger issue that we have to deal with, but it is fundamentally at the heart of the problem with this bill. I invite any senator, any government senator, Senator Lambie, Senator Patrick, to explain how a 23-year-old, who's married with a couple of kids, will in the first instance understand that life insurance is even available for super and, secondly, make a decision to try and opt in to life insurance through their super. On what planet are young people with kids and a mortgage and one or two or three jobs and everything else going on in their lives going to sit down on a Tuesday night and say, 'Do you think we need to opt in to insurance in super?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be nice if we were in a perfect world and could assume that young Australians would do that, but I think we need to have a look at ourselves to understand that that's a very unlikely situation. Indeed, it's bunkum. Yet again it's a neoliberal fallacy of choice: informed consumers participating in an active market—what we economists call perfect information, a highly efficient market. It is anything but that. Indeed, I would say the fallacy is straight from the derriere of a bull. You are a farmer yourself, Acting Deputy President Brockman, but, for those who don't know what the derriere of a bull is: it's the backside of a bull.</span>

Who will win out as a result of there being less group insurance? Retail insurers; that's who. The banks and AMP might be losing super customers hand over fist, thanks to the royal commission, and here's the government once again in their corner, opening up the market for life insurance for them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't want opt-in. Another piece of this bill is straight from the back end of a bull, and that's the notion that it's simply changing default insurance from opt-out to opt-in. That's not in case. There's no guarantee that young people seeking to opt in or low-income people seeking to opt in will not be subject to individual underwriting barriers. In fact, I understand the insurance industry itself has made this clear. In other words, someone who is under 25 who wants to opt in and get life insurance may have to pay more than they're currently paying to get cover or may be refused cover altogether, yet they currently have it. Thanks to Mr John Howard, they currently have it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's some advice I received from the Parliamentary Library on this matter. 'Trustees will need to carefully consider their obligations under the insurance covenants to determine whether it is permissible for the members who would like to opt in to be included in the same pool as those who are automatically opted in. Furthermore, trustees will need to determine whether those members who choose to opt in are permitted to do so under the terms of the group insurance policy negotiated between the fund and the insurer. For example, the cost of the policy to the fund may increase as a result of select members opting in, and the trustee would need to determine whether this is consistent with its obligations under the insurance covenants. Where the trustee determines that it is not appropriate, different group insurance policies may be negotiated. Alternatively, insurers may require policies to be individually evaluated and underwritten.' The point was raised during the committee inquiry. It's the point that the government and the crossbench seem to have totally ignored.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I go to the government and crossbench amendment. So what has the government cooked up to get this bill through the Senate today? Here is a little bit of corporate knowledge not going back very far. Some may remember that it was only recently that the Greens voted with the government to get a number of significant improvements on insurance through this place, but we insisted that default insurance not be part of that legislation. I understand that the government did say at the time that their policy was to remove default insurance, and that's why we have this piece of legislation before us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an amendment apparently to cover high-risk occupations. You may think that the Greens would support this, given what I have just said here today, but it has a number of significant problems. The first problem with this amendment is that it makes a false correlation between group insurance and occupation. It does not help anyone who is not in a high-risk occupation who injures themselves or dies because of something they do outside work. I want to really labour this point about 'outside work'. It was pointed out numerous times when we debated the original piece of legislation that this default insurance is coverage for young and low-income Australians outside of work: when you're up a ladder on the weekend, when you're trying to clean your gutters. It's not for when you are in the workplace, because most workers are covered by other forms of insurance in their workplace. This amendment is kind of redundant, really, if what we're actually looking at is trying to reduce risk for young and vulnerable Australians. If you're a white-collar worker up a ladder on the weekend, this amendment is of no help to you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What kind of workers could we be talking about? Well, you could be working for the Public Service. You could be a clerk—of course, not a clerk of the Senate, as we have here in the chamber today, but someone who is generally starting out in a low-income occupation. You could be a retail worker. You could be a call centre worker. We can think of a lot of examples of people who aren't going to be covered by this amendment who are going to be vulnerable. For the Senate's interest, we did a quick calculation of the number of workers who aren't going to be covered by the amendment, and it's four-fifths of workers. Four-fifths of young, low-income, vulnerable workers as a cohort aren't going to be covered by this amendment. For a government that is intent on trying to separate the connection between your area of employment, your union and your super, this is a clumsy oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second problem is that there is currently no definition of a dangerous occupation and, moreover, super funds do not have a record of what occupation their members are actually involved in, something that certainly would be worth senators labouring in committee stage on this bill. This amendment will generate a truckload of paperwork, another thing, Senator Bragg—through you, Deputy President—you may have to bring up at your young Liberals meeting. This is significant red tape—or do we call it blue tape? It can be any colour. What about the guidance notes to board members and the minutes that are going to have to be taken to try to define and track who is working in what occupation and whether it constitutes a dangerous occupation? It is yet more complexity in a system that is already a maze, a system that is already failing, a system that we are trying to fix.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So how do we fix this problem? If the chamber is going to vote to change default super today—which is the position the Greens would like to maintain; which is a position that the Greens forced the government to adopt when the previous legislation came to this parliament—how do we put up an amendment to this bill that actually does protect all young Australians, no matter their occupation? We've got an idea that we'd like the Senate and the chamber to consider. Our amendment will nationalise group insurance for young people and low-income, vulnerable cohorts. The amendment that I have circulated would prohibit members who are under 25 and with a low account balance from being provided group insurance through default superannuation funds and, instead, establish the government as the shadow provider of insurance for these members by assessing and honouring valid claims under the same terms and conditions as would be the case if these members were defaulted into group insurance. In other words, nationalised life insurance for the excluded cohorts as provided for by this bill. There's more to this, Senator Bragg—through you, Deputy President. This would fix the problem of young people having their balances eroded, while ensuring that those who need insurance are still covered. It would also maintain the concept of universal default cover, which was Mr John Howard's idea, which is integral to the provision of affordable insurance through super.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of ways that the costs of this could be covered. What would the costs be? Just off the cuff, we note from the PBO's assessment that you'd be looking at about $600 million a year on average payouts to high-risk cohorts. That could be borne by the government or it could be provided for on a cost basis. It could be recovered through the ATO or APRA levies, and so paid for by the insurance companies themselves and either partially or fully weighted towards the affected cohort—in other words, business as usual.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would prefer to see provision of this insurance, on a risk weighted basis, at cost. It would be not for profit—no more gouging of young people by banks and insurance companies. It would be provided by the government at cost on a risk weighted basis. In other words, it could fund itself. There would be no additional cost to the government and yet we would have solved the problem. Even better than that, the at-risk cohorts wouldn't be gouged anymore, because we'd expect that the provision of this insurance through a government default scheme would be a lot cheaper for young, low-income and vulnerable Australians. Either way, it would be at a far lower cost than is currently the case for people under 25 or with less than $6,000 in super.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This position is coming from the Greens today, but I thought I'd read a quote from Mr Michael Roddan, writing in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>. I have great respect for him; he's a very, very good financial journalist. I should give a plug to his book, <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">People </span><span style="font-style:italic;">vs</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> the Banks</span>. It is a really good run-down on the royal commission and what needs to be done following that royal commission—which, of course, the Greens played a major role in getting through parliament and getting funding for.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Instead of workers sending 1 per cent of their wages to companies that show little interest in meeting their responsibilities, the money could be redirected to a national insurance scheme.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Claims could be capped at modest but suitable levels. Death policies would cover funeral costs and liabilities—to a degree—for those without dependants, and then increase depending on the spouse or the number of dependants. Income protection claims could be better regulated to reflect the reality of forgone wages in the event of an injury.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It could just provide the policy parameters, the administration, and the industry could still take on the risk—and conversely, any reward.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially, there could still be a role for the industry in the provision of that default insurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To summarise: this legislation will result in thousands of young Australians who might benefit from group insurance going without. If the government are so sure that people carved out of this bill—young people and low-income Australians—don't need insurance, then they should be prepared to underwrite their risk. I will say that again, because it makes sense. If the government and the crossbench are so sure that young people and low-income Australians, who have been carved out of this bill, don't need insurance, then they should be prepared to underwrite their risk; otherwise, this legislation is just about dismantling group insurance. And who would want to see group insurance disbanded? Follow the money trail! As I mentioned earlier, a number of big businesses would.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that most people don't pay attention to their super, let alone young people paying attention to group insurance through their super. That's why default insurance through default superannuation was established in the first place. It's a very simple principle. If passed, even with the gerry-up amendments from the crossbench, this bill will result in some of the least well-off people in our society being underinsured. This chamber will be giving assent to that today if it passes this bill. What we do here is real and has real consequences. The Greens have argued consistently that removing default insurance will impact the lives of some of the most vulnerable Australians. I urge the Senate: support the Greens amendments or don't support the bill at all.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  If I had a dollar for every time Senator Whish-Wilson says 'gouging' I would be a wealthy man. I'm glad he mentioned the word 'gouging', because gouging is what's been going on in this industry for far too long. The life insurance and superannuation sectors have been getting one of the best deals going in Australia. They have had 25 years of compulsory savings, where they have been able to consistently charge excessive insurance premiums, often for people who don't need insurance. And so the findings of the third parties, the independent people here—the Productivity Commission, the regulators and, frankly, the only groups who aren't conflicted, who are the Grattan Institute and Choice—have all said this rort and this gouging have to stop. That is why our legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Members' Interests First) Bill 2019, makes life insurance in super opt-in for people under the age of 25 or for people with balances under $6,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we're doing this is we're on the side of the workers; we're not on the side of the insurance companies. It was illuminating to hear Senator McAllister worry about what's going to happen to the insurance companies. I mean, give me a break! We are absolutely focused on trying to get a better deal for workers because, after all, the Productivity Commission has said that $1.9 billion in excess premiums have been charged in this group insurance. Over the working life for an average worker, that could be $85,000 of lost retirement savings. And, remember, the purpose of this scheme is to provide income in retirement above and beyond the age pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side are not in the business of trying to help vested interests. Senator Whish-Wilson's got some conspiracy theories about this. I wish he had expanded further; I would like to hear them. But this legislation clearly empowers people by saying that you either have to opt in or you don't have insurance if you're under the age of 25, or if you have a balance under $6,000. This is a finding of the Productivity Commission. It's been backed in by ASIC, Grattan and the Choice organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has also been through a thorough consultative process. Senator McAllister mentioned there was a truncated Senate committee process. That's because there has already been a full and detailed Senate committee process, because this has been our policy for a long time. This has been our policy to put workers before insurers and to put workers before profits of large companies, because this compulsory super scheme is about workers; it is not about insurers. And to hear the Labor Party run all these pathetic lines from the financial services industry—I have heard it all before; it's not a pretty story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen some of these life insurers run around this place with what they call the 'book of death'. The book of death is a dreadful sob story about how people won't have insurance, which, of course, glosses over the fact that in many cases workers' compensation schemes will in fact ensure that people do have coverage. But to put it beyond doubt we are proposing to move amendments which will ensure that emergency services workers do have the existing arrangements in place, as well as workers in high-risk occupations. The proposal is that that will be determined by the trustee, but within a framework. The Labor Party amendments that I think Senator McAllister foreshadowed would basically give a blank cheque to the industry to say, 'You can do whatever you want,' again, putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, we have the weight of opinion of the people who aren't conflicted. Grattan, Choice and the government's independent economics advisor, the Productivity Commission, are all saying that this enormous drain on people's retirement savings has got to stop, and that's why we're moving forward with the legislation. We are also putting additional safeguards in place to put beyond doubt any concerns that may be out there, which, at the end of the day, will put the trustee on the hook for determining whether or not people are in fact in a high-risk occupation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, people can always choose to opt in. Wherever government can avoid making decisions for people, especially to do with their financial affairs, that is a good thing. The idea that government can, frankly, enforce a set-and-forget mentality is very, very dangerous. We have seen the enormous malfeasance that's happened inside this financial services sector. We really want people to think about their financial goals, their financial future. We want people to be engaged. People should think about the sorts of insurances they want. In most cases, the group insurance in superannuation won't in fact give a family all the coverage they would need in the event of an untimely death or total and permanent disability, which could occur. So, generally speaking, it will be a retail insurance policy that will provide more coverage and more appropriate coverage for each family's needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I just want to commend the assistant minister, Senator Hume, for the exhaustive consultation process. I think there's been a lot of listening done by Senator Hume. I know that there are some very strong advocates. Some of them are not pure of heart; but some are, and so we have, I'm sure, sought to accommodate some of those concerns in these amendments.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to this important debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Members' Interests First) Bill 2019. I want to say at the outset that I do have an interest. I go back to superannuation in 1986, when there was an industrial campaign run by many unions around Australia to put in place superannuation for workers who didn't have any—nothing at all. They had no death cover, no TPD, no retirement savings at all. So that was long time prior to it becoming compulsory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take up a couple of points that Senator Bragg has made. Basically, there are a number of ways that you can further the retirement incomes of people in superannuation. You can make super be paid on time, for starters. You can make super be paid at the same time as wages. That would force people to make a contribution on time and in full, and bump up retirement incomes. You could make sure they have actually paid the right amount of super. The tax office indicates that there is about $2.7 billion worth of unpaid super, as a guesstimate. They look at their records, at what should be paid and what has actually been paid, and there is a $2.7 billion shortfall. But, no, the workers' friend, the coalition government, has decided to take a very small slice of the industry and say, 'People under 25 don't need insurance.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you think of bespoke insurance, which Senator Bragg alluded to, as being the solution for families, I'll give you a short story. Looking at my industry fund this morning, I will pay $124 worth of contributions per year for life cover of $34,000. Now, were I to go to a retail fund and try to get any insurance at my stage in life, I'd be paying a lot more than $125 a year. I'd probably be paying $125 a week. So group life insurance is not a bad thing. It is not a bad thing per se. If you take 1.2 million customers to the marketplace and say, 'Here are the assessments of death, TPD and the like; what's the best premium you can give us across 1.2 million members,' you're going to get a very competitive product. If you take 1.2 million customers individually to a retail fund, you're going to see a vastly higher premium. And there is evidence to that effect. The Rest superannuation fund will say, 'On average, you're getting insurance for life and TPD for $1.11 a week.' A comparable retail product is $8 a week. Last time I looked, that was 700 per cent more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument, simply put, by those opposite is that people do not need insurance or TPD if they're under 25. Well, that's not the world I live in. The data that Senator Hume has used is Taxation Office data which says they do not have dependants. At 25, they may not have children; that's true. But they may well have a 'better half', a partner. They may well be living with a grandparent. They could be sharing with any number of family members. In the event that something awful happens, such as death or injury, there are expenses to be met. I know this from having sat for 10 years on a claims committee, where we routinely dealt with up to 30 deaths per month, including death by suicide, misadventure and the like. Quite often, the funds that were paid out in those circumstances were the only amount available to recompense the people who paid for the funeral costs or to assist those people over that very difficult time that they were having on their life journey. I don't subscribe to the idea that this is a rip-off. In fact, if you look at the submission from Women in Super to this inquiry, you will see a case study. This is the case study:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fund A has 177,742 active members with a balance under $6,000. Approximately 75% of these members are women. Their average age is 36 years old. A majority of these members have dependents. Under the proposed changes, these members will potentially lose … $500,000 in combined default death and long-term income protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It takes members of Fund A approximately 2 years to reach a superannuation balance of $6,000 – this reflects the industry sector Fund A services, and the low wages … Like most people, a majority of these members do not have personal insurance … outside superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Due to demographic factors, 6% of members of Fund A never reach a superannuation balance of $6,000. For these members, the insurance component of their super is far more valuable than the additional retirement benefit that would have accrued—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">if they didn't have insurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The disparity between income earning potential is abundantly clear—women do it a lot tougher in superannuation than men. Time out of the workforce, lower pay, more casual work and the like means that, quite often, life insurance, TPD and the like are valuable to these women during their working career. In fact, they're not likely to get, as Senator Bragg alluded to, a funded over-pension retirement income. It's just not going to happen. It's going to be of some funds, if they're lucky, which will assist them in combination with the age pension. That's the future they're looking at, because you need to be contributing a lot more than your current level of earnings to fund your retirement over the age pension. That's exceptionally clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of people in these industry funds for whom life insurance and TPD is extremely valuable. It's a safety net. Is it expensive? No, it's not extraordinarily expensive. If you look at the largest fund which covers young people, Rest Super, they have approximately 480,000 members who will lose their insurance coverage if these changes go through as is. They maintain that the group insurance can be designed to not erode balances. For example, members at 20 years of age pay $82 per annum and get income protection benefits of $1,650 per month, a TPD benefit of $28,000 and a death benefit of $50,000. Claims are being paid. Rest alone paid $530 million in the last five years to around 3,800 members with balances below $6,000 and around $115 million to around 1,200 members younger than 25 years of age. So clearly it's not a one-way street here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bragg pointed to the Grattan Institute, CHOICE and the Productivity Commission. But the reality is that it is a really white-collar view of the world. Workers in low-paid service industries have complicated relationships—with their family and with other people around them. They may not have the two children I had at 25 years of age, but the reality is they have commitments and they are still vulnerable to shock in the event of death or TPD. I think if you ask them, genuinely and openly: 'Are you happy to pay 80 bucks a year to have this coverage?' an extraordinarily high number of people would say yes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The real problem we have here is disengagement with the industry—disengagement of workers, but not just young workers. I can point you to workers in this parliament who have been in good, high-paying jobs for a long time who haven't bothered to go and have a look at their super scheme and what it entails, what it entitles them to and how much they're paying in fees and costs. We're trying to protect the younger cohort from a diminution of their retirement through the removal of a very clear and concise benefit. I would say at the outset, having been a trustee director, having chaired an investment committee, having sat on an industry super fund board for quite a number of years, that I always acted in the best interests of members. They didn't always know I was acting in their best interests, because they never asked or they never looked or they never checked. But, when tragedy befell them or things happened and they put in a claim and got paid, they were extraordinarily thankful. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government were fair dinkum about protecting members' retirement income into the future, it would, as I say, ensure that the right amount of super is paid. The Australian Taxation Office states that it has estimated 'the difference between the value of super guarantee contributions required to be paid under the law and actual super guarantee contributions made'. For the year 2015-16, the ATO estimated the net gap—which is the gap taking into account the impact of the ATO's compliance activities—to be $2.79 billion. That is vastly more than what we're seeking to save workers from—82 bucks a year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that those on the other side would like to say that they're on the side of workers. Well, I've got a little bit of history regarding superannuation. They have opposed superannuation every step of the way. It was unions that fought for it industrially. Never forget that. Unions took the campaign to employer groups and created superannuation funds. It was the Keating government that extended that across the whole workforce. But, for about six or seven years, this was an industrial campaign—worth fighting for and delivered on the job, and people put their shoulders the wheel. Industry funds were formed. The royal commission found, in my humble view, that the retail funds were where the bulk of the problems were. If you go down this line of forcing people to opt in, you are going to disenfranchise a whole lot of people who are currently covered—they probably don't know it; I accept that. A lot of them wouldn't know it. There is a not insignificant number of people with dependants. The ATO figure is that 3½ per cent of people between 15 and 24 are living with children. Where do they go for cover? What happens to them? Do they just hope, as Senator Whish-Wilson or Senator Bragg said, that they might be covered by workers compensation? I'm not sure that that's a fair analogy at all—in fact, I'm sure it's not. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is flawed legislation. I think it is designed to move retail funds back into the picture. I can quote some interactions my office has had where a worker in a retail fund is actually paying $1,800 a month for life insurance. I won't give you the details of that fund or that person, but it's the classic retail modus operandi. The president of a football club or some sporting group is an agent; everybody knows that they're a good boy or a good girl—they look after you. You know they get a commission, because that's how they get paid. When it all unravels and you see that a person with a modest amount of money in a retail fund is actually paying more for his insurance than his entire contribution to the fund, the answer is: 'Well, he should read his fund prospectus. He should read the detail.' Workers aren't reading the detail. Retail funds are not the solution here. The solution is a careful evaluation of the real risks we're imposing on this section of the community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My contention, particularly from a transport perspective, is that young workers are vulnerable. They are vulnerable in any number of ways. They're vulnerable in accidental death and they're vulnerable in terms of intentional self-harm—and those are certainly the statistics we've seen through the years of involvement with the transport superannuation industry. To get a group life insurance cover in our area that was respectable was extremely difficult because we had a high rate of death, we had a high rate of injury and we had a disparate group of members. We had to get a collective group insurance policy that got it up. I can remember when the death cover in the TWU was $32,000. That was the best we could get, based on our claims experience. It's much higher than that now, and you can go in and purchase additional levels of cover.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What hasn't been said in this debate but should be said is that all of these group life insurance premiums are deductible. They're deductible by the funds against the 15 per cent contribution tax. There is a forward estimate of the savings that this government, or any government, will make by eliminating this cover, and they're in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's been put to me is that if you simply excise 15- to 24-year-olds and those on a $6,000 or less balance from the cover what you're quite probably going to do is increase the cover for those aged 24 to 55, 65 or 75 or whatever people work to. The savings that are going to be banked in the forward estimates may well evaporate because the group life insurance premiums for a fund—and I've been quoted this figure by one fund—will rise by 14 per cent. So the members of the fund will not see any net saving anyway. You will not be covered until 25, and when you get to 26 you're going to pay a 14 per cent higher premium. How does that make any logical sense? It only makes sense if you're batting for the retail funds and bespoke insurance, and I'm certainly not doing that. I'm batting for group life insurance for the widest possible membership at the best possible price that, in aggregate, delivers the best outcome for workers. There is a very simple test that you need to prescribe: 1.2 million members with a disparate age groups and diverse occupations going to market to get a group life insurance policy that covers the whole group versus 1.2 million people going to the marketplace and trying to deal with their individual circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At one point in my life I sought a higher level of cover. I had every medical test known to medicine, basically. I paid a doctor to write up a very comprehensive report and, after careful checking that I had no existing frailties or injuries and that I hadn't smoked for 10 years and all that sort of stuff, I was grudgingly offered a bespoke policy. That's fine. You can choose to go down that path. But we've got a system now that's not broken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are at least 3½ or four per cent of the workers in this area, by Senator Hume's own analysis, who have dependants. My question in the committee stage will be: what replaces the existing cover for those people who have dependants? The next question will be: in your forward estimates, if you're going to make some savings on tax deductibility of group life insurance premiums, have you factored in the fact that premiums may raise by 14 or 15 per cent? If they do, your savings will evaporate. They will go straight out of the window.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are early days in a very complex piece of legislation. We know from the Treasurer's remarks that there are going to be another 42 pieces of legislation coming through the economics committee. All of them will have a good testing in this chamber and all will have a result, one way or the other, and I'm happy to abide by that. I do want to put this clearly on the record: this was the first bit of legislation to come to the economics committee. It came through the selection of bills process with a reporting date of 19 October and a commencement date of 1 October for the legislation. It would be pretty hard, I would have thought, to report on a piece of legislation with an operating date 18 days before the reporting date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said to the chair, Senator Brockman: 'Can we have a hearing in Canberra? Can we get the crossbenches involved? Can we get some evidence?' 'No, we can't do that.' I said, 'Why?' He said, 'This has all been thrashed out in a previous parliament. I said, 'No, that's not exactly correct. It didn't get up in a previous parliament. The issues are still live. They need ventilating. You need to get people together and give people the opportunity to refresh themselves in this new parliament.' And we were denied that access. The government used its numbers and said: 'No hearing. It's all good—ready to go.' Well, unfortunately, that's not true.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Members' Interests First) Bill 2019. In particular after that last contribution that we had on this bill, I want to put it on the record that this is a bill about choice. This is not a bill that is stopping people from having life insurance if they want. What this bill is about is giving people the ability to choose insurance if they want to if they're in a certain cohort. What we are in effect doing is empowering people to take control of their super.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is also a bill about young people. As the youngest member of the coalition in this place and, I believe, and also the youngest member in this place if we include the opposition, it gives me great pride to speak on a bill that will have such a profound impact on young people. Being slightly closer in age to the cohort that we are talking about here, I like to think that I might have some authority to discuss in my contribution today some of the reasons why young people become disengaged with superannuation and how this bill that we're discussing today will seek to improve that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a sensible piece of reform that we're discussing today. It will allow young superannuation scheme members choice in how they take out insurance products within their superannuation and will prevent their low balances, which we know this cohort traditionally has, being eroded by fees for insurance products they may not need or want. This bill requires that insurance be provided only on an opt-in basis for members with balances below $6,000 and any new members from 1 October 2019 who are under the age of 25. And I'd like to dwell for a moment on those two important words: 'opt in'. We're not saying that young people don't need life insurance. We're not saying that young people or people with balances below $6,000 can't have life insurance. What we are doing is giving these people the choice as to whether or not they seek this product out. If you want insurance through your superannuation fund, under this bill you can choose to have it. If you don't then you won't lose hundreds of dollars a year for a product that you were automatically enrolled for when you filled out the paperwork for your superannuation scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know how important super is to Australians as they head towards retirement. From day one of your working life, you begin saving for retirement through the super contributions your employer makes on your behalf. Because super is so important, we should be encouraging young Australians to be aware of and engaged in their super choices so they can avoid excess fees and understand how their money is being invested. Yet for many young Australians their first experience of superannuation is receiving a statement from their fund showing that, after fees and insurance premiums, their balance has actually gone backwards. When that's your experience of superannuation, it's pretty easy to switch off and stop paying attention to what your super fund is doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Gallacher mentioned in his contribution just now the importance of engaging young people in super, inferring that, because young people aren't engaged with their super, that's why we need to compulsorily force these insurance products upon them, but I think that's quite counterintuitive. I think the best way to engage people in superannuation is to not gouge their fund balances out in those early years, or when it's under a certain balance, because there is no better way to disengage someone from a process or a purchase that they've undertaken than by actually taking away some of the value that they've put in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why should a young person with no children or dependants working a few shifts in a bar or supermarket every week see their super balance reduced to pay for life insurance? Yes, under current arrangements they can choose to opt out. But if you sign up for superannuation and, by default, are also signed up for life insurance, the natural assumption to make is that it's important, just as important as having a superannuation account, and that you'd be taking a risk not to have it. That's why the two products are marketed together at the same time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How many 18- and 19-year-olds do we think have the experience and the financial knowledge to fully understand what life insurance is and to assess whether they need it? I won't cast aspersions on all of the 18- and 19-year-olds in Australia, but what I will say is that when I was that age I certainly didn't have that experience or that knowledge. At the same time as these young people are signing up to super funds when they get their first job they're also trusting these funds to manage their retirement savings for the next 45 years. That's fine. But at the same time this transaction is going on, at the same time these young people are signing up, the super funds, who put themselves out as sound financial managers—after all, that's the business they're ostensibly in—in effect say to young people: 'We've also signed you up for life insurance at the same time. Trust us; it's a good deal.' The natural thing, of course, is to go along with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a huge difference though between opt-in and opt-out, and anyone who tells you otherwise is being dishonest. Everyone with an email address has had the experience of being regularly bombarded with marketing emails from hotels you once stayed at, stores you once bought something from five years ago or marketing partners of various websites you registered with just because you didn't bother to uncheck the 'Yes, I would like to receive special offers' box. Ninety-nine per cent of the time you would never have knowingly signed up for these, but in this case you were registered for it by default and five years later you're still receiving the emails because you haven't hit unsubscribe. If we don't have the time in our lives to unsubscribe from junk emails, what 20-year-old is going to sit down and research whether they need life insurance and then fill out paperwork to cancel their policy? These types of sales tactics aren't in the best interests of young Australians and people who have low incomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Default insurance required under Labor's MySuper reforms can result in members paying for cover that goes beyond their needs or paying for multiple policies upon which they can never claim. To put this in perspective, based on 2015-16 data, around 2½ million Australians who were either under 25 with a new account or with an account balance below $6,000—the cohort we're discussing today—paid an estimated $1.2 billion in insurance premiums annually.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a long list of problems with automatically enrolling young workers and low-income earners into insurance products. Indeed, the Productivity Commission found insurance is poor value for younger and low-income Australians, and estimates that insurance would erode balances for low-income workers by up to 14 per cent. Tax data shows that 96 per cent of 18- to 25-year-olds don't have dependents, and less than one per cent of people under 25 actually claim on their insurance in their superannuation. Further, it's estimated that 18- to 25-year-olds are paying more than three times the true risk based premium they should be, therefore subsidising older workers with much higher balances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Insurance premiums can reduce low-income earners' retirement balances by 10 per cent or more, compared to having no insurance, and increase with every additional set of policies that might be held by an individual. Around 20 per cent of super fund members have duplicate insurance policies across multiple superannuation accounts. That means they may not be able to claim on these policies that they're paying for, even if they do need them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One in four people don't know whether they're covered for these insurances or what they're covered for, and, honestly, it surprises me it's only one in four. Speaking of when I was a young worker going into the workforce, setting up my superannuation account, I was certainly one of that group. It demonstrates a significant amount of Australians are being signed up for something that costs them hundreds of dollars a year without knowing or without knowing why. And the Productivity Commission has reported that almost half of all super members surveyed found the opt-out process difficult or complicated. Again, I think that is an important point, going back to the metaphor of unsubscribing from emails. It's a difficult process. We know that young people are after more instantaneous processes. If it's going to take them too long to do something, they're not going to do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This list of problems demonstrates why these insurance policies should be opt-in. Through this bill the government will ensure that members who are at particular risk of account balance erosion will not have insurance provided as a default, unless they've directed otherwise. Of course, there is nothing wrong with being cautious and choosing to insure yourself against death, permanent disability or loss of income, but that should be an individual's conscious decision, particularly when they're just starting out at work or working casually and the costs of insurance premiums can exceed the amount their super fund is earning every year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill doesn't claim there is no value in insurance—though certainly some of the contributions on the other side today have suggested it does, and that's not true—and this bill also doesn't claim there haven't been occasions when the insurance offered through super schemes has been important to individuals and their families. What this bill does do is ensure that people make a conscious choice about the financial products they're signing up for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the insurance industry has been lobbying heavily against these reforms. Clearly, super funds are not a neutral voice in this debate who are only interested in the best interests of their members. After all, as I said earlier, there is $1.2 billion in insurance premiums paid by Australians under 25 on the line. We've heard a lot recently about the behaviour of the banking and financial services industry, and, in many respects, they've been found severely lacking. I would have hoped that, after the recent banking royal commission, any business in the financial services sector would be thinking twice about selling products which people don't need, don't want or don't understand and about marketing them to people in a way that they don't even know what they've signed up for and what they're paying. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case when it comes to these insurance policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it's very clear that there is wide support for these reforms, including from institutions such as the Productivity Commission, CHOICE and even the Grattan Institute, who all want to see an end to the existing arrangement of automatically enrolling people in insurance products. Fundamentally, this bill does what it describes—it puts first the interests of members, particularly the interests of young members. There are so many ways we can encourage young people to be more engaged in superannuation, and changing the rules so they can get true value out of their super, as this bill does today, is only the beginning. I urge all senators to support the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  I rise briefly to contribute to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Members' Interests First) Bill 2019, indicating that Centre Alliance will be supporting the bill along with the government amendments. Our consideration of this bill was informed in a couple of ways. One of them was the Productivity Commission's report into superannuation and associated insurances. I know that in the last parliament we fixed a number of the problems that were in play, but I remember—and I've just called it up on my iPad—that about a third of accounts, about 10 million, were unintended multiple accounts. This does include both insurance and super. These eroded members' balances by $2.6 billion a year in unnecessary fees and insurances—$2.6 billion a year that insurance companies were knowingly creaming off the pay packets of young Australians, the people who could least afford it. Senator Chandler is right in that there has been significant lobbying in this building. I've been subject to a significant amount of representation. Indeed, probably half an hour ago super industry representatives walked into my office, seeking to adjust, perhaps, what will take place in this chamber today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second factor that we considered was the needs of workers. There are a number of workers who clearly do need to have insurance and should be placed into an opt-out category. But there are many, many workers where one would argue—in fact, the Productivity Commissioner did argue—that these products weren't suitable or, indeed, were underperforming. Workers weren't being asked to pay for these products. In fact, they were just paying for them; they were never asked about them. We have worked with the government to try to find a balance to make sure that we protect workers, and that is what the amendment that the government has circulated does. We consulted with a wide range of people in respect of that particular amendment and worked very positively with the government in relation to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What that amendment does is create a pragmatic exemption for those employed in dangerous occupations, emergency service workers or those who have been deemed to have a higher level of risk. The effect of the amendment is that young people who are likely to have a superannuation balance under $6,000 and who are employed as part of the police services and forces, fire and ambulance services, coast guard or rescue services will not have their insurance cover changed. This is a safety mechanism for those young people employed in high-risk occupations that is proposed on the basis that young people don't normally give sufficient consideration to their future, and particularly their mortality. They all feel 10 feet tall and bulletproof and don't ever really consider what may happen if they were no longer around or weren't able to make a living. The bill as amended will protect the small group of people who face a higher level of risk, where accidents could result in workplace death or total and permanent disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe we've managed to find a sweet spot that balances the need to make sure that people are not automatically opted in to insurance that they don't really wish to have but are paying for. It is unusual for an industry simply to be given a free ride—the ability to simply charge people for their product without having to consult them. At no stage does this bill take away the ability of a worker to seek out and gain insurance. It carves out a particular group of people who are able to remain in the insurance without being opted out.</span>

                    </a>  Just responding to the heckling: look, if you think it's okay for people who don't need insurance to somehow subsidise people who may need insurance—we understand right now that the high-risk categories of workers will have their insurance arrangements catered for with an opt-out option. The ones that have to opt in are those who are less likely to need insurance. You shouldn't make people who don't need insurance and are not in high-risk roles subsidise people who do. The market will continue to operate, and, if indeed there is a problem in the way it operates, I'm sure the government will be open to correcting that—although I don't anticipate that. I commend the bill as amended by the government to the Senate.</span>

Labor supports the objectives of the bill to protect individuals' retirement savings from erosion, but we do have some concerns about unintended consequences regarding members in high-risk occupations, the implementation time frame of the bill and insurance premium increases and long-term impacts.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate committee received 44 submissions, including submissions from funds, insurers, APRA, the ACTU and individual unions. It's unfortunate that public hearings were not scheduled, which will be particularly clear when I relay to the Senate some of the serious concerns across remote and regional Australia. We are certainly proposing amendments to remedy the defects in this bill, including an amendment to extend the operative date to 1 July 2020 and to protect the benefits of workers in high-risk industries. Labor will always look to ensure that workers get a fair deal from their superannuation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard many different speakers, in particular from the government, on superannuation, but there have been some inconsistencies when we hear new coalition MPs come out each day with a new way to undermine superannuation. We should not be making superannuation harder. Let me share with the Senate that First Nations members continue to face significant barriers to accessing the superannuation system just as it is. These barriers are well documented, and they were further exposed during the royal commission—the royal commission that the government did not want to have. The evidence presented at the commission found that many First Nations members, particularly those living in remote communities, still have to face hurdles in meeting fund identification requirements. As Commissioner Kenneth Hayne said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples encounter needless difficulties to do with identification and about binding death nominations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, just yesterday I met with Eva Sheerlinck, the CEO of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, and Lynda Edwards, from Financial Counselling Australia. AIST were here to brief First Nations caucus members on the Indigenous Super Summit 2019, which was held in August. They also came to brief us on the Indigenous Big Super Day Out, held recently in Arnhem Land. The obstacles First Nations people face, particularly in remote communities, to accessing their superannuation and insurance and accessing the superannuation and insurance of a deceased relative are also a clear concern for these communities. People are missing out on the savings that are rightly theirs, due to identification issues—changes in phone numbers and addresses, name changes; it is very hard. It may sound like it shouldn't be hard, but think about the fact that just in the Northern Territory alone we have over 100 Aboriginal languages. We also have people whose identification is through an English name as well as their language name. Take my name, for example: Malarndirri Barbara Anne McCarthy. Malarndirri is an issue for some of the superannuation funds. Why would it be an issue? It is clearly something that many First Nations people struggle with in trying to communicate identification, whether it's with the super funds or even with the Australian Taxation Office and through the myGov system. These are issues that this Senate needs to be acutely aware of and the government needs to be aware of going forward. People are missing out on the savings that are rightly theirs due to these identification issues. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">AIST were recently in Arnhem Land for the Big Super Day out. These outreach days are organised by the First Nations Foundation, a terrific organisation connecting Indigenous Australians with lost super. They bring reps from AIST, DHS and ATO to hold outreach days in these communities, and I commend them for that work. The need, though, is absolutely huge, and I don't think the Australian parliament actually appreciates just how huge that need is out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In north-east Arnhem Land, they spoke to 400 people in four communities—Milingimbi, Gapuwiyak, Galiwin'ku and Ramingining—and they had to turn other people away, mostly due to the wait times on the phones. Some of these are just logistical matters. First Nations Foundation have already reconnected $24 million in superannuation to First Nations people. Imagine what those families could do, had they known earlier of what they could access in terms of super, for those people already living lives in disability, in poverty, on renal dialysis and needing to be able to access this. They have not been able to access it until recently. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this Big Super Day Out, they have helped 1,636 people across 21 communities in Australia. These organisations on the front line are seeing the impact that the confusion around super is having in our communities. They told us of family members trying to access the superannuation and insurance of deceased loved ones. A woman was trying to access her husband's super. He died just weeks earlier. Their marriage was described as a cultural marriage in some of the communities and the different language groups, yet they had to prove their relationship, or the wife certainly did, over the phone when trying to access his super. This is just one example of the cultural significance in making sure that there is greater awareness and interpretation with the different languages. As I said earlier, there are over 100 Aboriginal languages just in the Northern Territory alone. AIST was able to act as a third party on the phone to the superannuation fund to track down the lost super but this is not something that can always happen. They are not there in communities all the time and the financial counsellors who are there are not recognised as a third party, so the system is quite confusing and the barriers are enormously high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Indigenous super summit, delegates agreed to an action plan. Firstly, standardise the AUSTRAC Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander customer identification and binding death nomination forms. This would mean that every superannuation company would have the same forms. Think of all the different super companies there and the different forms just for those two areas—identification and the binding death nomination form. Secondly, allow financial counsellors to act as third-party representatives for members and funds, and use the financial counsellor register to give them confidence that a counsellor is a registered third party. Thirdly, partner with financial counsellors on the implementation of new processes. And, finally, as part of the action plan, work towards building an industry code of conduct. These are things which will make superannuation easier at a community level.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now go to members in high-risk industries. Labor has concerns about the unintended consequences of this bill for members in high-risk occupations. Industry Super Australia advised that nearly 30 per cent of workers under 25 years, or approximately 340,000 employees, are employed in occupations and industries that are inherently hazardous. Some industries are extraordinarily hazardous. In 2016, 50 per cent of worker fatalities occurred within the transport, postal and warehousing, and agriculture, forestry and fishing industries. We're most definitely keen to ensure that younger workers are protected from erosion of their superannuation balance at the same time as ensuring these workers in these industries have cover. Stripping police, construction workers, firefighters, transport workers and miners of their life insurance through superannuation, which may be the only life insurance they can access, is really not a reasonable step. Again, this will greatly impact on First Nations Australians, who are already facing impediments to accessing super and insurance. Construction is definitely the fastest growing employer of First Nations people in the country. Workers and their families may be faced with devastating hardship if they're unable to access life insurance in the face of a calamity. Workers who put their life on the line deserve access to affordable insurance that will protect their loved ones in cases of need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I go to some of the concerns Labor has about the time line of this bill. The time proposed—less than two months from passage to implementation—will leave thousands of Australians stuck on a phone waiting for their super funds to respond. Let me tell you, in places like Arnhem Land, the Kimberley and Cape York that puts extraordinary pressure on families, especially when they don't have the direct access that many places in southern Australia do. Industry Super Australia, on behalf of industry super funds, provided evidence of the impact. It said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the Government proceeds with the proposed changes, the implementation date is unimplementable and will result in member confusion and detriment. It is proposed that the commencement date of 1 July 2020 would allow funds to renegotiate insurance contracts on reasonable terms, make relevant system changes and properly inform members, but under no circumstances should it be sooner than 6 months after royal assent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the advice the industry super funds are giving. The government has rushed this bill through without adequate time to consider these questions. We certainly needed to have the opportunity, with a Senate inquiry, to enable people to speak directly to senators about the issues that I have raised in my speech and the issues my colleagues have raised in previous speeches in this debate. We want to support the objectives of the bill, and we will propose amendments to protect workers in high-risk industries and to allow a reasonable, but not excessive, amount of time for superannuation funds to implement these changes. I urge the Senate—I urge the government—to consider the concerns that we are raising. These are sensible amendments and we certainly ask the government to support them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="16913" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator AYRES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I want to make some comments about the detail of the proposed legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Members' Interests First) Bill 2019, and the challenges that will be faced with the implementation of it. I say at the outset there are some matters of principle involved here which ought to be front of mind for senators and front of mind for members of the community who are considering this legislation. Industry superannuation is an achievement of the Labor movement that has made a very great difference to the lives of many millions of Australians. It was hard won. It was fought for in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s with, in many cases, industrial action, detailed work with government and leadership from Australians who have made a very great contribution to the nation's future and our national savings. People like Hawke, Keating and Bill Kelty are rightly lauded publicly for the contribution they made. It was not a popular view at the time amongst employers or amongst those opposite. People over there tend to take credit for the development of the superannuation system as if they were supporters of it all along. They were not. But there were many other Australians who were involved in the building of the superannuation system—people such as Laurie Carmichael, Tom McDonald, Jenny George and Bill Mansfield. These people made an extraordinary contribution, over decades, of industrial and political leadership. With a sense of the long-term interests of workers and families, and of the nation, they delivered a system that is unequalled across the Western world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other contribution that is not often considered in the debate is the many thousands of people who, over the ensuing period, have worked hard in the industry superannuation system. The staff who worked for these organisations—the leadership of these organisations; the union officials and nominees; the employer representatives and employer nominees; and the independent representatives—who sit on these boards, have actually built a system that has integrity and decency, and delivers certainty in terms of retirement income for many, many millions of Australians and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me that what's underlying this debate—it's important for senators to appreciate—is that, while there are issues of detail and there are ideological buzzwords attached to some of this, issues like choice and some of the framework that's been adopted by the government are really a proxy for a war on industry superannuation. It's because they hate the achievement that was made by the labour movement and by millions of Australian workers. They can't bring themselves to accept that it's now a mainstream, crucial condition for a future retirement strategy for millions of people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two objectives that we're dealing with here in superannuation are, firstly, retirement incomes and, secondly, the capacity of the superannuation system to use its scale to deliver low-price, effective insurance products for Australian workers and their families. I just don't buy for a second the student-politics obsession that underlines the drive to wreck the superannuation system that's coming from senators opposite, who will never have to worry about their own retirement incomes and who will never be in a position where they need a superannuation system that's got scale and support across the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 to improve the default insurance arrangements for superannuation. It aims, it claims, to protect the superannuation savings of younger members and members with low-balance funds from being eroded by insurance premiums. It does this by removing the default life insurance option for these accounts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor support this aim. However, we believe that the bill requires some amendment in order to be able to properly achieve those objectives without what we see at this stage as unintended consequences, although unintended consequences does presuppose that the actual intent of the senators opposite is benign and actually supportive of the future operation of an effective, decent superannuation system. I suspect that what they're actually about is their mates in the retail super system. They're opposed to the existence and the effectiveness of the industry superannuation system, and they will do whatever they can in this place and in the other chamber to undermine those objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this bill was introduced into the Senate in early July, the Senate referred it to a committee inquiry with a reporting date of mid-October. Stakeholders and experts had suggested that there were implementation issues and potential unintended consequences arising from the quite technical amendments proposed in the legislation. The long reporting timetable would have given the committee the time to engage deeply with these issues, to hear from those affected by the bill and to actually take evidence from experts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, the government-chaired and government-controlled committee decided to set a closing date for submissions of 15 July; just 11 days after the bill was referred. Just imagine: a trillion-dollar superannuation system, major changes that affect the operation and governance of the system, and the answer of the characters opposite is 11 days for the industry to consider the impact of the legislation. You would only do that if you didn't care. You would only do that if your real objective was creating as much chaos in the system as was possible. It was an incredibly tight time line for submitters, and I think that was—</span>

As usual, I'm taking the opportunity to speak about my favourite topic—that is, the state of Tasmania. I would go so far as to venture that this is the best part of our country. I think I can see Senator Urquhart agreeing with me and Senator Whish-Wilson too, noting there are some great Tasmanians occupying seats in this place and working very hard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will start by talking about the bushfires that affected quite a swathe of Tasmania's wilderness areas earlier in the year. In doing so, we should acknowledge those who are currently battling the severe fire danger conditions around other parts of the country, in New South Wales and Queensland in particular, and spare a thought for them and what they're going through. In Tasmania, some beautiful parts of our state were destroyed. One of those areas was in the Huon Valley in Tasmania's south, south of Hobart. It is a beautiful part of the world and is home to some great industries like the aquaculture industry and a number of others. Those bushfires had an impact on visitor numbers, particularly as we were heading into the winter months, a period of time when tourism businesses and the like struggle to attract as many patrons as they would perhaps in the summer months. That being the case, after some very, very energetic lobbying from the mayor of Huon Valley, Bec Enders, who is a terrific advocate for that community, and the state government, led by Will Hodgman, who is one of the local members for that neck of the woods, there was a call for support to ensure that we would be able to make sure that there were tourism offerings in place to support this community, to support the visitor economy, particularly after the Tahune AirWalk in the Huon Valley was damaged, with the great swathes of wilderness area being damaged affecting impacting on visitor numbers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government committed $1.5 million to support a tourist attraction, an art installation known as part of Project X, which is run by the team from DarkLab, led by a very innovative local, Leigh Carmichael, who does great work on behalf of the MONA institute in Hobart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Project X, a series of art installations—some of them weird, some of them wacky, many of them wonderful—will do great things in attracting visitors to these regional communities. I was able to unveil one, <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Aftermath Dislocation Principle</span>, which is a 40-foot shipping container with peepholes in the sides of it. Inside is a wonderful diorama of a community that's been impacted by some sort of apocalyptic event. The amount of detail that went into this made it one of the most popular attractions at the Dark Mofo winter festival in Tasmania earlier this year. I'm told by local business owners and members of the community in Geeveston, where the installation currently is, that it's brought crowds out to see this wonderful thing. They are shopping in local businesses and supporting that economy, which is what this project, supported by the Morrison government to the tune of $1.5 million, was supposed to do. I am pleased to have been a part of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the five weeks that we were not in Canberra—a wonderful place not to be—the Morrison government was doing good things for the people of Tasmania. It was an absolute pleasure to be with the Minister for Housing, Michael Sukkar, and the Tasmanian Minister for Housing, Roger Jaensch, to welcome the announcement that Tasmania's housing debt was going to be wiped from the books and that Tasmania was now going to be able to contribute the funds that had previously gone into paying down that debt and any interest on that debt into the provision of housing for those who need it most. It's something that has dogged Tasmanian governments for a very long time now, but finally it is done. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do acknowledge my Tasmanian colleague Senator Jacqui Lambie, who, of course, made a significant contribution, along with all Tasmanian representatives, to ensure that Tasmania had this debt waived. Given the unique challenge Tasmania faces, which is a result of strong economic growth under the guidance and management of the Hodgman government, in partnership with the coalition government here in Canberra, the growth in population numbers is putting a strain on infrastructure, essential services and also housing. This deal enables the government in Tasmania to allocate resources effectively to deal with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bridget Archer took us around the site in northern Tasmania, in the City of Launceston in the heart of the seat of Bass, showing us what can be done when governments invest in affordable housing, taking pressure off other parts of the housing market. I'm told that up to 80 houses a year can be constructed with the funds saved from paying down the debt early. So it's a wonderful initiative. The net result, of course, is the fact that more Tasmanians will have roofs over their heads. As I said, it was in partnership between the Hodgman government in Tasmania and the Morrison government here in Canberra, of course with the support of many from across the political spectrum. As I said, I especially acknowledge Jacqui Lambie but also Roger Jaensch, Will Hodgman and other members of the Tasmanian government for their strong advocacy for a very good outcome for our state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Closer to the portfolios I have the honour of working on, I turn to something that is very important to Tasmania, and that is the issue of aquaculture. Again, over the five weeks that we were not in Canberra, I had the pleasure of heading to the facility run by the University of Tasmania where $5 million from the Australian Research Council has been allocated to developing an onshore aquaculture system for rock lobsters, something that traditionally has been caught in the wild in the open waters around our coastlines. But now, thanks to leading research through the University of Tasmania, we are seeing a world first. We are breaking ground on a wonderful initiative to help support this fishery, making it more sustainable and more environmentally friendly, and providing certainty around the future of the stocks. In particular, it was the northern rock lobster, a tropical species found, as described, in the northern waters of this country. Down in Hobart, in the suburb of Taroona, at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies facility, the University of Tasmania is using these funds—$5 million, which is going to be spent over five years—to develop this process of being able to rear this specific species of rock lobster from its larval stage to a fully grown specimen that can then be released into the wild. This will help ensure that we do have certainty for fish stocks into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of this, the reality—and this is something that I note on many occasions when it comes to government funded research and development—is that great things are trialled, great things are discovered and we make leaps and bounds in research. This particular investment will result in a commercial outcome. This means we will be able to see jobs generated through this industry at the end of the expenditure of these funds. There are private entities interested in this particular project who will partner with the research developers to make sure that this thing does get off the ground and that in regional communities where these industries exist we will see jobs and economic growth. So that's where the rubber hits the road in terms of research and development funding. As I said, it's wonderful to be part of a government that does focus on ensuring that the expenditure of taxpayers' money on things like this has a tangible benefit for people paying taxes, particularly those outside of our major population centres. Although the research has been undertaken in southern Tasmania, in Hobart, it's the people in regional communities who will be benefitting from that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a world first for Tasmania in particular. It's a world first for our country. But I'm so proud as a Tasmanian senator to stand here and talk about research and development that's being undertaken in our little island state through our wonderful academic institutions like the University of Tasmania and the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies to make lives better for people by creating ways to give us some certainty around the future of industries that sometimes are subject to the vagaries of environmental changes and things that we don't fully understand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So in the last five weeks some great things have happened in Tasmania—particularly regional Tasmania. All of these things are supported by the Hodgman government in Tasmania and by the Morrison government in Canberra. It means jobs, economic growth and better lives for the people who live in our great state, and these things are the things that I'm very proud to be part of as part of this government, representing Tasmania here in Canberra.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="231199" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  I rise to speak today on a matter of grave concern to us all: family violence. It's one of the greatest community safety and law and order issues that we face in Australia, and it is the greatest community safety and law and order issue that we face in my home state of Tasmania. It's also one of the most preventable causes of death and disability, particularly for women, in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Family violence is still at unprecedented levels nationally, despite hundreds of millions being spent by governments, yet last week, when asked to acknowledge the role of guaranteed funding for a key family violence service in Tasmania, the Hodgman Liberal government declined. The Family Violence Counselling and Support Service is a key part of the Safe at Home service, which is Tasmania's integrated criminal justice response to family violence. It offers professional and specialised services to assist children, young people and adults affected by family violence. It provides information, counselling and support; information and support to family and friends; referrals to legal aid and/or court support; and group work programs for affected adults, children and young people. It acts as an advocate in accessing assistance with housing and Centrelink. It arranges assistance from police, assists in organising safe places to stay and liaises with the government and the non-government sector on behalf of clients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many years now it has done so much great work to safeguard people, mostly women and children, from the perpetrators of family violence, yet the Tasmanian government, led by a premier who has appointed himself Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence, will not commit to the future of the service or to adequately fund it. It beggars belief. Eradicating family violence in our community and ensuring victims and survivors receive the support they need should be above politics. It should be above ideology. It is simply not acceptable in this day and age for a government to deliberately deny support to a long-term frontline service working to protect those experiencing family violence in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The workers employed by this service are highly skilled specialists and they deserve our very best efforts, not the obfuscation of daily politics. They deserve secure jobs and a reasonable workload, not years of overwork and stress. I say to the Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence in Tasmania, the Premier: you can have as many reviews as you like; you can utter any number of concerned platitudes about improved service delivery and the refinement of models; and you can speak of stakeholder consultations, of 'clarifying the role of services' and of 'a wider service network', but the consistent underfunding and implicit undermining of this service through lack of consultation, and not even mentioning its name in the Tasmanian government's new Safe Homes, Families, Communities action plan, indicates that you are talking the talk without walking the walk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, as a community our understanding of family violence is changing. We know that it has a devastating impact on the health and wellbeing of victims. As attitudes change, more individuals are seeking help to escape violent and abusive relationships. This increase in demand is evident at the Family Violence Counselling and Support Service, with over 6,000 referrals last year. In the north of Tasmania, the demand for services has tripled since 2005. However, the service is only funded to deal with 2,000 referrals a year. They were operating on about one-third of the funding that they require.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To understand this issue fully, it is important to know that the Family Violence Counselling and Support Service is different from other service providers in Tasmania. They provide a service not provided by other non-government bodies or any other providers in this area. Its staff are among the most highly trained people in the country. They provide a specialist response, a response that has been showcased around the nation, and they are desperately swamped with the demands that they are now facing. Despite their expertise and commitment, the situation is taking its toll on these vital support workers. They provide the fastest and most timely response after incidents. Each day they get the police reports and are able to respond to those reports. This is not information other people have or are able to respond to. No non-government related service could do this, because of the way in which this service accesses police reports. They respond. They do cold calls. They advise, support and wrap services around people so they're able to take the necessary steps to keep them safe and to keep their families safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ali, a decade-long service user, wrote to me saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This service and the staff were all that held me together through multiple incidents of family violence and consistent failures of the justice and prison system. I could not have done it without the experienced and dedicated staff. These workers listened to the most intimate details of the abuse I experienced. They respected my personal experience and supported me to begin to heal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Violence Counselling and Support Service she is speaking of, that held her through all that trauma, had 10.3 full-time equivalent staff in 2012-13. Over the years, the staffing level has diminished, to 9.4 in 2017-18 having dipped as low as nine full-time equivalents in 2016. This may not appear to be a significant shift, but the nature of referrals during that time has changed dramatically. With 10.3 full-time equivalents over 2011, 2012 and 2013, their average case allocation was about 430, but by 2017-18 there were 6,126 referrals with four fewer staff. That means the average case allocation per full-time staff was 651. That is extraordinary and appalling. It equates to a 200 per cent increase in overall referrals to adult programs statewide. What's driven the increase? That would be changed community sentiment, increased education and awareness of services and victim-survivors feeling more comfortable about speaking out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another driver of this demand is Tasmania's housing crisis. There is a lack of affordable housing, and the government is rushing to fill a policy void and, to be frank, to cover its tracks on its extraordinary negligence in the provision of public and affordable housing for many Tasmanians attempting to flee family violence. There is often nowhere to go but a car, a tent or the street. Further, the total lack of recognition of this service in the government's new Safe Homes, Families, Communities action plan is simply offensive. Many people have reached the conclusion that there is a deliberate strategy to underfund the service to the point that it becomes so unviable they can kill it and wind it up, and then outsource it and put it out to tender—losing the extraordinary expertise of its staff and, along the way, losing still more secure jobs in Tasmania. This is all in the context of Premier Hodgman repeatedly saying eliminating family violence is a top priority for his government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the most conservative of assessments, Tasmania's Family Violence Counselling and Support Service has identified a shortfall of 11.54 full-time equivalent staff simply to cover the basics. If you wanted to provide an excellent service for Tasmanians, if you genuinely wanted to assist children, young people and adults affected by family violence, you would employ those extra staff and you would find the money. You would also seek out the advice of these staff in every consultation for every new plan and count yourself lucky to be part of a government that had people with such an incredible body of knowledge and skills in this area, which is one of the great policy and social challenges of our time. I call upon the Tasmanian government and the Morrison government to beware of the facade of clever words, to look to the specifics of what you are actually providing, to look to the specifics of what expertise you're nurturing, to look to the welfare of the staff providing those services and to safeguard services that are truly making a difference to the lives of thousands of vulnerable Australians. It's important to recognise that state and federal governments as well as many, many courageous survivors of family violence have shone a light on this, but that means little if we do not also adequately resource the dedicated professionals on the end of the phone.</span>

                  <a href="53369" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  In this place there has quite rightly been a focus on the stain that is this government's approach to the treatment of innocent people seeking asylum and the establishment of offshore prisons to act as a deterrent. What's not talked about as often but is just as brutal, is just as dehumanising, is the virtual prison we have created in this country for tens of thousands of innocent people seeking asylum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past few weeks we've seen the Australian community galvanise around one family, a Tamil family from the Central Queensland town of Biloela. The reason the community has finally rallied around this beautiful family is because we see them as people. This government has tried to deny innocent people their humanity. It calls them illegals, it calls them boat people, but what it doesn't do is acknowledge their humanity. The tens of thousands of people living in this country who have broken no law, who are here innocently, seeking our protection, are at breaking point. This government has introduced a practice that has taken away their most basic freedoms and liberties. We have created a virtual prison for these people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago I visited a mosque and a community centre in Melbourne's northern suburbs and I met dozens of people who were living on temporary protection visas. Their stories shocked me to the core. These are people living in limbo with no access to basic services and no idea about what their future might hold. It's difficult to imagine what this is like. These are people who fled the country of their birth because of circumstances outside their control and now find themselves in a country that treats them as though they are common criminals. The desperation of these people was heartbreaking, and today I want to share some of their stories in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me start with the story of Abdolreza and his daughter Zeinab. Abdolreza arrived in Australia by boat with his daughter in 2013 and sought asylum. They spent 5½ years on Nauru. His dream was to be reunited with his wife and his two other children, who left Iran only a short time before they did. They did it because they thought that leaving Iran separately was safer for both of them. They had been vocal about the Iranian government's occupation of their homeland, of Ahvaz, and this placed them in certain danger. Of course, the freedom to criticise a government is something we take for granted here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When they were on Nauru, Abdolreza and his daughter established relationships with a number of people. Some of the people they became friends with took their own lives. On 1 February this year they were sent to Australia on a community detention order. That means they don't have work or study rights. Abdolreza and Zeinab live in Melbourne's western suburbs, but his wife, son and other daughter live in the northern suburbs. Abdolreza and Zeinab have a curfew placed on them. They are only allowed to leave their house between the hours of 8 am to 6 pm, so they spend their days travelling to the north by public transport to see their family. Abdolreza can only meet his wife between the hours of 8 am and 6 pm; their family can only be reunited during that time. Not surprisingly, Abdolreza and Zeinab both suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder after being separated from their family for more than a decade. Just imagine travelling halfway around the world to be reunited with your family, only to be separated through community detention—so close yet miles away. That is what this government has condemned this family to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the story of Zahra and Hoda. With their family, Zahra and Hoda, first cousins, fled a dangerous situation in the Middle East, arrived in Australia in 2013 and were sent to Christmas Island. They were both 13 years old at the time. They spent a month on Christmas Island. They were transferred to a detention centre in Darwin. Twenty-eight days later, the family were granted a bridging visa with no right to work. They rented a house together. All nine members of the family lived together. Hoda and Zahra completed their English studies in six months. They then enrolled in year 9. They worked through school. They completed year 12. They were bright kids and they did exceptionally well. Hoda got an offer to study biomedical science, and Zahra got an offer to study nursing. But when you're living in limbo, when you are on a temporary protection visa, you can't access HECS and you certainly can't afford the upfront cost of a university degree. So we've got two bright girls who completed their education, studied hard and want to contribute to this nation but have been turned away. We're crying out for nurses and doctors and other health professionals, and yet this government's cruel migration policies won't allow those girls to fulfil their dream and contribute to Australia. They've been on the same bridging visa for seven years. They can't visit their family back home. Their grandmother died recently; they couldn't return to attend the funeral. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're born in this country and your parents are on a TPV, then you have no rights either. Let me tell the story of Roya and her family. Roya, an Iranian born refugee, sought asylum in Australia in June 2012. For the past seven years, she has been living in the community on a TPV. In 2017 she gave birth to a son, in the western suburbs of Melbourne—a healthy, happy boy at the time, but at the age of 15 months they noticed that something was wrong. They saw a paediatrician, and he was diagnosed with a form of cerebral palsy. Now, we know that that is a critical moment for a child. Physiotherapy and speech therapy at that moment in that child's life can make all the difference to their future life. So Roya, believing that a child born here in Australia would get access to services, applied for the NDIS. Her claim was rejected because Roya is on a TPV. Here we have a two-year-old child who has a chance of being able to walk and talk, and contribute to society, who is being denied basic health services by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the story of the <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    color:#000000;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Alsadani </span>family. The <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    color:#000000;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Alsadani </span>family came to Australia in 2012 to seek asylum. They spent eight months on Nauru, were transferred to a camp in Darwin and then, while they were having dinner, were rounded up and told to get on a bus because they were going to be moved to Christmas Island. On Christmas Island they were taken to an empty detention centre, housing just them and six other families, and then, over the following weeks, more people were brought to that camp. The <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    color:#000000;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Alsadani </span>family moved again, this time to Darwin. They had six months at the detention centre there, then they were sent to MITA, the detention centre in Melbourne. Karima fell pregnant with young Zainab. The family was then granted a community detention order, meaning they weren't allowed to work or study but had to wait until they were granted a bridging visa. The kids went to school. But of course the parents, under that visa, had no work rights—again suffering huge mental anguish. Hussein, another bright child, enrolled in high school, got good marks and got a scholarship to undertake a diploma in health studies at RMIT. The response? Centrelink cut their payments of $250 a fortnight because he was not eligible to undertake tertiary studies due to his immigration status. So he has quit studying and has been sitting idly ever since.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Refugee Advice and Casework Service warns that some TPV and SHEV holders are now at breaking point, and I've seen that with my own eyes. These are innocent people. These are decent people who want to make a contribution to this country, yet here we have laws that treat these people as less than human. It's about time that we, as a community, came together and recognised their humanity.</span>

                  <a href="HZE" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SESELJA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I rise today to talk about the great game of basketball. There has been a lot of coverage of basketball in Australia in recent times, with our Boomers doing very well but, unfortunately, falling just short of a medal at the recent world championships. Of course, some of our amazing NBA and WNBA talent and our NBL and WNBL talent set the world on fire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that context, we had a wonderful opportunity today to show our wares and to formally launch the Parliamentary Friends of Basketball, which I encourage all basketball fans to join. Tim Watts MP and I are the co-chairs. We held an event today to celebrate that and to celebrate 40 years of women's NBL. We had some great players. I'm going to tell a bit of a story. I need to set the scene a little bit because we did have some extraordinary talent on the court today. We had people like Lucille Bailey, who is a former Capitals captain, and Kelsey Griffin, who's the WNBL MVP. We also had our greatest ever, certainly greatest ever female, basketballer and one of our greatest ever sportspeople of any sport, the great Lauren Jackson, on the court today. I want to set up the talent mismatch there is when you have Lauren Jackson and Lucille Bailey and others and then a lot of us well-meaning politicians. We had Tim Watts; Senator Keneally was coaching, of course; Josh Burns, who does bring a bit of talent; Ed Husic, who brings a certain roughhouse, Balkan-style basketball, which I quite enjoy; me; and a number of others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to set up the talent mismatch. Lauren Jackson, if you read through her career achievements—and I won't be able to read through all of them—is an outstanding Australian, an extraordinary sportsperson and arguably the finest woman basketballer of all time from any country. She won numerous WNBL titles, first with the AIS and then with our local team the Canberra Capitals. She went to several Olympics where she won silver medals. She captained the Australian women's basketball team, the Opals, and took the Opals to world championship gold. She played in the WNBA. She's been in the all-star team in the WNBA. She's been the MVP of the WNBA. You get the picture: this is an extraordinary sportsperson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was reflecting on my own time in basketball, which, it's fair to say, hasn't been quite as illustrious. If I think back to when I started in the under-14s—I started a little bit late—I was put in the Wanniassa Eveready under-14s Gold team. I thought it was very good to be in the gold team. I was told later by Brendan McKenna that gold is not the best or the second best or perhaps even the third best—it's somewhere down the list. I rose through the ranks to the under-16s premier for Wanniassa Eveready and teams like JJ Bazan, which had an extraordinary record in the B2 division of men's here in the ACT. This sets up the mismatch that we had in terms of the great talent on the court.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do have to share a bit of a story, because I had an opportunity when receiving the ball, with Lauren Jackson hovering over me—she's six foot six and the greatest basketballer of all time. Some would call it a fluke. I don't know. The move is called a fadeaway jumper, which went in over Lauren Jackson. That was a great moment for me. I don't tell that story for my own purposes. I want to really go to the heart of what a great sport basketball is. You may be sceptical of it, and you wouldn't be alone because I actually did send some text messages to friends and family afterwards. I said, 'Look, fadeaway jumper over Lauren Jackson, the greatest female basketballer of all time.' There was a little bit of scepticism. My wife came back, 'Don't know what that means, but sounds very good,' which is nice. I got another one from my chief of staff, Angela: 'Hasn't she been injured? Laughs emoji.' So there was a little bit of scepticism. Michael, my son, asked, 'Do you mean in a dream?' No, not in a dream. In my defence, I have to go to some endorsements from the other side of politics. Ed Husic confirmed that, when the shot was taken, he saw his 'life flash before his eyes', he was so taken by the moment. Kristina Keneally, to her credit, who was coaching our great team of hacks in the game, did confirm that and did have some nice things to say on Twitter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this to make a couple of serious points. One is that basketball is a great sport; it is wonderful that those of us who were never really any good can get out there and have a go. Many of us, when were kids, dreamed of NBL or NBA glory, and I encourage young people out there to continue to dream. Most of us won't make it. Most of us won't make it to the heights reached by Lauren Jackson, Ben Simmons, Joe Ingles, Matthew Dellavedova, Lucille Bailey or so many great basketballers our country has produced, but basketball gives us the opportunity to occasionally just fluke a shot against a great player.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to finish by saying to colleagues and senators: absolutely get behind our Opals and our Boomers, they really have done us proud. The Boomers, I've got to say, were extraordinarily unlucky not to come away with a medal, and anyone who watched the semifinal game and then the bronze medal game couldn't help but be so proud of how they represented us. There was no shortage of courage, talent and effort on display, and it was heartbreaking to lose in double-overtime to Spain and then to lose to France, having led by a whole lot. But I think Australian basketball has great things happening. The women have showed the way with their success internationally with a gold medal at the worlds, with medals at the Olympics and with great WNBA success. But we are also seeing our men doing extraordinary things in the NBA. We are seeing some amazing talent. I hope—like all Australians, I'm sure—that we will be medalling in both the men's and women's basketball at next year's Olympics. I encourage people to get behind it and get behind the great sport of basketball.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  I rise to talk about this government's plans to impose a cashless debit card on 23,000 people in the Northern Territory. We have a long experience of compulsory income management in the Northern Territory. On 21 June 2007, the Howard government announced a national emergency response to supposedly protect First Nations children in the Northern Territory from sexual abuse and family violence. I was then the member for Arnhem in the Northern Territory government, a seat that represented mainly Indigenous communities. The emergency response—or the intervention, as we call it in the Territory—was a blunt instrument that slammed into Indigenous communities, demonising and disempowering First Nations people. There was certainly no discussion and no consultation, and overnight First Nations people in the Northern Territory lost control over their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compulsory income management, the lime-green BasicsCard, was a measure introduced to the Northern Territory under the intervention. It applied to 73 communities in prescribed areas of the Northern Territory, associated outstations and 10 town camp regions. The compulsory income management measure was meant to reduce discretionary disposable income by quarantining 50 per cent of all Australian government income support, family assistance payments and the then CDEP wages for an initial period of 12 months. According to the explanatory memorandum for the relevant bill at that time, the primary aims of income management were to:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">a)    to stem the flow of cash that is expended on substance abuse and gambling; and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">b)    to ensure funds that are provided for the welfare of children are actually expended in this way—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">and to protect vulnerable people from financial exploitation, including the practice known as, as we call it, humbugging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The original legislation introducing income management contained provisions that limited the application of the Racial Discrimination Act and other antidiscrimination legislation. The legislation and the intervention generally treated people differently on the ground of race. The overwhelming majority of people subject to income management in the Northern Territory are Indigenous. Twelve years later, even though the BasicsCard provisions were extended to urban, regional and remote areas of the Northern Territory, it is still the case that the majority of Territorians with a BasicsCard are Indigenous. Similarly, the government's proposals to impose a cashless debit card will overwhelmingly affect First Nations people in the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations Territorians are still dealing with the ramifications of the intervention, and it is really important that the Senate and the House of Representatives are very aware of the concerns that are emerging in the Northern Territory around the whole debate with the cashless debit card. It is quite difficult to describe the impact, because it happened well over a decade ago. As I said, I was a member of the Northern Territory parliament—I was the member for Arnhem—and as a parliamentarian I certainly felt powerless and voiceless at the time, as the Howard government rolled out these measures. If we in the Northern Territory parliament at the time felt disempowered, just imagine how the First Nations people and constituencies felt. In rolling out the intervention, the government had control over the smallest decisions that people could make. The Army, certainly, came into communities. People were scared—they were worried their children were going to be taken away again—and men, in particular, were demonised as paedophiles. It was scarring, it was debilitating, and the end result only seemed to be an increase in dysfunction and disconnection in remote communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators, when you take away people's ability to make decisions about their lives, to look after their families' interests, to govern their communities and to decide what to spend their money on, it has a deeply profound effect. Remember, compulsory income management doesn't exist in isolation. It's part of a system that now includes CDP, the Community Development Program, and that is designed to disempower First Nations people. Whether we like to hear it or not, that is the reality on the ground. And disempowerment leads to anger and, often, to hopelessness. To impose a new system of compulsory income management across the Territory on people who've already been subject to this experiment is going to reveal, as we travel across the Territory, the real depths of how people feel. It is important that our committee, the Community Affairs References Committee, is going to travel to listen to the concerns that people are going to raise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of people affected by this change, approximately 79 per cent, will be Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander income support recipients. So I'm sharing with the Senate that, after 12 years of having the system under the Northern Territory Emergency Response, or intervention, imposed in the Northern Territory, there is little evidence that compulsory income management results in widespread or long-term benefit. That evidence is not only academic; we will certainly hear it anecdotally, and it's something I see consistently in my work across the Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been hearing from many Territorians since the government flagged that it wants to introduce a cashless debit card. They're certainly very angry that they've not been consulted. As I've pointed out to them, our committee will be travelling to, certainly, the Northern Territory at this particular point in time to hear from them, and I do urge people across Australia to make sure they put in their submissions to our inquiry. But that anger is there, as is the realisation that they do want to be heard—and not only heard, but to have their concerns legitimately followed through on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory CEO, John Paterson, said, 'The cashless card proposal makes a mockery of government rhetoric around Aboriginal controlled decision-making.' Mr Paterson said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This feels like the Howard era Intervention all over again …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This directly opposes recent commitments by the Federal Government and COAG to work with us in partnership on Closing the Gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I reiterate that, whilst I certainly know those concerns are out there, it is important that our committee hears quite clearly from everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Arnhem Land Progress Aboriginal Corporation, a strong Aboriginal controlled organisation with successful enterprises under its umbrella, are very concerned by the negative effect it will have on Yolngu communities. Keith Lapulung of Milingimbi, who's the director of the Arnhem Land Progress Aboriginal Corporation, or ALPA, said of the card:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It will add to the negative effects of the Intervention in our communities, not only taking away peoples control over their lives but by making it harder for small Indigenous businesses who may not be able to accept the card to survive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this historical context is going to be quite critical to our committee as we travel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">ALPA have direct experience with a system that actually works. The ALPA FOODcard is a voluntary family budgeting tool. Customers can choose to have money paid into the FOODcard card at any time and then spend that money over the remainder of the pay cycle on a selected range of food and household essentials. Why do I mention this? Because the FOODcard assists by voluntarily protecting money that people want to put aside for food, away from the pressures from other, non-essential expenditure. It is a system that is working, it is voluntary, and, most importantly, it was developed on community, by community, as a solution to some of the issues they identified.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly ask the government to take a new approach. Listen to First Nations people and communities in the Territory who have innovative ideas and solutions to these issues. If a community genuinely wants to use this cashless debit card, they should be properly consulted with and provided with the necessary supports. Labor are not opposed to income management in all circumstances, but we're opposed to the broad based compulsory programs that ensnare and disempower all people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  Trust—as a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to speak today about one word—'trust'—and a friend who earned, through hardship, many people's enormous trust. Integrity—we have all heard plenty about this issue in the Senate of late, mainly in the context of it being missing from the actions of recent former ministers. I am, of course, referring to the outrageous behaviour of Mr Christopher Pyne and Ms Julie Bishop in leaving their ministerial roles to walk straight into cushy jobs, and raising public questioning and disgust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a part of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee's inquiry into their cushy jobs. They answered my questions about their intentions and salaries with weasel words. They didn't build trust. I asked the then top bureaucrat in Australia, Martin Parkinson, at the time the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, questions about his 'investigation' into their post-ministerial employment. He was evasive, and finally, after he had repeatedly told the committee of senators of his 'investigation', he admitted to me that he had no investigatory powers. No investigation, despite the Prime Minister asking him to investigate with no investigatory powers. How can anyone trust such a system, such a structure?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a complete insult to the intelligence of the Australian people, who deserve a full answer as to how their taxes are spent to help line the pockets of these politicians. They springboard into lucrative positions based on their acquired knowledge and experience as federal politicians. And without full explanation and proper investigation, many people could easily perceive the cushy job as a reward for services rendered. That undermines parliament's reputation. It undermines the people's trust in their elected representatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another extreme example of this abhorrent behaviour is that of Mr Andrew Robb, the ex trade minister, who, after negotiating the controversial 99-year lease of Darwin Port to the Chinese owned Landbridge group, promptly accepted a consultancy position with Landbridge for a salary in excess of $880,000 per year—not much integrity here, and yet another insult to Australian taxpayers, another breach of trust. This greedy and questionable behaviour has extended into corrupt, fraudulent behaviour and into other areas of government, including within the Queensland state government, as identified as far back as the Fitzgerald inquiry, after which several government ministers were charged and convicted of dishonesty offences. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent times, corruption in local government has been particularly in the public eye, with Ipswich having been considered the corruption capital of Queensland. Corruption in Queensland has been reported since the Fitzgerald inquiry in 1989 and the Shepherdson inquiry in 2002. Recently, two—not one—past mayors of Ipswich have been convicted of council-conduct-related offences. Former ALP mayor Paul Pisasale was convicted of extortion and related offences and jailed. Former mayor Andrew Antoniolli was convicted of multiple fraud charges. The people of Ipswich deserve far better. The people want to be able to trust the representatives that they elect. The corruption of the Ipswich City Council was so widespread that local ALP member of parliament, Mrs Jo-Ann Miller, was threatened with expulsion from the ALP when she spoke up about the corrupt Ipswich City Council. She shone a light on it, and good luck to her. She should be commended for her stance in opposing the corruption from members of her own party. She first raised the issue as a newly elected state MP in 2004 and was endlessly hounded and punished in various ways for her honest efforts working for justice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, however, finally some light at the end of this dark tunnel of misconduct and corruption. In Ipswich, an honest, courageous and highly competent man, Mr Gary Duffy, and his equally courageous, honest and competent partner, Conny Turni, exposed corruption in the Labor Ipswich City Council. This led to 16 people being charged, including two former mayors, two chief executive officers, a chief operations officer and an associated lawyer, all of them with over 100 criminal offences identified. The end result was the state government's sacking of the entire Ipswich City Council. Fourteen years after Jo-Ann Miller first raised it, the state appears to have covered up or at least turned a blind eye to Ipswich's rampant law-breaking. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ipswich City Council has been supported by the Local Government Association of Queensland, who, contrary to the interests of taxpayers, had advised the council members how to ensure that ratepayers paid for all the legal costs of the charged councillors. The sacked council members were all advised by the Local Government Association of Queensland how to ensure that ratepayers would pay all the council members' legal costs. A common link to this local government corruption has been the involvement of the Local Government Association of Queensland. And that raises an important question: does the Local Government Association of Queensland's involvement point to corruption and law-breaking at Ipswich being just a symptom of wider corruption across other councils in Queensland? Is there a template or a system for this corruption? Well, this level of corruption is not isolated. In Logan City Council, the exposure of corruption within the council led to seven councillors and the mayor being charged with corruption and conspiracy offences and the ultimate sacking of the entire council. Gary, with Conny's support, was up against the combined might of the Ipswich Labor machine, the Queensland state Labor machine, the Local Government Association of Queensland machine—all with their bulging coffers and revenue streams—and he beat them. Yet Gary's actions came at great personal, health and financial cost. Fortunately, he's recovering. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Gary Duffy is the local Ipswich man who was brave enough to expose the corrupt culture at the Ipswich City Council. He pushed for full investigations of the claims that were pointing the finger of corruption at the very highest levels of the Ipswich City Council. His concerns and brave actions were, in fact, justified when the court dealt with the offenders. He and his wife Conny have a long history of successful voluntary work supporting Ipswich in sporting, community and business activities. He has coached Rugby League and Union for over 16 years and is widely respected across the community. He offers persistence, integrity and great courage in taking on the Goliaths of evil. He is a generous man and he's both liked and trusted. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gary Duffy has much more to offer the Ipswich community, and I am pleased to encourage and support him to stand as a candidate for mayor of the Ipswich City Council at the forthcoming election in March. When I stood for the state seat of Ipswich in the 2017 Queensland state election, I met Gary for the first time and saw repeatedly the regard, the respect and the trust in which the people of Ipswich hold him. I worked with him and saw people thank him in the street personally for his work for their city. I learnt of threats he had endured and overcome with his courage. Beyond these core traits, I was impressed with Gary's hard work and endless energy. He is a very, very hard worker—researching into the early morning, getting up early in the morning and going back to work after just two or three hours of sleep. He has devoted hours, years, of his life as a volunteer. His background is diverse. After working in many industries—banana grower, mechanic—he's practical and a clear thinker. He has lived overseas. He researches extensively and make decisions based on facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After being slapped with questionable lawsuits accusing him of defamation, apparently to shut him up and bog him down in legal formalities, Gary persisted, worked his way through the legal morass and emerged intact. How? Because he believes in being accurate. Accuracy is important to both Gary and Conny and that drives their extensive research. Gary stands for supporting local jobs for locals and wishes to return to the concept of the council employing its workers directly and locally, not through subcontracting to overseas interests. He supports the council taking on more apprentices, undertaking to grow the skill levels of those working in the city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly of all, Gary Duffy has the heart and the stamina to lead the new Ipswich City Council as its mayor to become a beacon in local government across Queensland. The people of Ipswich deserve an honest, capable candidate. Mr Gary Duffy has the energy, resilience, integrity and honesty to do what is right for the people of Ipswich. Despite the intimidation and threats, Gary, with Conny's support, has prevailed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ipswich was once Queensland's second most prominent city—glory days. Gary, as mayor, would make a wonderful start to restoring Ipswich's reputation. Having as head of the council someone who has a record of selflessly and honestly serving the fine people of Ipswich, Gary Duffy has something that today is rare in politics—trust. Gary has earned the people's trust.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283601" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Our oceans are choking with plastic and other waste, yet conversations within our community are repetitive, and action needs to move at a quicker pace. Single-use plastics are everywhere. Plastic bags carry our groceries and single-use plastic bottles stack our shelves in our supermarkets despite there being clear alternatives like aluminium and glass. From the comfort of our home, images flash on our television screens of marine wildlife washing up having been tangled in or having ingested a single-use plastic item. One of the worst reflections of our global plastics problem has evolved into what has been dubbed the 'great Pacific garbage patch'. This patch covers an area almost the size of Queensland and is filled with waste from all continents. Over half the plastic in the patch comes from land based sources, with much of the worst plastic coming from single-use items such as plastic bags, bottle tops, soft drink bottles and Styrofoam cups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With statistics and examples becoming better known, it is without a doubt that Australia can play a leadership role in phasing out single-use plastics. Solutions to this problem are available. According to the Australian Aluminium Council, aluminium is 100 per cent recyclable and uses only five per cent of the energy used to create new aluminium. So why not trade in those plastic bottles for aluminium or glass? We need to question our habits and work towards responsible pragmatic actions which will do more to assist in protecting our ocean and marine life. This is not to say that there hasn't been a burgeoning cultural shift over the past few years in the way that Australians view and use single-use plastics. Many of us bring reusable bags to carry our groceries these days or, grudgingly, when we forget, purchase another biodegradable bag at inflated prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not often that I find myself looking abroad to countries like Antigua, Rwanda or Vanuatu for inspiration, yet their tough approach to tackling single-use plastic is definitely noteworthy. All of these countries have taken the step of banning at least some forms of single-use plastic and imposing strict penalties on producers, importers and retailers who fail to oblige. These countries have seen a dramatic reduction in the amount of plastic waste polluting their urban and marine environments. Vanuatu is a leader in our region when it comes to banning single-use plastic. Last July our Pacific neighbour banned single-use plastic bags, drinking straws and styrofoam food containers, with fines for violations. Whilst it might sound like an inconvenience to our lives of convenience, it is, I believe, a measure that Australians would accept and grow to work around if such a ban was phased in across our nation in a very well-managed way. There will be those who worry about the effect that such an action will have on business. To them, I would argue that there is perhaps no greater driver of innovation than correctly applied pressure and clearly set out deadlines. If the people of Vanuatu can adjust, you have to ask yourself: why can't Australians?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before such legislation is even to be considered by the Australian parliament, private industry has been playing a role in the reduction of single-use plastic products. Innovative companies from my home state of Victoria, like KeepCup and RETURNR, have effectively developed ways to replace single-use plastic with a reusable solution in the takeaway food industry. They recognise that global sustainability plays an important role in their business, and they walk the talk by having a go as entrepreneurs. This leads to pragmatic, sensible outcomes and not just virtue signalling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a pragmatist, I acknowledge that it may not be possible to ban all products that are currently manufactured using single-use plastic. For instance, there are health and safety products where it makes eminent sense to use single-use plastic. Where we are still waiting for technology to catch up, we need to do more to ensure responsible disposal of such products so that we can be certain that they will not end up in our waterways. In 2011 our federal parliament passed the Product Stewardship Act, which provides a structure for whole-of-life management of consumer products and the components contained within them. That bill was an example of true bipartisanship in environmental affairs. It set up a framework which established voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship, which can be characterised as placing responsibility for the effective disposal of products on the producer or importer. Since the enactment of that legislation, no mandatory stewardship programs have been enforced under the scheme. I believe that we should start facilitating dialogue with industry and government to incorporate such mandatory schemes under this existing legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few months, the Morrison government has made it clear that tackling Australia's waste-management crisis is a priority, and I applaud the Prime Minister for his bold commitment of over $160 million in recycling investment and research funds and for putting pressure on the states to clean up their act when dealing with recyclable waste. The Minister for the Environment has set a realistic target: to have 100 per cent of Australia's packaging be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Such a target is absolutely a step in the right direction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With these measures, environment policy can no longer be hijacked by those on the left of centre claiming to be the sole custodians of our environment. The role of states and territories in this fight also does not go unnoticed. I highlight the recent announcement by Premier Steven Marshall in South Australia, who is leading the country by committing to banning plastic straws, cutlery and drink stirrers. In my home state of Victoria, shamefully, the Andrews government is yet to implement a container deposit scheme. It is the only state yet to propose one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, my belief is that the real solution to reducing pollutants more broadly will come when market efficiencies and consumers encourage the producer to innovate and come up with ways to prevent the production of pollutants in the first place. While the push to phase out single-use plastics is a global one, Australia can play a role by confidently setting standards and expectations on limiting one of our major pollutants. If products can reasonably be replaced by current alternatives, we should promote and incentivise the phasing out of single-use plastics. Where this is not immediately possible, mandatory stewardship partnerships should actively drive innovative solutions for the effective disposal of waste whereby producers are working hand-in-hand with business to recycle the leftovers of pollutants after the consumer has used them. It is only in partnership and with a sense of urgency that we can ensure single-use plastics are phased out so that we can ensure a cleaner future for our nation, our children and those to follow.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, an important opportunity for all of us in this place and in the other place to learn the facts about the most dangerous disease for children. Childhood cancer kills more kids in Australia than any other disease. Children don't get the same types of cancer as adults. There is no known cause and no prevention for these cancers, so scientific research in this space truly does matter. September is a time to honour the children and the many families affected by this disease. By working together in this place we can raise awareness along with the vital funds to find better treatment and hopefully a cure. I know both sides of this place have worked on this in a bipartisan manner for many years. In the last election it was very good to see both the minister and the shadow minister working in the preventive health space—a first for a very long time, I think—and hopefully that will continue for many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Kids' Cancer Project is committed to directing funding towards the best and brightest childhood cancer researchers in Australia. The project highlights the lack of awareness of childhood cancer. It has stated that nearly three-quarters of the Australian population have no idea that more kids die from cancer than any other disease. The numbers are stark: 1,000 children and adolescents will be diagnosed with cancer this year alone and 5,600 will undergo treatment. The treatments children undergo are painful, and the experience of families as they watch and hope and fight is stressful. Watching an extended family of mine care for their daughter over in the United Kingdom, as she has been treated for leukaemia over a number of years now, has brought home the reality of this experience: the constant worry, the pressure, the small wins, the setbacks and the need to take things just a day at a time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I was fortunate enough to attend the Children's Cancer Foundation charity lunch in Melbourne, where I was moved by the stories of many who were there that day—in particular, the story of Melbourne mother Kate Johnson, who shared about her son's experience of being diagnosed with and undergoing treatment for cancer. At the age of three, Kate's son David was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. He started treatment immediately. For 3½ years, David went through dozens of general anaesthetics; two neurosurgeries; many lumbar punctures, MRIs and CT scans; and, on top of all that, almost a thousand doses of chemotherapy. There were complications, emergency surgery, a stroke and an induced coma. Thankfully, David did come through his experience of childhood cancer. He is 10 years old now, but at the time it was a frightening experience for Kate, her husband, young David and their family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the lunch, she told the attendees: 'Each minute was critical, and we had no idea whether he'd survive. There are literally no words to describe how terrifying this time was.' Later, highlighting the importance of better awareness and funding for research, Kate said: 'It is so important, when going through a cancer diagnosis, to know that your child is receiving world-class treatments. We know firsthand the importance of finding more targeted treatments with fewer side effects and how desperately underfunded this is.' Kate is correct. The shocking statistic I mentioned earlier will only improve with science—more research for better treatments, less painful treatments and more effective treatments. This research is necessary, but it is also expensive, and the first step towards funding is better community awareness. That's why in this month of September, I and many others are wearing gold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Global Childhood Cancer Awareness Month was declared in 2010 by former US President Barack Obama. The colour gold was chosen for the cause as it represents a precious metal, to represent the precious lives affected by childhood cancer. All around the world, important buildings and landmarks have been lit up in the colour gold to help raise awareness of childhood cancer. Supporters are sharing their stories and advocacy on social media, adding gold ribbons to their profile pictures and turning their newsfeeds gold. And, importantly, supporters and friends are holding events and donating to help raise funds for research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I call on my colleagues here and in the other place, as well as members of the community and those who are listening to the broadcast, to help by donating a few dollars to help researchers develop better treatments and hopefully one day find a cure for childhood cancer. And I strongly encourage members in this place and those who are listening to go visit the website at www.kidscancerproject.org.au.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, in 2010, US President Obama proclaimed Childhood Cancer Awareness Month in order to raise awareness that kids with cancer need help from the community. Gold is the official colour for what is now a global event. Wearing the gold ribbon is symbolic of solidarity and unity with children and families affected by the disease. Many different childhood cancer charities collaborate and join forces to focus attention on the plights of the 950 children diagnosed every year in Australia. All Australians are invited to support the cause, either by wearing a gold ribbon or making a donation to a charity committed to making the lives of kids with cancer better.</span>

Obviously, the senator would be well aware this is once in a lifetime—it is a massive reform—and us moving away from the block funding model that operated in the past to this demand driven model has been something that's changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians who live with disability and their families who care for them.</span>

The rollout has accelerated significantly. In my answer to the last question I pointed out to the chamber that, in the last financial year, 115,000 people have actually gone onto this package. We would say that it was slightly slower than we would have hoped for the start-up to the rollout; however, 115,000 people—</span>

Yesterday in question time you made it very clear that you wished for senators to desist from using points of order to simply repeat the question. Senator Brown asked a wide-ranging question that related to the rollout of the NDIS scheme. It is very clear that Senator Ruston is being directly relevant to the question. Just because Senator Ruston has not, in the first 31 seconds of her response, come to one point of Senator Brown's question, it should not be used as a point for Senator Brown to abuse question time by repeating her question yet again.</span>

                  </a>  I'd simply respond to the proposition that's been put by the deputy leader. If there is an abuse of question time it is in the minister's failure to respond to the question, and that is why you are seeing the opposition respond in the way we are.</span>

I would at least ask senators to be a little more imaginative in their use of language to make a point of order on direct relevance that does not involve simply rereading out part of the question.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second question you asked in your question, Senator Brown, in my view, included phrases that reflect upon the government's administration of the scheme. The minister is being directly relevant to challenge those and outline alternative facts. I believe that in this case that is what the minister is doing and she is being directly relevant to the second part of your question.</span>

But the substance of her question is about the rollout of the NDIS, and I can absolutely assure this place that the Morrison government, our government, is absolutely committed to the full rollout of this demand-driven, state-of-the-art, massive reform in the disability sector.</span>

As many in this chamber may be aware Friday 20 September marks 20 years since the deployment of the International Force East Timor, commonly known as INTERFET. On this day the Australian led INTERFET arrived in Timor-Leste under the command of Major General Peter Cosgrove. Its mission was to restore peace and security following the violence that erupted in the wake of the 30 August Popular Consultation on the question of Timor-Leste's independence. Through INTERFET, Australia and International partners from over 22 nations worked alongside the people of Timor-Leste to overcome violence with peace. Twenty years later this Friday, Timor-Leste is a proud nation with a vibrant democracy, strong institutions and a resilient population striving for growth and prosperity. This is why I'm so honoured to be travelling to Dili along with now retired general the Hon. Sir Peter Cosgrove and the Minister for Veterans and Defence Personnel, the Hon. Darren Chester, to represent Australia and mark this important milestone in Timor-Leste's history.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commemorations will also be significant for thousands of Australians who served in Timor-Leste. I'll be joined by a contingent of around 60 serving Army, Navy and Air Force veterans who served with the INTERFET mission, as well as the crew of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Choules</span>, which will be in Dili over the commemoration period. I very much look forward to standing with the Timor-Leste government and the people of Timor-Leste to remember INTERFET and all of those who served so honourably in the pursuit of peace.</span>

Since the days of INTERFET, Australia has worked tirelessly with Timor-Leste to develop its defence and its own sovereign security capability. Today, Australia is Timor-Leste's largest development and security partner. Our $7 million Defence Cooperation Program has almost doubled over the last five years and is now the second largest in the region behind our contributions to PNG. Our $7 million Defence Cooperation Program focuses on two-way cooperation in the areas of maritime security; engineers and infrastructure development; logistics; and also peacekeeping. I very much look forward to learning about Timor-Leste's priorities for future security cooperation when I meet my counterpart, Minister Meno, tomorrow.</span>

I refer to an article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> today in which the Minister for Education, Mr Tehan, cautioned medical students against participating in Friday's global climate strike after the head of the University of Melbourne's medical school encouraged students to participate in the strike in recognition of the significant health impacts of climate change. In response, the minister said that medical students should not be striking—they should be striking on the weekend and not about climate change. Does the minister agree with his colleague that school strikes should only take place on the weekend?</span>

That is something that our government strongly and passionately defends. However, where taxpayers are funding education and services for students to receive, our view is that if you want to go out and protest, if you want to go out and exercise your right to free speech, go your hardest but do it at a time of day and in a place where taxpayers are not footing the bill for your education. Do it at a time and in a place when you are in your own time, not when the taxpayer is paying or contributing towards what it is you're doing to receive an education. That was put very plainly by Mr Tehan, and I thank you very much, Senator, for quoting him. Mr Tehan wasn't saying that people aren't entitled to protest or aren't entitled to have their say, but he was very clear in his messaging to indicate that, if they're going to do so, they should do it in their own time, not on the taxpayer's dime.</span>

However, given the point of a strike is to cause disruption in order to effect social change, can the government now understand why a strike outside of school hours, outside of business time, would defeat the purpose of a strike? In other words, mate, do you understand what a strike even is? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Our position is quite clear: the actions of students in doing so do mean that the potential is that additional costs are incurred in having to reschedule lectures, particularly in the case of medical students, where there are expectations that the courses they're undertaking are, of course, fully received and that students need to act there. The disruption is also to fellow students in that regard as well. Ultimately, this is a choice for individual students, but we've made very clear there's nothing wrong with having a say but do it in your own time.</span>

I doubt very much that Mr Tehan is encouraging students to strike, but he is certainly highlighting to them the fact that there are many issues upon which medical students may wish to reflect. And one of them that he would encourage current medical students to reflect upon is that more of them ought to be thinking about going and working and servicing rural regions. That's why amongst our government's reforms to medical education has been the creation of rural training hubs that provide more opportunities for more rural students to study medicine in rural Australia in the hope and expectation that they will stay in rural Australia and deliver those critical healthcare services to the rural and regional Australians who need them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:24</span>):  Thank you, Senator McDonald, for your question and for your strong advocacy for sugar growers in Queensland. The sugar industry is a major contributor to the economies of rural and regional communities in Queensland and northern New South Wales, generating more than $2 billion for the national economy and making it the third-largest sugar exporter in the world. In 2017, our government introduced the Sugar Code of Conduct to provide for pre-contract arbitration when growers, millers and marketers fail to agree to terms, contracts or agreements with each other and to guarantee grower choice for the marketing of sugar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The review of the code last year sought feedback and evidence as to whether the code was operating as intended. Following significant consultation, the government committed to retaining the code, which continues to provide certainty for growers, millers, marketers and the many thousands of Australians employed in the sugar export supply chain. With the code in place, growers, millers and marketers are now able to get on with the job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our sugar farmers are suffering from the low value of sugar on the world market, further exacerbated by India's announcement of a six million tonne export subsidy of $216 a tonne starting next year. The Australian government is deeply concerned with India's excessive sugar subsidies. To help the sugar industry, the government have exercised our right to protect the 40,000 sugar industry jobs by initiating a dispute settlement action in the WTO against India's sugar subsidy regime. This panel was established on 15 August.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">India's subsidies are vastly in excess of its limits under the WTO rules, contributing to a glut on the global sugar market and driving prices down to unsustainable lows, hurting Australia's globally competitive sugar industry. Our government continues to stand with sugarcane growers and the millers throughout Queensland and New South Wales.</span>

Queensland Labor's Environmental Protection (Great Barrier Reef Protection Measures) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, commonly known as the reef bill, legislates for the government to give itself the power to request documents from all farm suppliers, employees, contractors and customers.

We will continue to respond to elements of the Tune review while the royal commission continues, including things like we've already done, such as the new Aged Care Quality Standards, which began on 1 July this year; the commencement of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, which started on 1 January this year; the implementation of a residents charter, which also started on 1 July this year; and the commencement of new regulations around the use of physical and chemical restraints. </span>

We continue to work and monitor the work of the royal commission and take note of the comments that are being made out of that process, because, as we said, we would not stop the process of reform that we wanted to continue while the royal commission was being undertaken, and so we continue to do that. We haven't completed that process yet, but we continue to work towards that goal.</span>

The government will obviously consider the issues that come out in the interim report, but the report that we will be responding to formally is the final report, which is due on 12 November next year. But I reject the premise that we have not continued to reform the aged-care system while the royal commission has been in place because, clearly, we have done and continue to do a number of things. Since the royal commission was called, as I said, we have put in the new consumer focused Aged Care Quality Standards, we have the new single Charter of Aged Care Rights, we have established the new independent Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission and we have put new provider requirements in place to minimise physical and chemical restraints. There are a number of things that we've done and continue to do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Senator Paterson, like every coalition senator, is somebody who strongly backs the ability of Australian farmers and Australian businesses to succeed when they engage in overseas markets, to succeed on the export scene, and that is exactly what we have seen occur over recent years as a result of our government's success in creating new opportunities for Australian businesses. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see the delivery of certainty of opportunity for Australian businesses through enhanced market access, to enable them to sell more goods, sell more services and secure more investment from different international markets—and that has been delivered across each of our trade negotiations. We stand ready to do so with the United Kingdom, when they exit the European Union, as part of their domestic policy settings. We stand ready to do that because the UK is already a major trading partner for Australia. It is our eighth-largest trading partner in terms of total goods and services trade, a trading partner with which we have existing trade to the value of some $26.9 billion and a trading partner where our foreign investment is valued at some $574.8 billion of support for Australian jobs, Australian growth and Australian companies. It is critical for us to make sure that we continue to provide support for growth in that relationship, as we do in all of our international export and investment relationships.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have prepared for all of the potential uncertainties surrounding Brexit, including the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, to make sure that Australian businesses can have as much certainty as possible of access into the UK market and the EU market into the future. We are, as is well known, already at the stage of negotiating a free trade agreement with the European Union, a very valued partner. We stand ready to commence negotiations formally with the United Kingdom upon them leaving the European Union and to maximise the opportunities of that market as well.</span>

We have already had a trade working group established with the UK to work through the uncertainties of Brexit and to look at the potential scoping of a future free trade agreement and future negotiations, and today we very strongly reaffirmed our commitments to one another, between our respective countries, to launch those FTA negotiations as soon as possible following the UK's exit from the European Union Customs Union. Australia has a great track record of being able to quickly and effectively negotiate trade agreements under a coalition government. It is the success of our government in sealing agreements such as the TPP, as well as those with major North Asia economies and elsewhere, that is delivering record export volumes, and we want to ensure this continues through such negotiations with the UK.</span>

In fact, 18½ per cent more businesses are exporting today than when we were elected as a government. The number has grown to 53,000 Australian businesses. Critically, 46,000 of those businesses are small and medium enterprises who are having a go on the international stage and enjoying success exporting because of the market access we have negotiated. In doing so, they are helping to support record numbers of jobs. An estimated 240,000 additional trade-related jobs have been created during our time in government. This is providing more opportunities for businesses, more opportunities for employment and, of course, greater revenue for Australia. We are seeing that revenue come from across the sphere of our trade agreements. Trade with ASEAN countries is up 25 per cent on the previous financial year; with Korea, up 21 per cent; Japan, up 21 per cent; and China, up 27 per cent; and there are plans for expansion into markets like the UK and the EU.</span>

Reserve Bank interest rate cuts and recent tax cuts have not yet proved successful in stimulating our slowing economy. The key to consumer consumption and business investment is confidence in the future. Minister, can you detail what firm plans the government has to restore economic confidence for all Australians?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to the recent statements by the Governor of the Reserve Bank. He made the point that he expected, looking forward, growth in Australia to strengthen, to be around trend over the next couple of years. That outlook is being supported by a low level of interest rates, recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on infrastructure, signs of stabilisation in some established housing markets and a pick-up in the resources sector. Our government continues to implement our plan for a stronger economy, with $300 billion of income tax relief, providing incentive to hardworking Australians, encouraging them to get ahead; lower taxes for business; an ambitious infrastructure investment program, with a pipeline of $100 billion worth of investment; and an ambitious free trade agenda. We are working to cover 90 per cent of our exports in products and services with free trade agreements—it was 26 per cent when we came into government—to give better access to key markets around the world. And we have an ambitious plan to bring down electricity prices for business and households.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people were presented with two alternative plans for the economy moving forward. They opted for our plan of lower taxes, stronger growth, more jobs and higher wages over time. If you look at the last 12 months: 2.6 per cent growth in employment compared to 1½ per cent employment growth when the budget was delivered for the 2018-19 financial year. It is very clear that our plan is starting to work. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Labor had stopped listing medicines on the PBS because they'd made such a mess of the budget. We're focused on more affordable energy, with energy costs down by up to 15 per cent for over half a million families and small businesses under our policies. More affordable housing: we have successfully implemented the majority of measures announced in the reducing pressure on housing affordability 2017-18 budget package.

She is right to quote the Prime Minister on the fact that aged care is one of the priorities of the government, because it clearly is one of the priorities of the government, and I've heard the Prime Minister make that comment in quite a few forums. In fact, he addressed our party room on Tuesday to say exactly the same thing. It is one of the key priorities, and we went to the election with that priority. That's why yesterday I was so delighted to announce that the number of home care packages in the market to the end of June last year had grown by 25,000. That's a significant achievement by this government that we had an extra 25,000 home care packages in the market. That's why at the last—</span>

It's interesting to note that, despite the concern expressed by those opposite, at the last election they did not put one single dollar into additional home care packages—not one single dollar—</span>

                  </a>  Mr President, consistent with your exhortation yesterday to give ministers more time, we have done so. The question is not about policies the opposition might or might not have taken to the election. The question is about the number of new service providers approved by the department in the last 24 months. I would ask that you remind the minister of the question and of the standing orders for him to be directly relevant.</span>

However, the preamble to the question referred to a statement by the Prime Minister that claimed a government commitment to a particular policy. The minister is entitled to address that part of the question. I believe what he's saying right now is directly relevant to the part of the question, albeit observations on opposition policies are not.</span>

To ensure that people are receiving those services in their home in a safe way, in a way that obviously clearly meets their needs, is extremely important. The government is cognisant of, is very aware of and is alert to the issues that have been raised by the royal commission. In the context of the development of a set of compliance frameworks that work not just in home care but also across the NDIS, I think it is a very important direction that we are heading <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It should be the No. 1 priority to protect people in the industry. The most important things people can leave a mine site with is their life and their health. I would like to recognise that tomorrow is the Miners Memorial Day in Queensland, which does mark the state's worst mine disaster at Mount Mulligan in Far North Queensland in 1921, where 75 miners died. There is a memorial service in Moura tomorrow to mark that anniversary. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my area of responsibility for the offshore oil and gas sector, it is good that we have had six consecutive years now without a fatality. We can never rest on our laurels, though. In the first half of last year, we had a surge in near misses that could have caused a death or serious injury. So at last year's APPEA conference I convened a roundtable with leaders in the oil and gas sector to remind them of their obligations to protect health and safety and I also mentioned the issue in my speech to the conference. It has been a welcome result that, in the second half of the year, we had a major drop in those incidents and, in fact, by the end of 2018 we had recorded the lowest number of near misses that could have caused a death or serious injury since 2010.</span>

The Australian government fully supports the safety reset that is occurring in the Queensland coal industry and encourages all businesses to make sure they meet their obligations under that policy.</span>

Since the federal election, in particular, a number of environmental activist groups have been throwing a long hissy fit about the results of the election and are out there supergluing themselves to streets in capital cities and, sometimes, putting themselves in extremely dangerous positions at mine sites or ports. This puts at risk not only their own safety but also the safety of the workers there. </span>

Join today and encourage your colleagues to do the same.' That email communication links to the Australian Council of Trade Unions recruitment website, and the ACTU have been out there encouraging people to take action and to be out there in this strike on Friday. They are also encouraging people to take this kind of unsafe action. How can a trade union, which is meant to be there to protect worker safety in this country, align itself with people who are directly encouraging people to put worker safety at risk? It is irresponsible and reprehensible and should be condemned by all in this place who stand up for worker safety and protect the right of Australians to go to their job and go back home safely.</span>

I have to say it's disappointing that you took it from your question time team, because I thought that you of all people had more integrity than that. This is nothing more and nothing less than an attack on a member of parliament who has been validly elected by the people of Chisholm. In relation to the article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span>, I say this to the Senator: under our immigration system all visa applicants' individual assessments are assessed against all legal requirements. That happens to be a fact. That is what happens. So, Senator, in answer to your question, this is all about more personal attacks on a member of parliament who has been validly elected by the people in her electorate. </span>

We had the Leader of the Government in the Senate nursing his ministers through question time, providing them with suggested responses to questions from Labor senators. We asked some very straightforward questions to both Senator Ruston and Senator Colbeck. In terms of the questions to Senator Ruston, it was to try to elicit information about the waiting list, the demand for services that people in the community are experiencing or the wait for those services through the enrolment or lack of enrolment through the NDIS system. The reason we're asking these questions is that, for any person who's elected in this parliament, right across the country, if they have a range of top constituent issues that come through their door, there are complaints about the NDIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Labor built the NDIS. We support the NDIS. We believe it is the right framework to provide services to people with a disability. It will empower people with a disability to make decisions about their own care requirements and will give independence to them and their families that hasn't always been available before. We support the extra investment in the provision of it. But we don't support a government that's botching the rollout, that leaves people under-resourced through their packages or that makes it very difficult to get packages approved, with people enduring long waits for either equipment or services. That is the issue we have. We know from the budget paper that there have been significant underspends in this program. Those significant underspends are propping up the government's bottom line. There is no doubt about it. You can't have underspends totalling $6 billion over two fiscal years—and we'll wait for the update tomorrow—and pretend that that is not helping you when you're trying to deliver a budget surplus. Absolutely it is. It is a big program with big underspends and a lot of unhappiness in the community about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the questions we're asking, and what did we get? We got non-answers. I have to say this is becoming a feature of this government's attitude to question time. The response from us is that we will have to take points of order because our questions aren't being answered. We are experiencing non-answer time. It looks like every minister either isn't across their brief or has been given specific instructions not to answer any question they may get asked. Questions may, if we're lucky, get taken on notice. I've rarely seen one of those come back through. But these details that we asked about today should be known to ministers and those representing other ministers in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the waiting list? How long have people waited for care?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the current wait time for the NDIS package? How many people with disability and their families are going without vital services because of the government's delayed rollout? Can the minister confirm that people are receiving just 50 per cent of the approved value of their first NDIS plan? All are quite simple questions that deserve an answer, and they deserve an answer because people are coming to our offices and complaining about the difficulty they have in accessing NDIS services or in getting the care that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can go through a number of examples where people have reached out to Labor offices to talk about the difficulty they've had in getting a response from the NDIA. We're not going to blame this all on the NDIA. They have been unfairly restricted by the staffing cap that this government has imposed on them. They can't employ the staff they need to deliver the services that people are demanding. That's one way to control demand. We heard from the minister that it's a demand driven system. It's actually hard to deliver that when you don't have the people in the jobs to approve the packages and support the people to transition to the NDIS. That is a conscious decision of this government. They are the ones who could overturn that and ensure that the NDIA is properly resourced with the skills and capabilities that are required for the long term instead of relying on contractors to come in and deal with a crisis. That would allow more people to get through and for those people to have the support they need through their own packages and to make their decisions—delivering the vision that was always intended for the NDIS. Unfortunately, this government has taken a different approach. It's constraining demand and it is, at the same time, propping up its budget. We will see tomorrow just how much of their final budget outcome is propped up off the back of people with disability not receiving care.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:06</span>):  I'm quite happy to rise in this place and defend the government's performance with respect to the NDIS rollout. I, personally, representing the good people of Queensland, find it an outstanding performer, and I think the facts actually support that argument. Can I say at the outset what an outstanding job the Minister for the NDIS, the member for Fadden, from my home state of Queensland, is doing. I've heard a number of members in the lower house congratulating the minister with respect to the proactive nature of his office. When concerns are raised, as they inevitably will be with a massive rollout of this nature, they are attended to, and that's the way it should be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This notion that in some way the government is artificially trying to prevent services getting through to those who need them in order to protect the budget bottom line is quite absurd. There is absolutely no evidence to support that assertion. I am sure that every single senator sitting in this place wants that service provided to the people who need it as quickly and as efficiently as possible, and that is exactly what the government is doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of just bland assertions, let's actually look at some of the facts in relation to the matter. The NDIS has undergone significant growth, from approximately 30,000 participants at the end of trials on 30 June 2016 to almost 300,000 participants as at 30 June 2019—an increase of 270,000. Significantly, 100,000 of those participants, 100,000 Australians in need, are receiving support and services for the very first time. So from my perspective, as a senator for the great state of Queensland, this rollout is occurring effectively and efficiently and it's delivering services to those people in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the commencement of the NDIS, the active provider market has also grown from around 3,500 service providers, as at 30 June 2016, to more than 21,000, as at 30 June 2019—an increase of 600 per cent. Again, look at the facts. The facts support the government's case that this system, one of the biggest social reforms in this country's history, with its bipartisan support, is being rolled out effectively and efficiently and delivering services to those in need. We know, the government knows, that the number of participants entering the NDIS is lower than originally estimated. It's a demand driven system, and Minister Ruston tried to explain that in the face of constant interjection from our friends opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As at 30 June 2019, there were 298,816 participants who had received disability support from the NDIS, representing 72 per cent of the original bilateral estimates. This progress has been consistent throughout the NDIS trial and transition phase. In large part, this reflects the shift from block funded services, where data on individuals receiving services was not robust. Despite the best efforts of the NDIA, as well as Commonwealth and state and territory governments, there are some people who may be eligible for the NDIS who remain difficult to contact and engage with. And it's incumbent on every senator in this place and our friends in the House of Representatives to do our best to make sure the people in our community get the services they need as quickly and as efficiently as possible. And the government is doing exactly that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of existing Commonwealth and state and territory clients transitioning to the NDIS has been lower than originally estimated. We accept that. But, the fact of the matter is, the scheme is being rolled out effectively and efficiently, and it is delivering services to those in need. For those examples where people are falling between the cracks, each and every person representing their state or their local seat in this place needs to bring those facts and circumstances to the attention of the relevant minister and the relevant agencies and do their best to advocate on behalf of those people to make sure they get the benefit and services they deserve as Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Delivering this groundbreaking reform to improve outcomes for Australians with a significant and permanent disability will inevitably involve challenges. The important thing is to address issues quickly and efficiently as they arise to ensure the sustainable management of the scheme into the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  That contribution from Senator Scarr was disappointing and, quite frankly, just plain sad, because I'm sure Senator Scarr actually believes exactly what he said in his contribution. He talked about facts and he talked about the scheme being rolled out efficiently and effectively. But let's look at some of the facts. Senator Gallagher, in her contribution when she talked about question time being a non-answer, is spot on. That's exactly what's happened here today. When I asked Senator Ruston three questions, she didn't answer any of them. She didn't answer any one. She took the first one on notice, she took the second one on notice and for the third one she said, 'We don't comment on individual cases.' That's what she said, so she didn't answer. And then we've got Senator Scarr who wants to talk about the facts and about this program. Well, 77,000 people are actually missing out on the NDIS, so that's your efficient and effective rollout. That's what that means to those people that are out there, waiting and trying to get the services that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the facts: we've had about six ministers in six years. That's a problem. Nobody stays in this portfolio area for very long, and they haven't got a handle on what they need to be doing. We have no CEO; the CEO resigned and we still have no CEO. We've had $1.6 billion taken out of the NDIS, and that is money that should stay in the NDIS for services and supports for participants. That's where that money should stay. It shouldn't go back to prop up your budget. That is what is happening. You put a staffing cap on the NDIS. Everyone knows—the Productivity Commission knows—that that needs to go. There are not enough people to roll this out efficiently and effectively, because you have hamstrung the NDIA by putting in a staffing cap. You put a review in and you didn't listen to the recommendations. There was a recommendation that the staffing cap needed to be reviewed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to come in here and highlight the cases where people are missing out. We've had cases where a participant who suffered from progressive spastic paraplegia was told he was not disabled enough. If that doesn't tell you that there's an issue around training and that you need to put some more effort into it, then I don't know what's going to. But there's one thing that we can be sure of in terms of what is happening with the government's rollout of the NDIS: it is not happening effectively or efficiently. I'm sure Senator Scarr's contribution was a contribution he believed in. But the facts do not bear out his contribution at all. We're looking at 77,000 people missing out because of delays, because of the issues around plans—and that doesn't even go to the fact that, on average, people are using only 50 per cent of their first plan. Why do you think that is? It is because the services are not there—that is why. And whose responsibility is that? It's the NDIA and this government. This government is responsible for the rollout. It's responsible to ensure that it is working efficiently and effectively. And it is not. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  The federal coalition government takes the rollout of the NDIS scheme very seriously. The facts and figures will support this. The NDIS continues to grow at a rapid pace. Progress is being made to enable every Australian with a significant and permanent disability to access the reasonable and necessary support they need to participate fully in their communities. As at 30 June 2019, 21,500 service providers had been registered. The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, launched in July 2018, continues to manage provider registrations in New South Wales and South Australia. It commenced operations in all other states on 1 July this year, except Western Australia, where operations will commence in July next year. As at 30 June this year, the NDIS was operating fully in all regions of each state and territory, except four regions in Western Australia. They will join the NDIS in July 2019, and Christmas and Cocos islands will join the NDIS in July next year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the NDIS is supporting people from existing state, territory and Commonwealth systems, and people who have never received any Commonwealth support previously. Currently 99,000 people are receiving supports for the first time. As at 30 June this year, 298,816 people with disabilities, including children in the ECEI program, have been supported by the NDIS. This represents an eight per cent increase in the number of participants over the last quarter. An additional 27,853 participants, excluding children in the ECEI program, received approved plans this quarter.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to continuing to work with the NDIA and state and territory governments to ensure the success of the NDIS. The insurance approach allows pressures on the NDIS to be identified early and allows NDIA management to put in place strategies to respond to these pressures. In the fourth quarter of June 2018, 27,853 participants had their plans approved. A further 5,312 children were referred through the NDIS gateway. Of those who were surveyed in the fourth quarter, 94 per cent reported their planner listened to them, 94 per cent considered that they had enough time to tell their story and 95 per cent thought their meeting planning had gone well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS achieved 93 per cent of its operational target across 2018-19, meaning 108,478 of the 116,000 actionable records were processed. Between 2013 and 2019, 298,000 participants had approved plans, and 5,312 children were being supported through the NDIS ECEI gateway. This scheme has been within budget each financial year since it started, including the 2018-19 financial year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can provide more detail on the plan approval performance for the period up to June 2019, nationally and for each state and territory. New South Wales had a total transition of 95,000 people, taking it up to 104,000. Victoria had a transition of 73,000; Queensland, 51,000; WA, 6,000—that's yet to commence ramp-up; South Australia, 21,000; Tasmania, almost 6,000; ACT, 3,000; and the Northern Territory, 3,000.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIA is committed to building positive outcomes for participants and their families and carers. The agency uses the NDIS Outcomes Framework questionnaires as one of the key tools to assess the medium- and long-term benefits of the scheme. To assess the longitudinal impact of the NDIS, participants who entered the scheme in 2016-17 were asked, 'Has the NDIS helped?' after one and two years in the scheme, allowing the NDIA to gain a better understanding of the longer term impact of the scheme. During the June quarter, participants who entered the scheme in 2016-17, who have now been in the scheme for two years, were also asked this question. Survey results from this new group of participants have built on the results of the previous quarters, supporting the trend that outcomes— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  What a disappointing answer the Minister representing the Minister for the NDIS gave today in question time. She was asked three questions first up by Senator Brown. She took two questions on notice, and she made one 'we don't comment'. Then, when asked by Senator Gallagher about the total underspend on the NDIS in the fiscal years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, interestingly enough the minister did not deny that there was an underspend. But what she did was say, 'Well, I'll bring the budget books in'–a sort of condescending answer that, to be honest, I didn't expect from Senator Ruston. But she did not deny at all that there was an underspend, and that tells us a lot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Responsibility for the management of the NDIS has been with that side of the chamber, as a third-term government, for a very long time now. I think it was Senator Brown who said there have already been six different ministers in the last six years. You can't get someone to really commit to it on your side, I presume. We've now got Stuart Robert as the minister now, who is just failing so abysmally in the management of this important scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme is there to meet the needs of some of the most vulnerable people in Australian society. And what do you guys do? You stand up and read out some facts. You make it sound good, but the reality is that you are not making the scheme work. The scheme is not working.</span>

                  </a>  It is not working, Senator Rennick. You've ripped billions of dollars out of the NDIS. You've failed to address the exodus by the executive of the National Disability Insurance Agency. You have now been without a CEO there since April—over a hundred days. You haven't even bothered to replace the CEO there. That's just a disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what you are doing, and what your side seems particularly intent on doing, is propping up the budget. And how are you doing that? You're doing that by underspending on the NDIS, while people living with a disability are missing out. They're missing out on care and support that is so important to their everyday living. Your government could take much more action on making sure that people get to live with dignity. And what do you do? You go along and cap the staffing levels. What does that do? Let's think about it. You cap the staffing levels, people go to their specialist and their doctors, they get told what their needs are, they get support for it, and they go along, but there are no staff there to deal with the issues. People are on waiting lists that are months long even to get their plans looked at. It's a disgrace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what: for somebody with a person in their family who lives with a disability every day, this is exceptionally close to my heart. You would not believe how close to my heart this is. And when I hear stories and have constituents come to me and tell me that they've been denied something by the NDIS that will make their life just that little bit easier, and they're denied it even though their GP, their medical specialist and their carers have asked for it, I think you guys should hang your heads in shame. It is an absolute disgrace. And I have seen that so many times you would not believe it.</span>

                  </a>  They do, Senator Wong—absolutely. They come to us all the time. But they should not have to. The system should be working so that people can get their needs met so that they can live with dignity. It's pretty easy for you guys, sitting there in your little ivory towers. Do you have anyone in your family living with a disability? Do you have anyone in your family who is a paraplegic or a quadriplegic? Because I tell you what: if you did, I think you would be looking at this whole thing a little bit differently. You wouldn't be standing up and reading out pages of gumpf when the minister representing the minister in this place cannot tell us and will not even say that there is no underspend. She did not say that; let's be very clear— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in a climate emergency. We've just seen unprecedented fires in northern New South Wales and Queensland. The Murray-Darling is running dry. Half of the Great Barrier Reef is going or gone. We have farmers who are being pushed to the wall because our climate is changing as a result of the burning of coal, oil and gas right now. We have emergency services workers who are telling us that fires are now no longer able to be fought, and we are putting the lives of firefighters at risk. We have a community who understand just how critical it is that we come together, take action and ensure that we keep fossil fuels in the ground, that we not open up more coal mines and that we not open up more gas wells for gas exports. And yet what's the response from this government? We have a government that deny the science. We have a water minister who doesn't believe that climate change is caused by people. We have a government that is too busy listening to their donors to act with the urgency that's required. And many people are despairing for their futures.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What gives me hope is that young people right around the country understand how urgent the situation is, and they're taking action. Young people right around the world are coming together—organising. Many of them are people who are absolutely clear about what is required. I've met many of them myself. They're wonderful people—students, people who understand the urgency that is required. I was so proud to be marching with those climate strikers only a few weeks ago; people who inspired us to take the action that is necessary. I was out there with my kids, because it's the future of my children and their generation that's at stake. These young people of today are the leaders of tomorrow. I hope that amongst them will be the next leader of the Greens and, hopefully, the next Prime Minister of this country, because they are showing the courage that is so sadly lacking in this place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the response from the government to the climate strike? It's to say, 'Do it in your own time'; to come down on them; to say to young students that we need more education and less activism. No! Right now activism is what's required. We need people taking it to the streets, mobilising and organising like never before, because in this place what we have is the power of vested interests—the coal, oil and gas industries donating millions of dollars into the pockets of both major parties. We see those interest groups represented in here, not the views of the community, of people who understand the emergency that's confronting us. What we get is the bidding of the fossil fuel industry expressed in our democratic parliaments. Well, they will not win, because we are seeing a movement of people like never before calling on parliaments right around the world to do what's required. They understand that we are in a climate emergency; they understand that this is an existential threat; and they understand the power of ordinary people coming together, expressing their will through civil disobedience and peaceful protest, marching in the streets and ensuring that their voices are heard.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We stand with them. We'll be joining the climate strikers this Friday. We'll be joining the millions of people coming together right across the world and we'll make sure that we bring their voices into this chamber. We'll communicate loudly and clearly their message that we need 100 per cent renewable energy; that we have to keep fossil fuels in the ground; that we can't open up new coal, oil and gas wells; and that the donations from the fossil fuel lobby have to stop. It is the Greens in this parliament who will join with those climate strikers right around the world to ensure that the legacy we leave for future generations is one that allows them at least a chance of turning things around, because our planet depends upon it.</span>

                  </a>  Adrian Drane passed away peacefully on 16 September 2019. Adrian was until recently the principal of Marist Regional College in Burnie, where he was a respected and loved contributor to his local community. Adrian's contribution extended well beyond the schoolyard. He took it on himself to help Tasmania's homeless, victims of bushfires and even those who experienced some of the unimaginable abuse uncovered by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Adrian displayed every quality you could hope for in a leader of the next generations of young Australians. The fact that Adrian Drane is irreplaceable is all the more a shame because the world could do with a few more of him. On behalf of the Senate I offer my condolence to his wife and best friend, Sue; to his children, Mitchell and Zoe; to his broader family; and to the Marist community. He was one of the good ones.</span>

                  </a>  The government recognises the difficult times farmers, irrigators and communities are facing during drought. In December 2018 the government, with the agreement of all Murray-Darling Basin water ministers, delivered a social and economic neutrality test. The test ensures that the delivery of additional water for the environment will have no social or economic impacts on farmers and communities. The coalition government will continue to fully implement the Basin Plan while ensuring that delivery of additional water for the environment does not hurt basin communities.</span>

                  </a>  In southern New South Wales we have a farmer growing oats who usually expects six tonnes per hectare if irrigated. He's now harvesting 0.5 of a tonne per hectare. In another paddock, for hay, he typically has 130 semitrailer loads of hay. He'll be lucky to get seven this time. He has no water allocation, yet there are environmental flows flooding the back of his farm. These environmental flows had happened four of the last six years, and that's unnatural. We request that this not be passed.</span>

If caught early, 90 per cent of bowel cancers can be successfully treated. The Morrison government has recently invested $10 million in an advertising blitz to boost participation in this free and lifesaving program. The government encourages a healthy and balanced diet in accordance with the Australian Dietary Guidelines. These guidelines outline that Australians should enjoy a wide variety of nutritious foods, including lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts and seeds, legumes and beans.</span>

                  </a>  Labor will also be opposing this motion, not because we don't support the great work undertaken by Bowel Cancer Australia, but because, as we've seen within a lot of motions this week, the Greens are writing their motions with a deliberate view to dividing the Senate. Subclause (ii) of this motion goes directly to that point. I think the other elements of the motion are fine. Meat Free Week is a great campaign. It is an important message that people can make little changes to their diet, but the Greens have inserted a paragraph that puts us all in a difficult position, because people across the Senate will have different views about this. Every motion they are moving at the moment has a clause like this. This section of the program, as I have said a number of times, is about things where there is generally consensus. This is just getting to be a bit more than a joke, to be honest.</span>

                  </a>  Labor will not be supporting this motion. The real solution here is for the Morrison government to come up with a proper drought package for all drought affected communities rather than to have more committees. All Australians would be concerned by the reports of towns facing the possibility of running out of water, and the potential for suffering and distress as a consequence. After six years of inaction on water security, the government must act now to help those communities running out of water. The problem here is that, despite being in office for six years, the government has failed to act beyond establishing a range of committees and positions. We've had a drought envoy, a drought coordinator, a drought task force and a drought summit, and now we're told the Morrison government will establish a Water Grid Authority. Rural Australia does not need committees or task forces; it needs help to endure one of the most serious challenges to the viability of some of our great inland towns and regional centres. The Prime Minister is out of touch. He needs to get to work on a practical plan to cope with the drought crisis.</span>

While I understand that there is huge heartache in many parts of the Murray-Darling Basin and that small family farms have their back against the wall, that is the fault, of course, of this government, with six years of mismanagement. If you really want to find someone to blame, it's Mr Barnaby Joyce, who took water from the environment—he bragged about it—to give to his big corporate mates. Until we crack down on big corporate cotton sucking up all the water and leaving nothing for anyone else, we are not going to be able to solve this problem.</span>

                    </a>  Labor will not be supporting this inquiry. For six months now the government has been sitting on the comprehensive report by the Australian Law Reform Commission into the Family Court system. This is a report that this government itself commissioned in September 2017. This and other reviews have already identified the problems facing the family courts, as well as the hardship, and in some cases the tragedy, these problems are causing for thousands of Australian families. Women are being murdered every week in Australia, and children are dying as a result of family violence. Labor cannot support any proposal to further delay or undermine action on this critical issue. We are especially disturbed by statements this morning that the purpose of the inquiry has been predetermined, even before the parliament had agreed it should go ahead, and in particular the focus on attacking women who report allegations of family violence.</span>

                    </a>  This motion is a stitch-up between the government and One Nation, and there is no doubt there are predetermined outcomes in play here. The committee is not fit for purpose. The fact that One Nation will co-chair this inquiry with its anti-women, anti-children agenda should tell us all we need to know about its integrity and independence. The Australian Law Reform Commission's review into the family law system was tabled in April this year and contained 60 recommendations to place children at the centre of the system. The government is yet to respond to those recommendations. They are what the government should be focusing on, not engaging in dangerous, rank politicking on a complex issue, which is exactly what will happen at this inquiry. The Greens will not be supporting this motion.</span>

The chair of this committee, as announced by the Prime Minister, is intended to be Kevin Andrews, who's got great experience in this difficult policy area, having been part of an inquiry in relation to this issue back in 1991. What we have indicated is that, should this committee be set up, we will be supporting Senator Hanson to be elected as the deputy chair.</span>

They are an opportunity historically to explain one's position. I ask senators to keep that in mind, because only so few senators get given the chance. Any one senator can deny any other senator leave, so show some courtesy towards one's colleagues.</span>

                  </a>  One Nation opposes the motion from Senator Whish-Wilson. The Gulf of Carpentaria fin fish fishery is a limited entry, quota managed, semidemersal trawl fishery that has operated under the jurisdiction of the Queensland Fisheries Joint Authority since June 1988. The fishery remains developmental, and any change to a licence status depends on it continuing to demonstrate ecological sustainability, commercial viability and social acceptability. The fishery is heavily managed, and One Nation believes those restrictions are quite sufficient. The additional layers of environmental green tape and blue tape suggested by the Greens will serve to destroy commercial fishing opportunities for high-value fish species. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Greens have failed again to do is link fishing with the reduction in fish stocks of the river shark and sawfish. Again, there is no data. One Nation proposes to allow the Queensland government to get on with managing this fishery without interference. </span>

To enable them to do so, the government provides a range of payments and targeted supports, including the disability support pension, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and concession cards. The assessment process for DSP is an application for access to a pension for an extended period of time—usually many years. It is appropriate that the process is rigorous to ensure consistency and equality and ensure support goes to those who need it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  We've had six years of Liberal federal governments. We've had the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments. With that, we've had three ministers who have failed older Australians. We have a new minister, who unfortunately demonstrated in question time yesterday, and again today, that he isn't across his brief whatsoever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we go back to the last Labor government, when there were major reforms in aged care in this country and the foundational Living Longer Living Better reforms were brought forward, we see that we did that in a bipartisan manner. The former minister, Mark Butler, engaged with those who were then in opposition. It says a lot about the calibre of those opposite that back then they were willing to work in the interests of all older Australians, but over the last six years—and it's been reaffirmed since the election of the Morrison government—all they have done is use the aged-care sector as a cash cow, an ATM. The Prime Minister has told the Australian people—in particular, older Australians—that he is a Prime Minister who is going to make aged care a priority. Well, we'd better get the facts on the table, on the record. When he was the Treasurer he cut $1.2 billion out of the aged-care sector. The Turnbull-Morrison governments have been taking money out of this sector year after year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we on this side of the chamber say—and we've said this countless times—is that we are willing to work with the government to bring about the reforms that are necessary to fix the broken aged-care sector in this country, because older Australians deserve nothing less, and families of older Australians deserve nothing less. But we have seen a continuum of failed ministers who haven't been across their portfolios. Quite frankly, I don't think they have demonstrated any real interest in older Australians. And we should be ashamed of that from the government of the day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have a minister who has not been able to answer the simplest of questions, which is: how many older Australians who have been approved for their home care package are still waiting for a package? Now, we know it's in excess of 120,000 older Australians. We know that too many older Australians are dying after they have already had their home care package approved. That is unacceptable in this country. It is totally unacceptable for a country as rich as we are here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that around two in three older Australians accessing aged-care services are women. They need to be assured that the support they're getting in their own homes is of the standard that they deserve. We need to know that all checks and balances have been carried out with the service providers. We also need this government—after the failings of the Abbott and Turnbull governments, and now the Morrison government—to address one of the big outstanding issues in relation to aged care in this country, which is that we do not have the workforce we need to ensure that older Australians get the care they need. We are not attracting people to come and work in this very important sector. Why aren't they coming to work? Because (a) they don't get the respect that they deserve, (b) they're certainly not remunerated to the level they deserve and (c) they know they do not have the support of the federal government. That has been demonstrated day after day by the failure of those who are on the government benches now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia, we know, has a rapidly ageing population. It's not unique to Australia, but what we have to do is work together to ensure we have the best system possible in this country. The issue of our ageing population is not going to go away. We have to address it. We have to provide support to the sector so that we can attract the number of people we need to care and support older Australians, whether they're living in residential care or whether they are being supported in their own homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are always going to be shonky providers or people that really aren't up to the job of caring for people in their own homes. That's why we need to ensure that we have checks and balances in place. We need to ensure that people are meeting the security checks. We need to ensure that the training in this country is uniform. We have done so many inquiries into the aged-care sector in this country. Today in question time we talked about a number of the reports of those inquiries, like the Tune report. All those recommendations have been on the table for two years or more, and they still haven't been fully enacted. We know there have been at least 14 reports over the last six years and they are gathering dust in the minister's office. It's not good enough. To counter all of those reports, after six years of the government's own failing, they had to call a royal commission into their unsuccessful governance of this important sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Older Australians deserve so much more. Today in question time, when the minister was able to at least give us some sort of response, he said, 'We're not going to do anything until the final report is handed down from the royal commission.' Well, that's just not good enough. The government has had report after report. We have offered to sit down and work with the government to bring about the changes that are needed. We have had recommendations in a report from Mr David Tune, a very respected former public servant. The Carnell report has been ignored. There were only 10 recommendations in that report, and they haven't all been implemented. Why not? I don't like to say it, but I do firmly believe that this government, like the Abbott-Turnbull governments of the past, just do not prioritise older Australians to the level that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past six years, as demonstrated now with Senator Colbeck as minister, the government have never had a cabinet minister responsible for this important public service area. We did. Former Minister Mark Butler was in cabinet. Before the last election, Labor gave the commitment that, if we were to win office, our minister responsible for aged care and older Australians would be in cabinet, where ministers have the authority to sit around the cabinet table, where the real decisions are made. But what have we got? We have a minister who is the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians and the Minister for Youth and Sport. I think it says a little bit about his capacity as a minister when he doesn't represent a minister from the other place. He's the only minister sitting in the Senate who doesn't rep another minister. That is a telling factor—it really is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we are prepared to work with them, but after six years we have three failed ministers and a minister now who's obviously just not up to the task, who can't even answer simple questions in relation to the home care package waiting list in this country. He hasn't got an answer for the families of the 16,000 Australians who died after having an assessment made and before getting a package. That's the calibre of the minister that we have in this place, in this government, at this time. It is absolutely shameful. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  Well, what an invitation that was for bipartisanship! We just heard from Senator Polley reflecting on how, in the past, people across the chamber have worked together constructively in a bipartisan manner, and then Senator Polley gets up and gives the speech she just gave. That's hardly an invitation to work together on a bipartisan basis!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have three preliminary points. Firstly, older Australians in this country voted overwhelmingly for the re-election of the coalition government at the last federal election. In my home state of Queensland, older Australians voted overwhelmingly for the re-election of the coalition government. Why? Because this government delivers for older Australians. Secondly, if you wanted to engage constructively on a bipartisan basis with the government in relation to these issues, you would not present a resolution in the nature of this one, which talks about 'inaction', 'cuts' and a 'broken aged-care system'. Broken? Seriously? Does anyone really believe that our aged-care system is broken? It could be better. It could always be better, but broken? The evidence just does not support this assertion. And, lastly, in the spirit of bipartisanship, the reflections on the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck, were totally unnecessary. How can you expect to engage constructively in a bipartisan manner after the sort of rhetoric we just heard from Senator Polley?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whenever I hear the Labor Party talk about cuts, whether it be cuts to aged-care services, cuts to education or cuts to health, I always know that, when you look at the figures and you look at the evidence, the evidence will be totally to the contrary. So what is the evidence? Since the coalition government was elected, aged-care spending has increased every single year. That's not a cut; that's an increase. One billion dollars of extra support for older Australians each year on average is not a cut; that's an increase. If the funding is more year on year, that is not a cut. That's an increase. Funding to aged care continues to grow, with our government investing an additional $7 billion in aged care over five years. That's not a cut; that's an increase. The Morrison government is delivering record investment—not cuts!—across the aged-care system over the forward estimates, growing from $13.3 billion in 2012-13 under Labor to $21.7 billion in 2019-20 to an estimated $25.4 billion in 2020-23, and this is characterised as a cut. It's not a cut. Making improvements to aged care for all senior Australians continues to be one of the Morrison government's key priorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our recent track record in improving aged care, including since the royal commission was called, is extensive—not inaction, but action. We've invested $2.2 billion since the 2018-19 budget into home care packages to support more Australians to remain living in their own homes for longer. There's been a 25 per cent increase in access to home care packages in just one year. Is this a broken system? Does anyone actually truly believe this is a broken system? If you want to improve the system in the spirit of bipartisanship, maybe you could leave the overblown rhetoric and hyperbole at home, seriously. The federal government has released 14,275 new residential care places, including 13½ thousand residential places and 775 short-term restorative care places; allocated $60 million in capital grants for infrastructure works in rural and remote areas; established a new independent Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission; implemented new consumer focused Aged Care Quality Standards—there are a lot of actions here to read; put in place a new single Charter of Aged Care Rights covering 14 fundamental protections for all aged-care programs from safety, quality care, independence, information, personal privacy, control, fairness and choice; implemented new provider requirements to minimise physical and chemical restraint in residential aged care; and introduced the new National Aged Care Mandatory Quality Indicator Program. I have a page here of actions, not inaction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has provided a $320 million boost to residential care subsidies; invested $21 million for 13 research projects that will focus on risk reduction, prevention and tracking of dementia; established a specialist dementia care program; implemented an aged-care diversity framework; expanded the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Flexible Aged Care Program by approximately $50 million over four years; provided a capital grant of $20 million to establish a new aged-care service for First Nations people; and provided $4 million to increase aged-care services to people mainly in rural and remote locations through the multipurpose services program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are more actions—action upon action! The federal government has provided funding of up to $3 million to engage with organisations who assist aged-care providers delivering services under the NATSIFACP to transition to the new aged-care quality standards and allocated grants totalling $3.5 million to aged-care providers delivering aged-care services to Indigenous people to purchase equipment and undertake minor works. It would have been nice to have at least heard one word from those opposite that the government is undertaking action in this sector. If those opposite truly want to engage in this process in a bipartisan fashion then due respect needs to be given to the work that's been done in this area. The federal government has provided an additional $4 million to deliver more-flexible aged-care places, provided an ongoing 30 per cent increase to the viability supplement to support services in rural and remote Australia, provided an ongoing 30 per cent increase to the homeless supplement, giving providers operating residential and home care access to independent business advisory services, and provided $5.6 million in 2019-20 to implement phase 1 of a home care compliance framework.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what the Labor Party characterises as inaction and cuts. All the evidence is to the contrary. We all know that when the Labor Party accuses a coalition government of cuts all the evidence will be to the contrary. There have been increases year on year in government spending. Let's compare that to the Labor record. In terms of new home care packages, these have increased, not been cut, from 60,308 under Labor in 2012-13 to 125,117 in 2018-19—an increase. It went from 60,308 to 125,117. They're scheduled to increase to a further 157,154 in 2022-23—a 161 per cent increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have absolutely no credibility when they bring to this chamber a resolution which talks about inaction, cuts and a broken aged-care system. The people in our aged-care system, the workers in that system, are working terribly hard. The system is not broken. This government is delivering for our elderly Australians—absolutely delivering for them—and that is why at the last federal election the people in my home state of Queensland gave a resounding tick of approval to the re-election of the coalition government.</span>

                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  Thank you, Mr President, and may I congratulate you on your re-election to the presidency. I have been entrusted by the people of the Northern Territory to represent their best interests. To me, this is an honour of the highest order—one which I humbly accept with great respect, devotion and reverence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that I am standing here before you as an Australian federal senator is proof that, with a little bit of work and determination, any Australian can achieve anything in this country. I was not born into wealth, education, business or politics; rather, I was born into a working-class suburban Sydney family of my mother and maternal grandparents, with my mother being the sole support for the family. Although born in the city, I was regaled with tales by my grandmother of the country, and that was something that I longed for. At the age of seven, the family moved to Queensland, settling in the small country town of Nanango in the South Burnett. I claim I was baptised in the Tweed River when I crossed the border into Queensland, becoming a passionate Queenslander.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Growing up in Nanango forged the determination in me. From the age of 10 I worked to help eke a living out of 70 acres. I chopped wood, milked cows, fed pigs, turkeys and chickens and justified having a horse by contract mustering on the weekends. Eventually it became apparent that a small farm wasn't going to sustain a family of four, and just when it looked like we would have to move along came Tarong coal, and my mother secured a job at the soon to be power station—see, Matt, I worked coal into that for you!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I was schooled at the Nanango State School, going on to complete a Bachelor of Veterinary Science at the University of Queensland. Graduating at 21, I headed straight up to the Northern Territory—a chance trip four years earlier had seen me fall madly in love with the place. Most of my early days working in the NT were spent in a swag under the stars and beside a camp fire as I travelled to many of the iconic remote cattle stations. Apart from the veterinary work, in my down time, I got to muster cattle, shoot out of helicopters, catch wild buffalo in a bull catcher, drive road trains, live in stock camps and work alongside some of the best ringers from the Top End.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To many Australians, the NT is an enigma. They know it exists. It has a rock, a park, and a city named after some guy who discovered swimming iguanas, but that is often as much as they know. I'm supremely proud of our past. The Northern Territory has an Indigenous history dating back over 50,000 years, and there are at least 100 Aboriginal languages still spoken. Traditions and culture are an interwoven part of society. Macassan traders have been coming to the Northern Territory since at least 1650, and Chinese explorers and traders probably even earlier.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In modern times, we are derived from more than two centuries of challenges coloured by people, events, catastrophes and triumph, both nationally and on the world stage. These challenges have been as relentless and diverse as they were arduous and our collective forebears have consistently risen to meet these trials. In 1861, John McDouall Stuart set off from Adelaide on his sixth expedition to attempt to cross the continent from south to north, eventually succeeding. His expedition paved for the way for the completion of the overland telegraph line. In his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Hell West and Crooked</span>, Tom Cole wrote:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The overland telegraph line is steeped in history, adventure and romance, and must rank as one of the greatest accomplishments in Australia's pioneering history. Before the line was built, the only form of communication Australia had with the outside world was by ship. And even with the advent of steam, mail took a minimum of six weeks between England and Australia. It took 18 months to construct 2,000 miles of telephone line through what was virtually an unknown wilderness with bullock wagons, pack horses and camels … </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the small places set up in those days to service the line are still towns and roadhouses today, including my home of Katherine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The 1870s and 1880s saw a large pastoral boom. Mrs Dominic Daly reported in her book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Digging, Squatting and Pioneering Life in the Northern Territory </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> South Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>in 1879:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Notwithstanding all these difficulties and dangers … a steady stream of emigration from the pastoral district of Queensland flowed into the richly grassed and well watered lands of the Northern Territory. All that was needed to make squatting a success, when the young stock was matured, was a suitable market, and this it was hoped would be found in India, Java, and the Strait settlements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, by 1893, Victoria River Downs station was shipping cattle to Batavia via Singapore. In fact, the live cattle trade has only had one official break, in 2011 when the then Labor minister for agriculture banned it for six months. This had a devastating impact on the pastoral industry, with many pastoralists still struggling to recover today. Around that same time, mining was starting to take off, with discoveries of gold, tin, silver, lead, copper and wolfram. Some of these mines from the 1800s are still in production today. Mining and the pastoral industry sustained much of the Territory in its early years, and still does to this day, and then came a series of challenges.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I am encouraged today that the bombing of Darwin, on 19 February 1942, is better recognised and acknowledged, but much of the war effort, which encompassed the whole of the Northern Territory, is still little known. More than 82,000 kilograms of bombs were dropped on Darwin during the first Japanese bombing raid, far more than what was dropped on Pearl Harbor. Eleven ships were sunk, 27 Allied aircraft destroyed, civilian and military buildings were extensively damaged, and 235 people were killed. Japanese aircraft conducted more than 100 missions to the Territory, including one to Katherine—the furthest inland raid on Australia—where two people were killed and one injured.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Army had major operational bases throughout the NT. The North Australia Observer Unit, or Curtin's cowboys, after which the present day NORFORCE was modelled, patrolled remote areas of rivers and coastline to safeguard against Japanese landings. The first Japanese prisoner of war captured on Australian soil was in the Top End, on Melville Island. The Japanese midget submarine raids on Sydney Harbour are well taught these days, yet how many know that the corvette HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Deloraine</span> attacked and sank Japanese submarine I-124 off Darwin? It's now a dedicated war grave.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">The positives to come out of the war include sealed roads, airfields, infrastructure and new opportunities. Life was still far from easy though, as local modern-day pastoralist from Katherine, Pat Elliott, recounted to me:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">It is because of people like this that the NT developed itself after the war, emerging strong and determined, but was soon to be dealt another blow. Cyclone Tracy: most of us have heard how it struck Darwin on Christmas Eve 1974. The people of Katherine and the rest of the Territory rallied around and supported the victims—a kindness that was not forgotten, and repaid some 24 years later when Katherine was decimated in the Australia Day floods. We seem to like to stage our national disasters on significant holidays, it would seem!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We may be currently undergoing some difficult times thanks to recent Labor governments, but we have a proven track record of recovering, rebuilding and becoming a better version of ourselves. Currently, one of our greatest challenges, while not unique to the Northern Territory is of major importance to us, is that throughout modern history people of all backgrounds and locations have had one thing in common—they all relocated to find or follow resources that allowed them to survive. It's why we had a nomadic peoples and why we have ghost towns. People went where the resources were, whether that was food, suitable climate for farming or work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This has changed significantly over recent years, particularly in Australia. We, as a society, now expect to stay living in one place and have the resources, in the form of employment or welfare, come to us. As shown by the recent failure of the Seasonal Work Incentives Trial, people are often unwilling to travel even temporarily for work. This has particular importance to the NT, with approximately 60 per cent of our population on some form of welfare, and a high proportion of people in remote Indigenous communities. These communities have grown up in areas for historical reasons, often in proximity to stations or mining camps where a small number of family groups would settle. Modern welfare systems have enabled people to stay in these communities when there is no work and facilitated rapid expansion of the population. We are now grappling with the conundrum of expecting government to create employment, often in very remote areas, where none exists. We need to examine ways to resolve this, with water and energy providing some of the possible keys.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We relish in and prosper from the vast fortunes of our parched and arid nation, but we do so in the knowledge that all bounty delivered to us has always been intertwined with the scarcity of water. So very little water is freely available across so much of our vast expanse that even today we struggle to develop and flourish in the enormous tracts of our land. Established areas of agriculture are beholden to the uncertainty of water, with drought featuring prominently in our history and continuing to do so today. We are smarter, wiser and more experienced now, and today is the right time for us to re-evaluate our capacity to provide better water resources across our nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Arriving at new and innovative solutions may be perplexing and demanding, and I am not in any way going to shy away from meeting those challenges head on. I seek new, inventive and pioneering solutions that transcend our normal thinking, that challenge our science and understanding and that deliver new and revolutionary results. I call upon my colleagues in this government to join me in examining a variety of means of collecting the massive quantities of water delivered by our monsoonal rains across the north and also to develop storage facilities for this vital resource. I call upon my colleagues to evaluate ways of distributing this water for the benefit of Territorians and all Australians to further grow existing agricultural areas, develop new agricultural regions and afford agriculture a level of confidence in water security that exceeds any they have previously held.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We are looking down the barrel of a crisis, a crisis of energy. While some choose to avoid addressing this issue, I choose to hear the voice of the quiet Australians and rise to meet the challenge of resolving this energy issue head on. Surprising to some, albeit obvious to others, is the knowledge that renewable energy products are not the complete solution. Research must continue in the development of renewable technologies, but for commercial use they currently remain immature and, in many cases, fundamentally flawed. The hoax of immature technology replacing safe, clean, reliable and inexpensive power stations has unfolded, and the quiet Australians are no longer content subsidising fanciful ideas that have been uncovered as fraud. We're fed up with the high costs of energy and the uncertainty of renewables. An onshore and offshore oil and gas industry, with areas like the Beetaloo and Amadeus basins currently being explored, can lead to industries and jobs right across the Territory. It has been over 10 years since we last considered nuclear energy as an option for Australia's energy mix, and in this time we have witnessed dramatic advances in technology. The time is right for us to revisit and re-examine options for us to utilise this technology. With approximately 30 per cent of the world's known uranium reserves in the Northern Territory, we have not only the capacity to develop a nuclear industry for our own energy needs but also an advanced fuel export option.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we are at an exciting juncture, poised on the precipice of an exhilarating tomorrow. It is a tomorrow of ubiquitous promise that should offer fortune and prosperity for all Australians. So that we may embrace the bright future ahead, we must first clear the path before us, sweeping away the detritus of identity politics and casting aside the litter of hypocrisy. We must cut through the obstructions of self-interest, and focus our joint energies on achieving real outcomes for all. We must develop innovative and sensible solutions to complex problems and assert our ability to achieve what we aim to achieve. We are compelled to do these things because the quiet Australians told us to and it is in our nation's DNA, while the nonsense of foolishly obstructing or delaying the processes of government is not.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance. I do so because, like colleagues on this side, I recognise that Australia's aged-care system is broken. It is broken because of years of inaction and cuts by the Liberal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, we've marked the anniversary of the announcement of a royal commission into aged care. I note that my colleague, Senator Scarr, was insistent that there was nothing wrong with the aged-care system. Well, why did we need a royal commission? This is a royal commission we so desperately need because our aged-care system is in crisis. After extending the reporting date of the royal commission on Friday, it is vital that this Liberal government acts on what we know is broken today. We cannot wait until November 2020 for action, because 120,000 older Australians are waiting for aged care at home, with waiting times now of more than two years for the highest levels of care. A week does not go by without another disturbing account emerging about the mistreatment or neglect of older Australians in residential care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many other South Australians, I was shocked and appalled at some of the horrific revelations of abuse and poor care of elderly people in care in my state. But this problem has not been confined to South Australia; the royal commission has already heard devastating evidence of mistreatment and neglect across our country. We have heard witnesses give evidence suggesting there are regulators paying lip-service to the welfare of the elderly and who are so desensitised to poor care they're allowing these nursing homes to stay open. Only last month a home on the Gold Coast closed due to a dispute over money, which left nearly 70 elderly residents homeless—an issue that my colleague, Senator Watt, has been more than vocal on. I note the government is yet to examine whether cuts to residential aged-care funding have contributed to the closure of this place. Disturbingly, we've seen reports that a number of other aged-care facilities in Queensland are at a risk of closure due to insufficient federal funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission has heard evidence about one home in Sydney which repeatedly failed dozens of standard inspections over 12 months, at one point only meeting 10 of the 44 standards on quality and safety. We have heard horrific reports regarding malnourishment, neglect, medication mismanagement and abuse incidents in some aged-care homes around our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are things this government can act on now, starting with our workforce. We know that there aren't enough aged-care workers and that they aren't paid enough. Australia is far from having the workforce that is required to care for our ageing population. In 2015-16 almost 240,000 people received permanent residential aged care. The proportion of people aged 65 years or over is projected to increase from 15.3 per cent in 2017 to 22 per cent in 2061, when one in 20 people will be aged 85 years and over. The frailty of residents is also increasing, as people are being admitted at an older age with multiple morbidities. We have seen too much blame placed on aged-care staff for what are systemic, long-term issues mainly caused by funding cuts, poor management, a lack of transparency and accountability and a lack of willingness by the Liberal government to tackle real reform. In fact, it was only last year when former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that aged-care workers could always aspire to a better job. Let me be very clear: aged-care workers deserve our respect; they do not deserve to be berated. Aged-care workers and their unions have been screaming out for reforms and resources, a call that has been completely ignored by this third-term Liberal government. They desperately need these resources so they can continue to do the best job they can for their patients and their residents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The crisis in aged care is a failure of public policy, and, like so many other policy failures under this government, it was not inevitable. It did not have to happen, but it has happened because of this government's hopeless record of inaction and cuts over the last six years. It has happened because of the Prime Minister's cuts to aged care that have contributed to the broken system. And, remember, he was the architect of these cuts. The government has been asleep at the wheel for six years, with four ministers and billions of dollars ripped out of our aged-care system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, the aged-care system lurches from one crisis to another. We've had review after review ignored, with recommendations for fixing Australia's aged care system left to collect dust in different ministerial offices. It is shameful that, in a wealthy country like Australia, older people are not getting the care they need. I spoke to many, many older Australians during the campaign. Some were weeping, begging us to fix this disaster. The government must do better now to ensure older Australians get the quality aged-care services that they deserve, because older Australians and their loved ones cannot wait any longer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been six years since the Liberals formed government. What can we celebrate? Actually, it's hard to think of much at all that they have done well when it comes to aged-care reform, because they don't have a genuine reform agenda. Crisis by crisis, we have seen policy on the run. Clearly, this sector and the people who rely on it are not prioritised by this government. We can see this simply in the fact that they are on their fourth aged-care minister in six years, and this minister is not considered significant enough to be in the cabinet, even though there is a royal commission currently underway. Since the Liberals have been in government, the policy and reform void in this policy space has been startling. Let's start with home care: 120,000 older Australians are waiting for their approved home care package. That is not good enough. In fact, it is just totally unacceptable. More than 16,000 people have died while waiting for their approved package, and 14,000 have had to enter residential aged care because they could not stay at home waiting for care that wasn't there—talk about a policy failure. Others enter emergency departments or the hospital system due to their increasing care needs. Not only is there a distinct lack of packages available, there's also the increasing length of time older Australians have to wait for their approved home care package. Many people approved for the highest level of home care are now waiting more than 24 months to receive their approved packages. Make no mistake, this waiting time is a crisis. Figures included in the most recent government report clearly show that there are more people on the home care package waiting list than there are packages in the system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For years, Labor has been calling on successive Liberal governments to fix the home care package waiting list crisis. We know Australia has a growing ageing population. We also know that more Australians are choosing to age in their own home. They should be able to make that choice. The former minister admitted last year that he needed to intervene. Did he? The next quarterly report on the number of older Australians waiting for care has just been released, and given the seriousness of issue I hope there is no further delay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's track record of inaction continues when it comes to dozens of other reports as well—reviews and inquiries that have been gathering dust on the desk of minister after minister. More than two years ago the Australian Law Reform Commission's final <span style="font-style:italic;">Elder abuse</span> report was tabled in the parliament. Forty-three recommendations were put to government by the Law Reform Commission, the majority of which still have yet to be actioned or fully implemented. Last week it was two years since the report of the Tune review was tabled in the parliament, an important review that gave the government a pathway forward about how to address a number of critical issues impacting on the now broken aged-care system. Thirty-eight recommendations were put to government, many of which still have yet to be fully implemented. In question time today the minister said he was working through them, but it's not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week also marked a year since the minister announced the release of the A Matter of Care workforce strategy, which included 14 actions to address current and future workforce challenges. How many of those 14 actions have been addressed? To date none have been fully implemented. What a disgrace this is, when we know there aren't enough aged-care workers now to care for older Australians, let alone those that will be needed to provide this care over the next decade. And in less than a month it will be two years since the Carnell-Paterson report into regulatory processes was handed to the government. This report has 10 recommendations, many of which, yet again, have yet to be fully implemented. What we have seen over and over are policy failures under this government—policies that are failing older Australians. This government has turned its back on older Australians. It needs to do more. It needs to fix the crisis in aged care.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  I'm a little delighted to come into the chamber this afternoon to talk on this matter of public importance—a little delighted because I'm surprised that Labor continues to proffer this gross mistruth that there has been a reduction in government spending in aged care—just untrue. And I'm not going to ask you to believe me; I'm going to ask you to believe the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and I'll come to that in a moment. The second reason I'm only a little delighted to come into the chamber is it seems that Labor senators are keen to ignore the coalition government's very strong record when it comes to delivering on aged-care achievements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To start, let me provide a quick overview before I demonstrate why the ABC doesn't believe what Labor says this afternoon about aged-care funding. At a higher level, let me put on the record that since the coalition government was elected aged-care spending has increased every single year. It's increased on average by $1 billion of extra support for older Australians each year. Aged-care funding continues to grow, with the government investing an additional $7 billion in aged care over five years. The Morrison government is delivering record investment across the aged-care system over the forward estimates. Funding has increased from just $13.3 billion in 2012-13, Labor's last year in office, to $21.7 billion in 2019-20, to an estimated $25.4 billion in 2022-23. Under our plan aged-care funding will almost double from what it was in the last year under Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as importantly, when Labor had an opportunity in the lead-up to the 18 May federal election, what did they say about aged care? The country was looking at Labor and it was looking at the coalition. Many Australians would have been thinking about the various policies on offer from the coalition, from Labor and from other parties. What did Labor say to Australian electors in the lead-up to the 18 May federal election? When the whole country was looking at Labor to understand what its aged-care priorities were, Labor provided no additional funding in its costings for home care places or any additional funding for aged-care quality, workforce or residential aged care. When the whole country was preparing to go to the ballot box and was thinking about a variety of issues and the various policy positions of Labor and the coalition, you would have thought that would have been a good time for Senator Brown from Tasmania or Senator Ciccone from Victoria to put on the public record what their position was with regard to additional aged-care funding, but they provided nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a quick look at what the ABC said when it examined for itself, last year in September, claims from Bill Shorten that the coalition was cutting aged-care spending. Senator Brown, I know you're not supposed to interject but on this occasion we might be able to excuse you. What did ABC Fact Check say about Bill Shorten's comments? 'Misleading' is what ABC Fact Check said. The claim from Bill Shorten was, it said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's aged care sector has come under close scrutiny in recent weeks following concerns that some providers have placed profit before the welfare of the elderly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard that in Senator Smith's contribution—Senator Smith from South Australia, not Senator Smith from Western Australia. The ABC went on to say that this is what Bill Shorten, the former Leader of the Opposition, said in the House of Representatives:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Why, when he was treasurer, in his first budget, did the now Prime Minister cut $1.2 billion from aged care? How did cutting $1.2 billion from aged care support the dignity of vulnerable older Australians?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what Bill Shorten said to Scott Morrison, who, in September last year, was Prime Minister. What did ABC Fact Check say? It said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">that year the government announced $1.2 billion of "efficiencies" (partly offset by more money in the budget for regional aged care and information services).</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That announcement followed a $2.5 billion increase in the expected cost of the Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI), the main Commonwealth funding mechanism to subsidise aged care service providers, since the budget update just six months earlier.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">"This measure is part of the Government's response to the continued higher than expected growth in ACFI expenditure, which has increased by a further $2.5 billion over the forward estimates since the 2015-16 MYEFO …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That doesn't sound like a cut in aged-care spending. That doesn't sound like one, and it's not one. 'Misleading' is how the comments of the then Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten have been characterised. We heard nothing about that in the contributions of Labor senators this afternoon. If we are going to have a debate about aged care in our country, then it should at least be an honest one and it should at least be a factual one. The challenge is for Labor to focus on the facts, present the real story and then offer up their solution. But what we've heard this afternoon is a false story not based on facts, and we haven't heard any solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contributions from others this afternoon, it's also been suggested that the government has got no achievements to demonstrate in the aged-care policy area. They say, 'Oh, you've had so many ministers, isn't that terrible.' Well, actually, the former minister just became a cabinet minister and is the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. That demonstrates competency, not incompetency. So let me just talk about the 22 achievements that the coalition government can lay claim to. I suspect that, in the next two minutes, I won't have the opportunity to get through all 22, but Senator Brown, you're welcome to come and take my speaking points. If I can only get to 10 or 12, you're welcome to take the other 10!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where should we start? Let's start at the top. Achievement No. 1: the coalition has invested $2.2 billion since the 2018-19 budget into home care packages to support more Australians to remain living in their own homes for longer. That is a good outcome. That is a good achievement. That is necessary. That is what the Australian community is telling us. There's been a 25 per cent increase in access to home care packages in just one year. Achievement No. 2: the coalition has released 14,275 new residential care places, including 13,500 residential places and 775 short-term restorative care places. That is achievement. That is success. That is delivering on the aged-care needs for older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Achievement No. 3: the coalition has allocated $60 million worth of capital grants for infrastructure works in rural and remote areas. As a regional senator, this is critical. Aged-care homes across regional areas in our country do need more support in order to build the infrastructure to support the provision of aged-care services. If you want to have a really important debate about aged care, if you really want to think about the future of aged care and have a proper policy discussion about what the urgency is and what really needs to be done, then it's absolutely about how we make sure that older Australians living in rural and remote areas across our country can stay close to their families and get aged-care support in those rural and remote areas. That is an important policy discussion. I haven't heard that from anyone on Labor's side yet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Achievement No. 4: the coalition has established the new independent Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. Achievement No. 5: the coalition has implemented new consumer focused Aged Care Quality Standards arrangements. Achievement No. 6: the coalition has put in place a new single Charter of Aged Care Rights, covering 14 fundamental protections for all aged-care programs for safe, quality care to independents. That's six achievements of at least 22. I could go on— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What we just heard from Senator Dean Smith, Western Australian Liberal, was a very, very lacklustre contribution. In fact, that contribution was essentially a contribution of distraction. Even though he says the federal government have all these achievements—and there's the fact that they just rotate ministers in aged care—he spent at least seven minutes attacking the Labor Party.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Monday was the anniversary of this government's announcement of a royal commission into aged care. The anniversary is marked by the tragic fact that every part of Australia's aged-care system is in crisis. On Friday, the Morrison government extended the reporting date of the royal commission to November 2020. But we cannot wait. Action needs to be taken. Action needs to be taken now to fix what we know is broken today. But the Liberal government, the coalition government, doesn't even rate aged care as a priority. How do we know this? We know this because the Liberal government is on its fourth aged-care minister in six years. It is such a low priority that the aged-care minister is not considered important enough to be in cabinet, even though there's a royal commission on aged care happening right now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, we know the facts, as Senator Dean Smith likes to highlight, are that 129,000 Australians are waiting for approved home care packages and around 75,000 are waiting without any care at all. The waiting list has grown from 88,000 to 129,000 over the past 18 months alone. This is totally unacceptable. Equally unacceptable is the tragic fact that more than 16,000 people have died waiting for an approved package. The federal government, the coalition government, need to hang their heads in shame. Sixteen thousand people have died waiting. Fourteen thousand have had to enter residential aged care because they can no longer stay at home waiting for care packages, and many older Australians enter emergency departments or the hospital system due to their increasing care needs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the highest level of care, waiting times are now more than two years. Think about it. Think about your aged parents having to wait for the highest level of care for more than two years. That is what this government has presided over. Think about that. This government needs to be ashamed— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  I rise to contribute to this discussion and debate on the Liberals' record of inaction and cuts which over the last six years have led to Australia's broken aged-care system. We've had a series of coalition senators stand up in the chamber today, articulating some of the things that they have done, but the fact is we still have a system that is failing older Australians. We have heard about the terrible abuses that have been occurring in our aged-care system, through the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. The coalition are the ones who had to set up the royal commission because they haven't been able to fix the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a lot said about a number of issues, but one of the areas that I don't think have been getting much attention during this debate is clinical care—actually looking after older Australians who are in residential care. The Senate Community Affairs References Committee, at the very end of the last parliament, did an inquiry into the effectiveness of the aged-care quality assessment and accreditation framework for protecting residents from abuse and poor practices, and ensuring proper clinical and medical care standards are maintained and practised. The final report of that committee, which was not that long ago, found that there is one overarching failure which underpins the systemic flaws in aged-care services, and that is the lack of appropriate regulation of clinical care standards within residential aged-care facilities—and this is still the case. I was quite shocked during that inquiry to hear providers say that they aren't responsible for clinical care. Well, who is responsible for clinical care in our aged-care system? You would think that addressing this would be very high on the agenda. There are gaps in the current framework for the delivery of clinical services in aged-care facilities, and these, too, often result in poor clinical care for older Australians in aged care. That was one of the findings in our report. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry highlighted how much needs to be done to promote a higher quality of care for people living in aged-care facilities. We found that the sector needs person centred regulation to achieve person centred care. The lack of clear lines of responsibility around who has the ultimate duty of care towards residents remains a barrier to implementing the person centred care approach—that's what we found. We found that aged-care facilities ultimately hold a duty of care to all residents and are the last line of defence. Now, you'd think this would not be controversial, but apparently it is. If we haven't solved this issue, there's no way that the government can claim that residential care and aged care in this country is on track and all okey-dokey, because it simply isn't. If we are still having a debate about that and it can't be guaranteed, we are not hitting the mark.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommended that the government clarify that residential aged-care providers ultimately hold a duty of care to all residents. We should be supporting aged-care facilities and driving them to ensure that there is continuous quality improvement, which supports early intervention to manage problems before they become compliance issues. These are issues that absolutely need to be dealt with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been discussion today about home care places, where we still have such a massive waiting list. Yes, there were changes there, but what has been very clearly articulated is that we have a growing list of people waiting for care. We also have people who are receiving inadequate levels of care because the system, again, is not working. We have inadequate assessment processes. We have people who have been assessed for care that's at too low a level. We have people who have been assessed for care at a higher level but who aren't able to access services to deliver that higher level of care, at levels 3 and 4, so they're not using all of their packages. There's money that is not being used to provide care for those people. So at the same time that we have people who are not receiving the level of care they need—129,000 on the waiting list—we have people who aren't using all of their level 3 or 4 packages because they've determined that they don't actually need some of that care at the moment. The rumour going around is that people are assessed at a higher level because the assessors think it's going to take them a while to access that level. They're then on a higher level of care than they perhaps need. Or perhaps it's that they're saving money to use later, or they can't actually get the services they need, depending on where they are living. The point is that there's a whole lot of money that's been allocated that is not then being made available to help people who are on the waiting list and need care. It is absolutely clear that that needs urgent resolution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me come to the workforce. We know that we are not providing enough care for residents. We're averaging only around 2½ hours of care, when we need at least four hours and 18 minutes for proper provision of care support for people in aged care. We need the workforce to be able to provide that care. We need a workforce that has proper ratios, with staff appropriate to the needs of particular residents. We need to resolve that issue now. We need more funding, for a start, to be committed to aged care to support a larger workforce so that they're able to provide more hours of care to meet residents' needs. We need a vast injection of resources and funding for that, but also to make sure that we actually have the workforce there to provide that care. We are not doing enough in this country to ensure that we have people who are able to provide that level of care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues that I have been very passionate about in this place is mental health in aged care. I was very pleased when the government finally listened to calls for funding to be provided for residents in aged care so that they could access mental health services, because they weren't able to access the Better Access—sorry, I'm using the word 'access' a lot, but the fact is the program is called Better Access and residents in aged care were not able to access that particular program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding has been allocated—not enough—but what we're now finding is the provision of that mental health support is varying across the country. The funding has been given to the PHNs, and the PHNs, in their wisdom, have decided on multiple different approaches as to how that care is being provided. There are various trials being done; there are various ways providers can access those funds. I'm not at all—not at all!—reassured that every resident in an aged-care facility who needs to access mental health support and care is in fact able to access that care. I've spoken to people around this country and, as far as I can tell, from the conversations I've had, that service is not being adequately provided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to quickly touch on the fact that we have a massive service provider in this country, Bupa, that has not been meeting, in many of its facilities, the standard of care that we expect in this country, and this government has overseen that. I know the government are now meeting weekly with them, but this system has been in operation while the government have supposedly been doing all those other reports that the coalition senators have been talking about—'they've done this, this and this'. Well that has not stopped one of the major providers of residential care in this country from being unable to guarantee top quality care at every one of its facilities. We know there have been compliance issues and accreditation problems for a number of the facilities. That should not have been allowed to occur. If this system was working, we wouldn't have that situation in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government may have been doing some stuff, and I give them credit for doing that, but it's simply not enough. It is not enough, because we still have a failing aged-care system. We have people who are not able to access home care, we have people who are not receiving the standard of care we expect in this country and we have the very fact that they still can't make sure providers can guarantee they provide and are responsible for their duty of care for their residents and for providing clinical self-service. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I was about to say there were a few other things that you said that I didn't necessarily agree with, but the applause is much appreciated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, the Morrison coalition government, is delivering record investment across the aged-care system, and, in rising on this matter of public importance tonight, I would like to commend the efforts of the aged-care minister, Richard Colbeck, who is one of my colleagues from the great state of Tasmania. Senator Colbeck has been doing a fantastic job in his new role, and I'm sure many Tasmanians are very proud of him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as it is for Senator Colbeck, the aged-care sphere is an area close to my heart, as I'm sure it is for so many Australians as we anticipate or dwell upon ensuring that we have a robust system in place that will look after our parents and our grandparents—and even ourselves when the appropriate time comes. Certainly in my case, it is something that my family have had to contemplate in recent years, with my late grandmother going into an aged-care facility. That obviously opened my eyes to some of the opportunities for improvement that exist in this system, and this coalition government are certainly committed to seeking out those opportunities for improvement and increasing funding in these vital areas, because we know that more can be done to strengthen this system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's why, since this coalition government was elected back in 2013, aged-care spending has increased every single year. On average, we've added $1 billion of extra support for older Australians each year, and funding only continues to grow. In addition to this, the Morrison Liberal government is committed to improving aged care for all senior Australians, and that's why the Prime Minister called the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. Certainly in this chamber today we've heard a lot of commentary not just about this issue but about the family law committee that's been proposed as well, and it bothers me that a lot of the rhetoric has been caught up in rejecting further forms of inquiry because we might already know what the problems are. These are incredibly complex issues that are facing Australia, and I think it is only right we as a government should investigate them fully and should be able to understand the many nuanced issues that exist, particularly in family law. I was disappointed to hear that rhetoric regarding the committee today. This is why we've called the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety; it is so that we can in an appropriate forum uncover all of the issues that we have to deal with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast to Labor, quite frankly, couldn't be more stark. Labor at this election provided no additional funding in their costings for home care places or any additional funding for aged-care quality or workforce or for residential aged care. In contrast, our record in aged care, I believe, stands for itself. That's why older Australians resoundingly voted for the coalition government on 18 May and resoundingly returned this government, as Senator Scarr said in his contribution to this motion earlier this evening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is delivering record investment across the aged-care system over the forward estimates, from $13.3 billion in FY 2013 under Labor, growing to $21.7 billion in FY 2020 under a coalition government and to an estimated $25.4 billion in FY 2023. Our recent track record in improving aged care, including since the royal commission was called, is extensive, and my colleagues tonight have cited a number of different initiatives that we've introduced. I'm certainly not going to go through them all tonight, because our time is expiring, but I would like to assure the Senate and assure the Australian public that the Morrison coalition government takes this issue very seriously. That's why we've called a royal commission. That's why we're making record investment into the aged-care sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This report contains a credible technical examination of legislation with Australia's obligations under international human rights law, as required under the committee's statutory mandate. It sets out the committee's consideration of 16 bills introduced into the Parliament between 9 September and 12 September 2019, and seven legislative instruments registered on the Federal Register of Legislation between 2 August and 8 August 2019. The committee is seeking further information in relation to three bills and has also reiterated its previous comments in relation to two bills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to note that the committee has adopted a new approach to reporting on private members' and senators' bills. The committee has resolved that where such bills appear to engage and may limit human rights it will generally list those bills in the 'Advice Only' section of the report, but not substantively comment on them. But should the bills proceed to further stages of debate the committee may request further information from the legislation proponent as to the human rights compatibility of the bill. The current report provides an example of this approach. The National Integrity Commission Bill 2018 (No. 2) was introduced by a private senator, however, as the bill passed the Senate on 9 September 2019 and is now before the House, the committee is now seeking advice from the legislation proponent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee has also made concluding remarks in relation to five legislative instruments and two bills. Two of these instruments, the Australian Crime Commission Regulations 2018 and the Fisheries Management Regulations 2019, both allow for personal identifying information about persons suspected of crimes to be shared overseas. The committee has raised concerns in relation to both of these instruments about the lack of policy or guidelines in place to prevent such information being shared overseas where there is a risk that disclosing such information could expose a person to the death penalty or to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The committee has recommended that consideration be given to developing guidelines or legislative amendments to help ensure that information is not shared overseas in such circumstances. This is an issue the committee will continue to monitor.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  As Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I present the Delegated Legislation Monitor for 18 September 2019<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I was advised that—and I believe a similar pattern is established in regard to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee—on the records going back 30 years there has not been a divided vote on either of those committees. I just make that observation. There's been a very high level of bipartisanship operating on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, and I believe similarly on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the chair of the committee has previously noted in this parliament, this committee has resolved to take a stronger, more targeted approach to its work with a view to enhancing the parliamentary oversight and control of delegated legislation. This includes the use of disallowance processes to highlight and prosecute the committee's more significant scrutiny concerns. Consistent with this approach, on 1 August the chair of the committee acting on the committee's behalf gave notice of motion to disallow the Water Amendment (Murray-Darling Basin Agreement—Basin Salinity Management) Regulations 2018. The committee's decision to place the notice was based on serious and unresolved concerns that the instrument incorporated certain documents enforced from time to time without the legal authority to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to report that since the notice of motion to disallow was placed, the minister for water resources has advised the committee that he will seek to progress amendments to the Water Act to remove doubt about this issue. In light of the minister's undertaking, the committee has resolved to withdraw the notice of motion to disallow the instrument. The committee will continue to monitor the minister's undertaking to ensure that it's actually implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This matter highlights the effectiveness of the committee in promoting transparency and accountability in relation to delegated legislation. The committee thanks the minister and the department for the respect that they have shown the committee and for their willingness to engage constructively with the committee's scrutiny concern. The committee trusts that the satisfactory resolution of this matter will provide an example to other ministers and agencies to guide their engagement with the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to emphasise that the process by which the growing number of delegated legislative instruments have been used to avoid parliamentary scrutiny is a matter of deep concern and action is being taken to address this issue. I trust that this message is understood and received, and I repeat: this is a committee that operates on a bipartisan basis, and has done for 30 years, which the records identify—I'm sure it's much longer than that. With these comments, I commend the committee's Delegated Legislative Monitor No. 6 of 2019 to the Senate.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill expands the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation's functions to enable it to provide guarantees to improve access to home ownership, and undertake research into housing affordability, including supply and demand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It has become increasingly challenging for first home buyers to save a deposit to purchase their first home, despite their ability to service the loan, especially given historically low interest rates and relatively high housing price-to income ratios.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Based on median household income and a 15 per cent saving rate (on before tax income), it takes approximately eight years to save a 20 per cent deposit on a median priced home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why the Government is backing first home buyers through the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. The First Home Loan Deposit Scheme is designed to facilitate earlier access to home ownership for first home buyers, including those in rural and regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will provide direction on the operation of the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme and the research function component through an expansion of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation's Investment Mandate. The Investment Mandate will include details of the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, such as eligibility requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As announced by the Prime Minister during the election campaign, from 1 January 2020, eligible first home buyers will be able to enter the housing market sooner. Up to 10,000 guarantees per year will allow eligible first home buyers to purchase a home with a deposit of as little as 5 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Applicants will be subject to eligibility criteria, including taxable incomes up to $125,000 per annum for singles and up to $200,000 per annum for couples in the previous year, must be Australian citizens purchasing property in Australia and must be taking out owner-occupied loans on a principal and interest basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Properties purchased under the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme will be subject to regional price caps. Regional price caps will be set with a view to ensuring equitable access to the Scheme across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The coverage of the guarantee will be broadly consistent with parental guarantee products offered by some lenders. The guarantee will remain in place until a loan is refinanced or the outstanding loan balance falls below 80 per cent of the property purchase price - whichever comes first.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Access to the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme will occur as part of the normal home loan application process, with limited additional effort involved for first home buyers seeking a guaranteed loan</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to its role in administering the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation will take on a new research function to examine housing demand, supply and affordability in Australia. The National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation will establish close relationships with other research organisations to ensure its research efforts on housing affordability are focused where they are most needed and that they complement existing housing-related research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The First Home Loan Deposit Scheme and new research function are intended to complement other existing measures the Government has taken to reduce pressure on housing affordability including the First Home Super Saver Scheme, announced in 2017, which assists individuals to build a deposit for a first home inside their superannuation fund by making voluntary contributions. This is in addition to other measures the Government has implemented to improve housing affordability such as the City Deals, encouraging additional supply of dwellings. These measures combined with the First Home Loan Deposit's Scheme's role in reducing the hurdle involved in putting together a sufficient deposit without the need for Lenders Mortgage Insurance will go a long way to help make the dreams of first home buyers a reality sooner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  Before I was interrupted, I was talking about the tight timetable for making submissions to the proposed inquiry. Despite that timetable, 46 submissions were received, including submissions from industry superannuation funds, academics, regulators such as ASIC and APRA, and other interested parties. It is unfortunate that the government-chaired and government-controlled committee did not schedule public hearings to interrogate this written evidence. You would think, given the scope and scale of the changes to superannuation funds, which many millions of Australian workers rely upon for their retirement income, there would be proper scrutiny and a proper process, but that's not the government's purpose here. Instead, the committee resolved to report early, on 23 July. The urgency that apparently was there was not reflected in the government's subsequent actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the past three months, the bill has just sat there as the chamber has considered at length other pressing matters such as the government's Governor-General's address-in-reply, which has gone on now for some months. It is only now that we are debating this bill for the first time. It is unfortunate, because the intervening period could have been fruitfully used by the committee to more fully address the issues raised by stakeholders and for the government members of the committee maybe to learn a thing or two. Concerns about the implementation timetable were raised in the submission of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The deputy chair of APRA said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">APRA considers an appropriate implementation timeframe would be, at minimum, 6 months but preferably 12 months …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the Government proceeds with the proposed changes, the implementation date is unimplementable and will result in member confusion and detriment. It is proposed that the commencement date of 1 July 2020 would allow funds to renegotiate insurance contracts on reasonable terms, make relevant system changes and properly inform members, but under no circumstances should it be sooner than 6 months after royal assent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Super gave evidence of the impact of the previous reforms on their ability to communicate with members and to administer the changes. They said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… due to the short timeframe for removing cover for inactive members, the response from affected members was overwhelming and our expanded contact centre was unable to cope with the volume of calls …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst losing cover may provide significant benefits from not eroding account balances for the majority of members, a failure to make an informed decision to continue cover for members with financial commitments and dependents may have dire financial consequences for those unfortunate enough to die or become disabled.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That evidence was ignored, because of course the government's purpose here isn't to assist people; it is to disrupt the operation of the superannuation funds.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mine Super gave evidence about the difficulty of communicating with workers in remote areas and about FIFO workers being hard to reach. As a former board member of Mine Super, I can speak about the excellent work that they do, their very sound governance principles and the deep consideration that they give to the efficacy of the superannuation products that they offer to members.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the compressed timeframe for implementing the PYS changes caused confusion among consumers.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Group insurance is a means by which affordable and effective life, income protection, and total and permanent disability insurance can be provided bundled as part of a superannuation account. The bulk purchase of cover means that workers who would otherwise be unable to buy insurance because of cost or their high-risk occupation can gain the benefit of that insurance. Superannuation funds have provided this as a standard benefit. The Productivity Commission found that default insurance premiums significantly eroded the superannuation balance of low-income fund members. In extreme cases, this could amount to up to a quarter of the retirement balance. The Productivity Commission's findings also indicated that the default insurance offerings offered low value to some workers, particularly younger workers. The Productivity Commission acknowledged that the costs and claims ratio for most group insurance products was better than that in the general market. It also acknowledged that some workers would miss out on a benefit if that was not provided through their superannuation fund. That's quite a balanced set of conclusions, but, as I say, the government's not interested in taking account of these issues.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nearly 30 per cent of workers under 25 years or approximately 340,000 employees, are employed in occupations and industries that are inherently hazardous. Some industries are extraordinarily hazardous. In 2016, half (50%) of worker fatalities occurred within the Transport, postal and warehousing and Agriculture, forestry and fishing industries.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding those who are active low-balance members, Industry Super provided a table that showed that out of 633,159 active members, 25 per cent were in a high-risk job, 64 per cent were with a spouse and/or children and 23 per cent had a mortgage.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is determined to ensure that younger workers are protected from the erosion of their superannuation balance, but, at the same time, this must be balanced with ensuring that workers in those industries have cover they can afford or that they can access. Stripping police, construction workers, firefighters, transport workers and miners of their life insurance through superannuation, which may be the only life insurance they can access, is not a reasonable step. These workers and their families may be faced with devastating hardship if they are unable to access life insurance in the face of a calamity. Workers who put their lives on the line deserve to be able to access affordable insurance that will protect their loved ones in case of need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, this bill seeks to balance the interest of providing affordable, effective life insurance cover to employees, many of whom would be uninsurable, against the public interest in ensuring that member accounts are not eroded by insurance premiums. Labor supports these objectives, but we have concerns about unintended consequences for members in high-risk occupations, the implementation time frame of the bill and insurance premium increases and long-term impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate committee received 44 submissions. The opposition will move amendments to remedy the defects in the bill, including an amendment to extend the operative date to 1 July 2020 and to protect the benefits of workers in certain high-risk industries. Labor will always look to ensure that workers get a fair deal from their superannuation. The government has rushed through the bill without adequate time to consider these questions. Not a single public hearing has been held.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a reasonable balance to be struck here. We want to be able to support the objectives of the bill, but we want there to be a balanced, sensible approach to this set of reforms. On top of these issues, hardly a day goes by when a coalition MP doesn't come out with a new idea to trash the superannuation industry. We've heard from Senator Bragg, the leading light of the coalition backbench on these questions, saying he'd scrap the superannuation system for workers earning under $50,000 a year. This follows on from a gallery of coalition MPs—I think that's the collective noun we're using now—calling for a cut to the superannuation guarantee, including Craig Kelly, Andrew Hastie, Barnaby Joyce and Jason Falinski. None of these people will ever have to trouble themselves worrying about their retirement income, but they're most interested in trashing the retirement incomes of low-income workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one has the form, though, of the current minister, Senator Hume, when it comes to the coalition's war on industry super. For the minister, it's a holy war—what one may expect if you put a former big-four banker in charge of industry super. Industry superannuation funds, trade unions and Labor form an unholy trinity, the member wrote in a piece earlier this year—unsurprisingly, it was in the Oz—calling for the imposition of retail-fund-style governance on the industry sector. Incapable of conceiving how the system was built and the principles that drive the participants in the system, she regards that as an unholy trinity. It's a line that she's fond of. She also appears to believe that the primary problem in superannuation isn't the massive underperformance of retail super funds, like those at NAB, or the gouging and rip-offs perpetrated by the big banks, AMP or others on retail fund members; it is what she believes are industry super funds' inherent conflicts of interest. She can't drag herself away from that question to deal with the big performance issues in the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, for Senator Hume the very birth of compulsory super in Australia was evil. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There was an unholy accord, for want of a better expression, between Bill Kelty and Paul Keating back in about 1991 when they decided to introduce compulsory superannuation, rather than a pay rise, for the unionised workforces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was not an unholy accord. It was the result of struggle and work to build a retirement income system that members opposite would have found impossible to conceive. The only interest they've got now in the system is to wreck it. Actually, compulsory super was introduced in the 1985 accord, but let's not sweat the small stuff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compulsory superannuation was, as Senator Hume said, very hard for employers. Indeed, she insisted that the compulsory superannuation system put a lot of people out of work. To be fair to her, she is yet to go as far as Senator Bragg and others calling for the abolition of the system for some classes of workers. In 2017, in a speech in which Senator Hume claimed that compulsory superannuation had been introduced during the death throes of the Labor government—we thought 1985 was a pretty good year—she argued that the existing industry super governance model, which has delivered returns for members far greater than retail super, was 'entirely irrelevant'; it was 'a legacy of the past'; it suffered from an 'uncritical groupthink mentality'. This is the approach that drives the heart of the coalition's approach to industry super. It's an approach that the community should reject. I think that the Senate, by adopting the Labor amendments, should send the government a message: hands off industry super.</span>

                    <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  While the Labor Party is supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Members' Interests First) Bill 2019 because it has some good objectives, I very much sign up to the chorus of concern from Labor senators, who have expressed their deep concern about the failure of the government to engage with the Labor Party on addressing some of the key problems in this legislation, including, as my colleague Senator Ayres has pointed out and as Senator McAllister pointed out in her speech on the second reading, the issues to do with workers who are in high-risk industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the substance of this bill arose out of the Productivity Commission's concern about the number of Australians with multiple superannuation accounts, as well as the concerns about the fact that insurance premiums have been eating into the balances of workers in low-wage industries. I myself should have been more aware of the fact that I paid insurance out of two superannuation accounts—accounts that I was happy with. I paid insurance out of two accounts for some 10 years. I dread to think what the impact of that was on my superannuation balance; I probably don't want to look too hard at that. I have since remedied that situation. So I do understand that the government needs to take action to improve superannuation and these superannuation policies to ensure that they fit people's needs in terms of their point in life—if you're a young worker and you're not as likely to be facing periods of illness in your life or have a greater call for insurance. I understand that it is in Australians' interests for us to tweak these policies and the legislation framework around it. However, I do not believe that the government has done its best due diligence in that regard. We have Australians who work in very high-risk industries where this is likely to be the only insurance product that they can afford. We would have really liked to have seen the government pay more attention to those issues, but it's very clear that they've failed to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the opportunity, in the form of a Senate inquiry, to take the time to address those issues, but I can see from the Senate's records that the committee that dealt with this legislation reported early and didn't hold public hearings on the matter to interrogate this written evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    </a>  You didn't look very hard!</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator PRATT:</span>
                    </a>  I'm happy to take the interjection if I'm incorrect on that matter. It is the responsibility of this chamber to hear the concerns of Australians about the legislation that is before us in this place. A long reporting time frame should have given the committee time to engage with these issues and address the concerns of people in high-risk industries. The committee received some 46 submissions from super funds, academics, regulators and other interested parties, but we didn't get to hear and interrogate that evidence before a Senate committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that context, Labor was calling for a longer time frame of implementation on this legislation, out to 2020, the government sought to push ahead with an implementation date of 1 October—some two weeks away. I understand the government is moving amendments in this regard, however, it really does underscore the point that it hasn't taken the time to address the technical issues in this legislation that this place, and the committee, should have had the opportunity to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Super funds have expressed to the parliament and the committee their concern about implementing this legislation in such a short time frame, and the regulators also have expressed that concern. Yet here we are, with a start date of 1 October in the draft of this legislation. I'm not across the detail of the amendments that the government might seek to move, but I would want very clear assurances that the new timetable as you amend it—or that I hope you amend—has been worked through with regulators and the industry to make sure that it is something that is objectively achievable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that of the other concerns in relation to this legislation, meeting the existing proposed time line looks to result in significant pricing revisions, and that that doesn't flow through automatically. That will see super funds needing to renegotiate the group insurance contracts with their insurers. I would like to know how those issues will be addressed, in the context of the minister responding on this legislation in the second reading response. We want to see how the renegotiation of contracts is going to fare in the context of the time line for the implementation of these legislative changes. That is why Labor senators have been pushing that the commencement of this bill not be until next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to return to one of the issues I've already touched on, and that is the concern for members of these super funds who are in high-risk occupations. These issues were at the forefront of submissions made to the inquiry, and they haven't been adequately addressed. We sought to make amendments in the other place on these issues, and we will need to pursue them here, because the government has not adequately responded to the situation that current holders of these insurance policies may find themselves in when they are suddenly without these insurance policies to protect them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, the ideal situation for Australian workers is that everyone comes home safe and sound from a day's work. Then we wouldn't need these life insurance policies, which are, in large part, to cover us for workplace injuries or accidents. I want to highlight to this place the fundamental importance that unions play in campaigning and ensuring that superannuation is fit for purpose and the excellent role that industry super funds have played in supporting workers in Australia. But hand in hand with that is coming home safe from work every day. Sadly, this is not the case for all Australian workers. These insurance products, embedded in superannuation, are incredibly important for all workers, but specifically, and in particular, for those in high-risk industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the ACTU's evidence, between 2003 and 2016 a staggering 3,400 workers lost their lives on the job. Of those, close to 10 per cent were under the age of 25. It's all very well to assume that when a young worker loses their life they don't need an insurance product because they don't have dependents and they don't have things that need covering, but you cannot ever assume that's the case. Young workers do have families, they do have mortgages, they do get cancer, they do get sick, and you can't assume that they're not going to need to call on that insurance product to support themselves or to support their families. So for those who work in high-risk occupations, we need to consider their issues substantively in this place, and I do not believe that the government has adequately done that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope very much that you have a very real response to the amendments that the Labor Party will seek to move in this place. The bill, as drafted, currently cancels insurance for police officers, paramedics, construction workers, truck drivers, agricultural workers, forestry workers, prison officers and healthcare workers, all of whom are at high risk of suffering a workplace injury or, tragically, death. More than 27 per cent of workers under the age of 25 are, in fact, in high-risk occupations such as these, and it's very clear that insurance has real value for them and for their families. It is, frankly, nonsense to suggest to young workers that they should seek individual cover for themselves rather than rely on the default cover provided by their super fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at, for example, the intersection of this legislation with the fair work bills that are also currently before this place, one of them being the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2019. The funds that currently enable redundancy payments, which is where employers collect funds on behalf of employees and put them into these redundancy funds, also help protect workers in these high-risk occupations. They're high risk not only in a safety sense but also in a phoenixing sense—the coming and going of industries that go broke and then recreate themselves. In this situation, young workers will reply on their insurance product while they're working and also rely on redundancy products to make sure their entitlements are paid out as they peak and trough from contract to contract. What I'm concerned about here is that you are abandoning the needs of these workers not only in this legislation but also in the proper use of worker benefits legislation. The viability of redundancy funds and of access to reasonably priced and accessible insurance products are incredibly important for this cohort of workers. And, frankly, I think it is ridiculous to expect young people who have plenty of other issues on their minds, who are hopefully saving up for a mortgage, who are just making their way in the insecure world of work—because many of them are also in insecure work—to truly think about having their own insurance product. You can't really choose an insurance product if your work is insecure, and the insurance in your superannuation may be the only insurance product, other than your car insurance, that you really think about having.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, Mine Super are a fund where 90 per cent of their members are employed in high-risk occupations. They've raised concerns where they say that these occupations are often ineligible for retail insurance coverage and are uninsurable outside the group insurance offering within the superannuation environment. So surely there's an argument for the government to have addressed whether there are some super funds where it is relevant to opt out from insurance being removed from their products on an arbitrary basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I want to address in this context is the importance of group insurance in keeping insurance premiums down. In the second reading response, you might also address for us the issues that are around the way insurance premiums are derived, particularly if people in high-risk industries are suddenly left needing to purchase their own insurance products because they don't get the bonus, if you like, of being in pooled superannuation funds where you can really drive down the price of insurance—where you've got people in lower-risk industries cross-subsidising the insurance for people in higher-risk industries. That's because, if these people in high-risk industries are truly uninsurable or if the insurance is truly unaffordable, there are deeper questions, really, about the fact that we should be having insurance products, and we really need to look at it in a policy context of how we address life insurance questions for people who do face a higher level of risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mine Super have said that they receive about 800 claims per year, which is approximately one in every 50 insured members making a claim in any given year. Frankly, it seems pretty ridiculous that you would have an arbitrary opt-out in those circumstances, because there's a reasonable likelihood that even young workers will need to draw on that insurance product, and the cross-insurance that they gain, even if they are low-paid workers, is worth investing in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACTU touched on the issues that I was raising before in relation to what happens to insurance premiums—how they sort themselves out when you start opting out high-risk occupations or opting out younger people. They've raised concerns about insurance premiums spiking for those who prudently opt in, as well as for existing members within the group insurance plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's listened very carefully to stakeholders that have raised these concerns. We've moved amendments in the other place to protect workers in high-risk occupations, and I look forward to those issues being vigorously pursued in this place in the committee stage. It is a shame to me that the government was unwilling to support amendments in the other place. We do need to have a strong committee stage on this bill to make sure that these issues are addressed. I also want to highlight the fact that there's a key gender dimension to this legislation, and the government do not appear to have given proper scrutiny to those issues either. I don't think that's any surprise, given the rough, rushed process that they have been in in implementing this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing: whilst there are very important elements to this legislation that I certainly see will benefit many workers in protecting the balance of their superannuation product— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures were actually introduced in the 2018-19 budget, 16 months ago, and not only that, but the measures contained in this bill have been to a previous inquiry. I say this for your benefit, Senator Ciccone, because I don't want you to get up and repeat the same errors that your colleagues have just made. These identical measures were considered in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill, which was looked at by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee last year, including—surprise, surprise—at a public hearing. Who did we hear from at that public hearing? We heard from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, CHOICE, the Financial Rights Legal Centre, corporate super association Rice Warner, ClearView Wealth, the Financial Services Council—who's this one?—the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia and the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees. So not only have these measures been around for 16 months; they have been considered before by the Senate economics committee, which is the reason that I and my fellow members of the committee decided that an inquiry off the papers was appropriate in these circumstances. Because the Senate economics committee takes its role very seriously, one of the things that I quizzed the secretariat about is whether the provisions in this bill were identical to the provisions considered in the previous inquiry, and the answer was: yes, they were. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will let the minister respond to some of the other falsehoods we've been hearing from those opposite, who were talking about people being stripped of their insurance and about hazardous occupations not being adequately covered in this bill. Senator Ayres was quoting AustralianSuper data in his arguments when AustralianSuper, of its own volition, was one of the first superannuation funds to move to this system for under-25s. Yet he is quoting AustralianSuper data. So I just want to put on the record that the Senate economics committee did look at this bill. We looked at it in detail. We made two recommendations, which have been considered by the government, and I thank the minister for doing so. I certainly commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281503" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Members' Interests First) Bill 2019. The stated purpose of this bill is to prevent insurance premiums from eroding superannuation balances of members of our community. In particular, it is targeted towards younger Australians and those who already have low superannuation balances. As stated in this chamber earlier today, Labor is supportive of the aim of the bill. However, as mentioned in the report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, Labor believes that, in its current form, the bill runs a very serious risk of producing a number of unintended consequences once it is put into effect. In doing so, the bill jeopardises the attainment of its own stated objective if passed through this place without any serious amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to take this opportunity to put on the record a range of concerns that I myself have with this bill, because, indeed, there are significant areas of concern that must be properly considered by members of this place as we debate this proposed piece of legislation. At the heart of our role as a Senate is our own responsibility to protect the interests of our constituents and to ensure they all have the tools and resources that they need to live their lives in a prosperous manner. Insurance to cover yourself and your family to make sure you can continue to keep a roof over your head and food on the table, just in case the worst happens, is absolutely essential for workers, particularly those in high-risk industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The insurances we are discussing today, whether they be life insurance, total permanent disability insurance or income protection insurance, need to be easily understood and applied properly and ethically to ensure that coverage and protection can be accessed by every person in our community, whether they need it or not. To be clear, protecting workers from erosion of their superannuation balances is a reasonable goal. I, along with every member of the Labor benches, am committed to helping workers save for a secure retirement. However, I also want to make sure that every member of our community has access to the kind of insurance that will help give them the peace of mind that they and their loved ones will be covered should something go wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In discussing the shortfalls of this bill and potential amendments for its improvement, Labor firmly believes that this bill should exclude workers in occupations that have a high risk of accident and injury. What we're talking about here are workers in construction; transport; agriculture and forestry; nurses; prison workers; paramedics; and police officers, just to name a few. It is absolutely in the best interests of these workers that they have the protection they need and the peace of mind that they and their families deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Australian Council of Trade Unions, around a quarter of workers aged under 25 are employed in these high-risk occupations. Of deep concern to a range of stakeholders is something that should be top of every senator's mind as we consider this bill and which was highlighted by Mine Super in a submission to the Senate inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">• members in these high-risk occupations are often ineligible for retail insurance coverage and are uninsurable outside of group insurance offerings; …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">within the superannuation environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm hugely reluctant to leave workers in high-risk occupations in the situation where they and their loved ones are unable to be covered by life insurance, total and permanent disability insurance or income protection insurance, given the greater risk they face. The timing of this legislation is also cause for concern and something that Labor believes must be changed. The start date is listed as 1 October, which is less than two weeks away. This will place an extraordinary administrative burden on superannuation funds. Representatives from funds that I have spoken with recently have reported to me about the onerous increases in workload following the most recent round of superannuation insurance changes, which commenced earlier this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Super also gave evidence to this effect to the inquiry into the bill, telling senators:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…the response from affected members was overwhelming and our expanded contact centre was unable to cope with the volume of calls and provide what we would consider an acceptable service to affected members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Representatives from Australian Super described the start date as implementable and that this bill would further increase workloads on funds as they notify members, answer member inquiries and ensure that the best interests and the needs of their members are met. It is completely unrealistic to expect that the nation's 500 or so superannuation funds will be able to notify their millions of members and implement a complex series of insurance changes between today and 1 October. In fact, APRA gave evidence to the Senate inquiry into this bill, telling the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Requiring superannuation funds to implement the changes in the required timeframe will pose significant challenges for industry, particularly given the extent and complexity of the changes that will need to be undertaken …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">APRA's submission continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is critical that the PMIF Bill provides for appropriately targeted transitional arrangements that provide superannuation funds with sufficient time to take the necessary steps to implement the reforms in a manner that minimises any unintended consequences, particularly for members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be deeply wrong for us in this place to push through a series of changes that would impact fund members before they had the time to make an informed choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very worried that the government is moving to make insurance harder, not easier, to access for people with accounts where there is a balance of less than $6,000. This was not included in the recommendations of the Productivity Commission report, which has been the impetus for this proposed legislation, and there has not been a compelling explanation from the government or the minister for this measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also concerned that there has not been careful enough consideration given to the range of reasons why a person may have an inactive superannuation account. A number of stakeholders have raised significant concerns about the adverse impacts of this proposal on a range of account holders well beyond just young workers. The people who fall into this cohort do not often have large amounts of cash at hand, should the worst happen. Rice Warner warned the Senate inquiry into the bill that there would likely be adverse impacts on parents returning to work after the birth of a baby; on those who work part-time, an ever-increasing proportion of the workforce; on new migrants; on those with very little or very low salaries; and on anyone who simply opens a new superannuation account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cancer Council and CanTeen wrote to me last month expressing some very serious concerns about what this legislation will do to young people who are diagnosed with cancer. For the 1,000 young people aged between 15 and 25 years who are diagnosed with cancer each year, the TPD insurance associated with their superannuation may be the only financial support open to them. Further, the letter also said that this was obviously particularly important as we recognise the growing financial toxicity of having cancer. I know a number of senators have raised a range of issues regarding people's stages of life and the importance of having that cover.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another submission that was made to the inquiry was from the SDA, my former union. The SDA told senators at the inquiry into this bill:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By denying these workers default group insurance, when things go wrong, they will be likely to have to rely on the health and social welfare system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former official of the SDA, I know from working there that a majority of our members are low-income earners. These are people who are earning somewhere around $30,000 to $40,000 a year. Having superannuation that has insurance as part of a collective means that they can afford to have cheap and effective insurance through REST accounts. SDA members mostly contribute their superannuation to REST, and most of them fall within the cohort that's defined in the bill. In 2018, 62 per cent of members of REST were women, and 35 per cent were under the age of 25. While the average account balance is around $26,000, almost half—around 924,000—have balances under $6,000. At the time, the SDA also made mention in the inquiry that more than 880,000 of its members would lose their cover. A year on, many more will be affected. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Insurance is a means of protection, be it financial protection or reimbursement against losses. Superannuation makes sure that those who can't afford insurance in the private sector can get something that is cheap and affordable for them and their families. It allows the risk to be shared amongst those who use it and those who don't. That's what insurance is. But insurance in the superannuation context is designed to assist and support workers who experience unexpected health and wellbeing challenges. The other comparison that can be made—and I think this was part of some other contributions earlier today—is to Medicare. We all chip in, whether we use the health care system or not, but what it does is ensure that all Australians have the ability to access cheap and affordable health care in this country, something we should be very proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As superannuation is an industrial right of workers, it is the most cost-effective method of providing insurance cover for death, total and permanent disability, and income protection. One point nine million Australians are members of REST, and group insurance provides benefits that others just don't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With a government who refuses to increase Newstart, who isn't afraid to push people off the disability support pension, who is known for deep cuts to Medicare and to health and hospital funding, you do have to wonder why it would seek to move costs for the care of people, when things go wrong, from their insurance provider to the public purse. That strikes me as a bizarre thing for the coalition government to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are people who have less than $6,000 in their superannuation account who, sadly, will have an accident at home on a weekend—people who will fall off the ladder trying to clear out the gutters—who won't be covered by WorkCover, who won't be covered by public liability insurance, who won't be covered for TSC in my home state of Victoria, and who will find themselves without income protection or TPD insurance through their superannuation, because of this bill. What will happen to these people and their families?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the unintended consequences of this bill will very likely be upward pressure on premium prices for members who remain covered by the life, TPD and income protection insurance in their superannuation accounts. We are already seeing that now with private health insurance in Australia. As the SDA union submitted to the inquiry on this bill, it is also likely that there will be an increase in premiums across the board as numbers decline. Meanwhile, for the under 25s and the holders of accounts with less than $6,000 who do decide to opt in, their premiums could well be far more expensive than they are currently.

We will never stand by and watch workers' rights be ground away, unlike those opposite. We will never stop fighting to make sure that every person who works gets a fair day's pay and is looked after and protected under strong workplace relations laws. And we'll always fight to make sure that workers get the best from their superannuation.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:13</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Members' Interests First) Bill 2019. This bill seeks to amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999, allegedly to improve the default insurance arrangements for superannuation. By now, we're all aware of what this bill aims to do. I say 'aims to do' because, as we all know in this place, an aim is not necessarily the same as a result. The bill aims to protect the superannuation savings of younger members and members with low-balance funds from being eroded by insurance premiums. The bill aims to try to achieve this protection by taking away the default life insurance options for these accounts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst supporting the aim of the bill, the realities are quite different. As was also raised before, this bill has had previous discussion but it requires more discussion. It requires more consideration by the Senate. The bill requires some amendments so that there are no unintended consequences. When this bill was introduced in the Senate in early July, stakeholders were clear that there was some problematic issues and potential unintended consequences in this legislation. But instead of letting the Senate inquiry give further consideration to the issues properly and holding to the original October reporting time, the government, regardless, has shrunk the time frame for submissions and consideration, and there was an unseemly rush to get submissions in by 15 July. That left just 11 days after the bill was referred. This is an incredibly tight time frame on a matter that needs to be properly reconsidered for submitters to compile the further evidence and data that are needed for further consideration of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this incredibly short time frame, 46 submissions were received. We had submissions from the broad range of stakeholders like regulators, super funds and academics. Regardless of previous consideration, they said the government chaired and government controlled committee did not schedule a single public hearing to ask questions and examine these submissions, because there needed to be further consideration beyond the consideration that had already been given.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Superannuation affects every Australian. Why the unseemly rush? Why the lack of more appropriate public scrutiny? My friends on the other side might say, 'We had a meeting here and a meeting there,' but it requires more public engagement. It requires people to actually be very clear about the consequences and be able to submit their views on the effect of this bill. Despite this whole process being rushed to a conclusion by 23 July, the government has done nothing for months. It's now September and we're finally debating the bill. We could have used this time more genuinely for further consideration, further examination and further reflection, and really allowed the Senate committee to do further work to grapple with the issues raised by all the stakeholders who contributed to this exercise in good faith. And now here in mid-September the government is back in rush mode. Say that to someone who doesn't have insurance, because not only will this impact on somebody under the age of 25 but it will impact on the entire family. The financial burden goes across families and communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government wanted the bill to be operative from 1 October. Funds need to be able to properly inform members of their funds of the consequences of this bill. We note that these deadlines are totally unreasonable. They were unreasonable when they were introduced in July, let alone September. Concerns about the implementation timetable were raised in submissions from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. APRA, in its submission, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">APRA considers an appropriate implementation time frame would be at a minimum six months, but preferably 12 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry Super Australia also offered their own evidence of the impact on industry super funds of these compressed timelines. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the Government proceeds with the proposed changes, the implementation date is unimplementable and will result in member confusion and detriment. It is proposed that the commencement date of 1 July 2020 would allow funds to renegotiate insurance contracts on reasonable terms, make relevant system changes and properly inform members, but under no circumstances should it be sooner than 6 months after royal assent.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="256063" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  I rise tonight to speak about a very important national matter: the inability of the opposition to seriously and credibly engage in the economic policy debate in this country, especially in respect of superannuation. I want to give you a few examples, Acting Deputy President.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, during the last election campaign, one of Labor's signature policies was the retiree tax, which was conceived by their friends at Industry Super Australia. It was announced in March 2018, and it was such a ham-fisted policy design that it had to be redesigned and sent out again for circulation just two weeks later. This was a policy that was going to hit almost a million self-funded retirees and a number of retirees who were taking a pension and no other form of income. Even in the first iteration of this policy Industry Super Australia said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Super funds where most Australians have their retirement savings will be largely unaffected by this proposal because the imputation credits are exhausted offsetting tax liabilities of the fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Translation: Labor have a policy which we've designed called the retiree tax, which won't affect us but will hit a lot of other people who were in self-managed super funds and the like. This sort of infection of Labor's policy development process meant that they took to the election this policy which was unfair and retrospective. It would have pulled the rug out from under almost a million Australians. It demonstrated the strength of the internal advocacy and lobbying of a particular interest group to carve out this policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, we spent a chunk of today talking about insurance reforms. It really is pathetic to hear Labor run all the insurance company lines—absolutely pathetic. The Productivity Commission has said that almost $2 billion each and every year is being drained from people's retirement savings for unnecessary insurance. The Grattan Institute, CHOICE—all the honest brokers, effectively—have said that this reform of our government being led by the Assistant Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and Financial Technology, Senator Hume, is a good thing. Labor say it's bad and it's no good; they're just running lines from the insurance companies. They're crying tears for the insurance companies—I really do feel for them! We heard the SDA lines just before from the REST fund, which has spent a lot of resources trying to oppose these changes. We're in the business of backing workers, not vested interests. We put forward policies which will advance our nation's interests and advance the interests of workers, not any particular interest group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That takes me to the third example, again in the superannuation space, of a principal recommendation of the Hayne royal commission, which was that workers should only have one default fund across their lifetime. We have accepted this recommendation, but the Labor Party, again, have struggled to support this. They said before the election that Industry Super Australia—again—who put forward an alternative way this could be done, would support that. Across the board you see a Labor Party totally bereft of any internal policy development capability, whether it's disastrous policies like the retiree tax, where the former shadow Treasurer encouraged people not to vote for the Labor Party, or more contemporaneous issues, as we've been debating today in the Senate, on improving the superannuation scheme for workers. Labor will only run the lines and the arguments which are given to them on a platter by the unions and parts of the financial services sector. I really do worry about the future of policy contests here in the Australian parliament if Labor can only run the lines of vested interests.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:24</span>):  I rise tonight to speak about the wages crisis in Australia today—a crisis of low and persistently stagnant wages. This crisis is having a devastating impact on people across the country. The Prime Minister loves to use the phrase, 'If you have a go, you get a go,' but millions of Australians around the country are struggling, and they're struggling despite working hard and despite having a go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wage growth has absolutely tanked since this government came into power in 2013. For five years in a row, wage growth has been at record lows. These abysmal numbers have real-life consequences for real-life people. Take Kylie, a qualified early-childhood educator. She works full time, she's studying for her diploma and she's looking after her three beautiful children as a single mother. But Kylie is worried about her family's future. Her pay increases have been so small over the past few years that she can't see how she'll ever be able to save any of her income, let alone put enough down for a deposit on a house.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And take Olissa, a cleaner. Her wages have also been static for years. She struggles to look after her husband, who's on a disability pension and unable to work. She struggles to support her kids and pay the bills. Olissa's daughter was accepted into Victoria University to study, but after just one year she had to quit her studies in order to help support the family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not isolated stories. There are millions of Australians and their families in similar situations, struggling to pay the bills and struggling to support their families. The fact is Kylie, Olissa and many other Australians need to see their wages moving again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's flat wages are now part of a larger crisis around the cost of living. The bare bones essentials that families need—electricity, child care, housing, health care, education and transport—keep going up and up and up. Australian families have been put in a pressure cooker by this government. Everything is going up, except their wages. Household debt is at record highs, and the pressure on families just keeps growing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for the government to take action and get wages moving. The wages crisis is impacting hardworking Australians and also impacting our whole economy, because without wage increases Australians have less money to spend in their local communities, and their daily consumption is a huge factor in determining economic growth, investment and job creation. The government know this, but they are doing nothing to relieve the pressure on household budgets or boost wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you how, instead, they've spent the first few months of this new parliament: attacking workers' rights to organise, telling pensioners that their pension is 'generous', cooking up a plan to roll out the awful robodebt scheme to even more vulnerable Australians, scapegoating people on social security payments, plotting whose penalty rates they're going to allow to be cut next, making up excuses about why the economy is faring so badly and gloating about the election. Well, the election is over. It's time to stop talking and start working for the people that we represent. It's time to stop trying to make Australia look over there at anything but the government's inaction on wages and the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So here's the message for this government: millions of Australians need you to come up with a plan now, because they're struggling. Kylie and Olissa want to know how you're going to work for them and address the challenges they're facing, because they've heard nothing. They need to see a plan to get the economy moving again, they need to see a plan to address the spiralling cost of living, they need to see a plan to get wages going up and, most of all, they need this government to start doing its job.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  Tonight I call on the publication which calls itself The Conversation to live up to its name. Yesterday, its daily newsletter arrogantly determined to stop conversation. The lack of self-awareness is as cringe-worthy as it is acute. The Conversation stopping conversation on the topic of—you've guessed it!—climate change is to deny its banner and its very reason for existence. Why, you may ask, would The Conversation deny its own name? The answer, colleagues, is in the heading of the newsletter, 'Climate change deniers are dangerous—they don't deserve a place on our site'. Allow me to give you a few quotes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Once upon a time, we might have viewed climate sceptics as merely frustrating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it's 2019, and … we know better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That's why … a zero-tolerance approach to moderating climate change deniers, and sceptics. Not only will we be removing their comments, we'll be locking their accounts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">Dob them in and help us create a space where they don't derail the conversation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong couldn't have put it better themselves. They'd be so proud!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an agnostic in the climate change debate, I accept that there are scientists of good faith on all sides. I'm willing to listen, to try to discern and determine where the facts actually lie. To so superciliously and arrogantly deny a voice to an alternative point of view is reminiscent of totalitarian regimes. The orthodoxy, it seems, shall prevail not through rational debate, scientific endeavour and reasoning, but by crushing, shunning and banning any opposing views. But it is through challenging, questioning, probing, asking and debating that we learn, discover and innovate. Inquiring minds look beyond orthodoxies, independently assessing issues. It's what has got us to where we are today. We can learn more, will learn more and, indeed, need to learn more, but only if we don't stifle the inquiring mind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For well over half a century we've been subjected to environmental prophets of doom who've proven to be false. Prophecies have told us the USA would be on food rations and water rations by 1980. We've been told the Brisbane River wouldn't flood again. Since that prophecy, it's happened not once, but twice. We've been told the Murray River wouldn't flow out to sea again. Since that prophecy, it has. And the list goes on, including the death, Senator Dean Smith, of the city of Perth. Well, last time I looked I think it still existed! So please forgive our fellow Australians who are willing to ask the questions. When the United Nations have, for more than 30 years, predicted we only have 10 years left to fix climate change, we're entitled to ask why their predictions have been wrong. Given the undisputed legacy of unfulfilled predictions, people are entitled to question and to put an alternative viewpoint.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This ugly, unscientific, totalitarian, arrogant approach taken by The Conversation is the exact opposite to the principles of scientific endeavour. The lesson of history is the truth will out and the inquiring mind will ultimately prevail. The Conversation can stop the conversation, but it cannot stop the march of inquiring minds that will ultimately determine this issue. The taxpayers, who indirectly fund this publication, deserve so much better. The Conversation needs to live up to its name.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  Last week, the Tasmanian Liberal government had an opportunity in state parliament to show that they are serious about addressing family violence. Instead, the 12 Liberal members of the house of assembly, other than the Speaker, voted down a Labor motion calling on the government to properly fund Tasmania's Family Violence Counselling and Support Service. This service was established as part of the Safe at Home initiative and offers professional, specialised services to assist children, young people and adults affected by family violence. It delivers a whole host of services, including information, counselling and support, arranging assistance from police, organising safe accommodation, referrals to court support and legal aid, and acting as an advocate in speaking to other agencies such as Housing Connect or Centrelink. I cannot stress enough the importance of a service like this, nor praise highly enough the work of their staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When a person leaves a violent relationship they can be extremely vulnerable. Victims will often leave with few belongings, no accommodation and no financial resources, while their abuser has often successfully isolated them from their friends, family and support networks. Without a service such as this, where can they go? Who do they turn to? The service currently receives sufficient funding to handle 2,000 referrals a year, yet this is not coming close to keeping up with current demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, there were just over 6,000 referrals to the Family Violence Counselling and Support Service. This has placed the staff at the service under enormous stress. No-one in need of help gets turned away, but with only one-third of the resources needed to meet demand it is impossible to give every person referred the support and the help they need. You can no doubt imagine that this is extremely distressing for the staff, let alone the people who are desperately seeking their help. The service estimates that they need a further 11.54 full-time equivalent staff to meet the additional demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A month ago, Premier Will Hodgman offered to meet the staff, but he is yet to honour that commitment. There was a great demonstration of the overwhelming community sentiment about this issue when, on Friday night, Mr Hodgman posted on Facebook about an Our Watch/Engender Equality forum. The post, in which Mr Hodgman celebrated 'putting the prevention of violence against women into practice', was inundated with comments about funding for the Family Violence Counselling and Support Service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are a few examples of those comments. The first reads, 'Family violence support and counselling services need to be adequately funded and resourced by the government. It's the only way to break the cycle of violence. Take some positive action please, to get funding to these much-needed services.' Another quote reads, 'We need this government to provide support to victims of family violence in addition to preventive measures. You can't just forget about those that are already suffering because you are hoping to reduce family violence in the future. Please ensure the Family Violence Counselling and Support Service continues to be funded to those in need now.' And there's this one: 'Please, if you value and are committed to eliminating family violence, you must support the victims to ensure that they can access the services which potentially could be the only way they can see their way out or know that they're not alone.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as calling on the Tasmanian government to meet the staffing shortfall, the Labor opposition is seeking assurances that the government's review of family violence services won't result in the restructuring, dismantling or outsourcing of FVCSS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank those who have advocated for the service, including the Tasmanian Labor opposition—in particular their family violence spokesperson, Michelle O'Byrne—and the Community and Public Sector Union. Unlike the Hodgman government, they are standing up for the FVCSS, its staff and the thousands of victims of family violence it seeks to support. Premier Will Hodgman may well be a White Ribbon ambassador, but it takes more than wearing a white ribbon to show you're serious about tackling family violence. Mr Hodgman and his government are failing Tasmanian victims of family violence. If the Tasmanian government want to show that they are serious about family violence, they need to recognise that the FVCSS is an integral part of the Safe at Home framework. Furthermore, they must properly fund the service to meet demand. Failing to do so leaves victims of family violence isolated and vulnerable, with little choice but to return to the violent, abusive relationships that they sought to escape, and that's just not acceptable.</span>
