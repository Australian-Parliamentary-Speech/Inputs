         —In the absence of my colleague the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the shadow Minister, who at this moment is preparing to leave with a delegation to the United States, I wish to make a few comments. Firstly, I thank the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) for deferring the legislation when it was last before this place. The tabling of two pages of amendments I believe did offend the forms of this House. The Opposition parties had little time to peruse and assess those amendments; of course, it was necessary for us to discuss the amendments with representatives of the industry.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the time that has elapsed we have had the opportunity to consult with the leadership of the Australian dried fruits industry, a major part of which is in my electorate of Mallee. Following this consultation the Opposition is satisfied that the amendments before the Committee are both satisfactory in a technical sense and are sensible in overcoming some of the shoddy drafting that existed in the legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no purpose in delaying the Committee because there was considerable debate on the legislation during the last sitting. Briefly, the history of the Australian dried fruits industry is one of success and stability in marketing and discipline in quality control. This has been brought about particularly by the mature leadership the industry has had over the past 100 years. The Opposition is disappointed that this specialist industry, which produces a unique Australian product, is being forced by the Government to become part of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. In addition, it is being charged some $60,000 a year for what is a very dubious pleasure.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Horticultural Corporation may have an important role in drawing together a diversity of horticultural industries that lack the necessary skills, marketing structure and professionalism to meet the demands of world trading. But the Australian dried fruits industry does not have that problem. It is a specialist industry that has been extremely successful in marketing in a very difficult climate. The Opposition believes, as does the industry, that it is an extraordinary decision to place the industry under the umbrella of the Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I acknowledge that the industry is being given within the Corporation a unique level of independence, but the move was unnecessary and will impose unnecessary costs on a very successful industry. However, the Opposition supports the legislation.

         —It is not my intention to delay the Committee this morning, but the reason why these amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill are being reconsidered today has to be stressed because it is an issue which should be of interest to both Government and Opposition members. The reason is that, just prior to voting on the motion for the second reading of the Bill late at night on 21 February, which was the last day on which the Bill was debated, the Opposition was handed two pages of amendments to the Bill and, to compound the errors of the Government, there was no supplementary explanatory memorandum attached to those late amendments.

        As was said on that evening some 10 days ago now, the Government's action showed a callous disregard for the processes of this place. Moreover, it was an example of the Government's dismissive attitude towards the Parliament which has characterised the Australian Labor Party Administration since March 1983, to the extent that we on this side of the Parliament have very serious concerns as to the administration of this chamber.

         —Certainly. But my argument would be that the fiasco that has surrounded the late tabling of these amendments is characteristic, sadly, of the running of this chamber by the Government. The victim worst affected by this Government's very offhanded treatment of rather important amendments to the legislation has, of course, been the horticultural industry itself. No industry, particularly one as devastated as the horticultural industry is, deserves to be treated in this fashion. Whether or not these amendments are to a very large extent technical and administrative is not the point. The point is that the Opposition and the industry affected have every right-indeed, a duty-to satisfy ourselves that the amendments will not materially disadvantage the people we represent.

In view of all the important matters that he should be concerning himself with as Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and as a Cabinet Minister of the Government, I think he has picked up the most trivial and rather unimportant of all issues.

        These amendments now have the approval of the Opposition as well as the horticultural industry. It is a sad indictment of the workings of this Parliament that the amendments were introduced in the fashion that I have outlined. It shows almost a contemptuous attitude by the Government to the Parliament. It is reflected, it is said by some people, in the conduct of Question Time. Moreover, it is indicative of the uncaring attitude of Government Ministers in regard to their responsibilities across the spectrum.

I would remind you, Mr Chairman, that the legislation we are currently dealing with deals with the Australian dried fruit industry. Great was the indignation that Opposition members felt when they found themselves late at night in this Parliament facing two pages of extensive amendments without any explanatory memorandum, as the honourable member for Gippsland has acknowledged.

       <para>
        On that occasion the sentiments of the former member for Port Adelaide, who seven years ago said in this chamber `We have the numbers', came back to haunt the Opposition. I acknowledge that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), recognising that the Opposition had not had an opportunity to pursue these amendments, was gracious enough to allow the legislation not to proceed further and to allow us to go back and consult with the industry and return to the Committee this morning with the amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) and the honourable member for Gippsland have indicated, the opportunity for consultation has now occurred and the Opposition is not opposed to the amendments. The indignation we express now is simply the indignation acknowledged by the Leader of the House-that we should find ourselves facing major legislative change without sufficient warning and without sufficient notice. We have spoken to the Australian Dried Fruits Association. Clearly, as the honourable member for Mallee has said, although it is not delighted with the changes, it accepts them and it feels that at this stage little more can be achieved by further negotiation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a touch of irony in the fact that while we stand here debating the future of the Australian dried fruit industry, I am here as a South Australian representing a portion of that industry and representing a State that has just experienced its driest February for 25 years. That impact on the dried fruit industry has been entirely positive, and I would hope that this legislation has a similar positive impact on the industry, although I cannot be as optimistic as I would like.

         —The Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1990 proposes to amend section 50 of the Trade Practices Act, which relates to mergers and acquisitions. The purpose of the Bill is said to be to remedy a defect which became apparent in a case known as Trade Practices Commission v. Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd. That case related to a transaction by which a New Zealand company, Helenus, acquired 100 per cent of New Zealand Steel.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Through various subsidiaries, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) had an interest in the acquiring vehicle, but it did not control the vehicle which purchased New Zealand Steel. Section 50 prohibits a corporation from acquiring, directly or indirectly, shares in a body corporate if this would lead to market domination or, where the corporation already dominates the market, a substantial strengthening in the power of the corporation to control or dominate the market.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was held in the Trade Practices Commission v. Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd case that a corporation does not indirectly acquire shares in a body corporate where the shares are acquired by a subsidiary unless that subsidiary acts as agent for, or otherwise for and on behalf of, the corporation. This meant that it could not be said that BHP or Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd directly or indirectly acquired shares in New Zealand Steel as there was no allegation that Helenus acquired the shares as agent for any other corporation. This was not new law; the case followed previous authority. The case did not open a loophole, nor did it disclose any omission which had not previously been known of. What the case did was confirm the existing state of the law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trade Practices Commission was naturally concerned about this case, having taken the case and having lost it, and it sought to evoke interest in the decision and agitate with the Government for an amendment as a result. But the Trade Practices Commission went further than was necessary in evoking interest in this particular decision by encouraging speculation that the case had opened a loophole and encouraging speculation that News Corporation Ltd could take advantage of this so-called loophole to acquire the Fairfax newspaper group.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me make it clear: the Trade Practices Commission has a role in commenting on the operation of the Trade Practices Act and it does this by an annual report to Parliament. Indeed, in its 1989-90 annual report, it drew attention to the shortcomings of section 50. But the Trade Practices Commission is not a policy making body. Its role is to enforce the law as it currently stands-that is, enforce the current laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trade Practices Commission has a fine line to walk and it crosses over that line when it seeks to become a player in the policy making process. In this instance, Professor Baxt, the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, went too far. He crossed that line when he made public pronouncements on the desirability of News Corporation's acquisition of Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, an acquisition which was made under the term of office of his predecessor as Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission in 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the New Zealand Steel case was decided, the Trade Practices Commission encouraged the reopening of the decision which allowed News Corporation to acquire the Herald and Weekly Times Group. By connecting that matter, which was a matter of public controversy, with the BHP case it drew a great deal of publicity-publicity, as one would expect, in the Fairfax newspaper group and in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. More than that, nothing could be expected to more excite the back bench of the Australian Labor Party than the possibility of News Corporation maintaining or extending its ownership of the print media in Australia. Indeed, the Labor Party seized on this opportunity to reopen that whole issue, which has been a festering sore for the Labor Party for a very long time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trade Practices Commission has enough work in law enforcement. It compromises its role if it seeks a high profile policy role especially if it becomes a regular repository of media comment. The Trade Practices Commission, by linking the News takeover of the Herald and Weekly Times and by linking a possible takeover by News of the Fairfax Group with the outcome in the BHP steel case, did not distinguish itself in this episode. It did raise a lot of questions, particularly in the business community, about what the Trade Practices Commission sees its role as being.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, Professor Baxt, is leaving the Commission in a short time. The Government should bear in mind what happened in this case when it comes to appointing a successor. It should bear in mind what it believes the role of the Trade Practices Commission should be and, when it appoints somebody to the position, it should have very firmly in mind that the policy and direction of the Trade Practices Commission ought to be enforcement rather than high profile media speculation or, indeed, regular contributions to the public policy making process.
       </para>
       <para>
        A large degree of responsibility for this episode rests with the Government, which is all at sea on competition policy. We have the Keating view, which is a laissez faire view that things ought to be allowed to take place in the market without a great deal of government intervention. I should say that that is his general view, but when it comes to things such as the ANZ-National Mutual merger he is not above intervening himself. Indeed, he came under some criticism from the Trade Practices Commission over that episode, which had a statute that would have allowed a test of that proposed merger to have taken place, but he circumvented that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Labor backbench still consists mainly of unreconstructed interventionists who would like much more government intervention in the marketplace. I hear in the media, even as late as today, that the Labor back bench still believes it can get some kind of inquiry into media ownership and reopen the events of 1987 in relation to News Corporation's takeover of the Herald and Weekly Times. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is not disinterested in this aspect of competition policy. He was the Minister for Communications at about that time; he had proposals of his own but, unfortunately from his perspective, he was not able to carry the Cabinet with him. As Minister for Communications he was comprehensively rolled on that episode as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        As Attorney-General, I hope he takes the opportunity to develop a coherent competition policy. I hope he takes the opportunity to ensure that the Trade Practices Commission does what it ought to be doing-that is, law enforcement. I hope he takes the opportunity, when he has the power to make the next appointment of the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, to redirect the Commission into its primary role rather than allowing it, as with so many other government agencies, to be a free player in the policy making process.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are of course a number of government agencies in this area that all seek to have their own input. For example, we have the Prices Surveillance Authority; the Industry Commission; as I said before, the Keating view; the Duffy view; the Labor back bench view; and we might have an inquiry into media ownership. Whatever it is doing, the Government does not seem to be coordinating its approach across the board in relation to competition policy. It is just another area where the Government, devoid of real direction during this term of office, has been unable to stamp any meaningful direction onto the policy making process and come up with coherent policy initiatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        News Corporation did not at any stage, in the aftermath of the BHP case, evince any intention of using that particular decision, which as I said was not a new law, as a basis for taking over the Fairfax operations. Even under current law News Corporation could hardly acquire shares or assets in Fairfax; it could not acquire Fairfax through subsidiaries if they acted as agents for News, and even if subsidiaries did not act as agents, through aggregation-subsection 50 (2)-the subsidiaries, being related to or associated with News, could be deemed to be in a position to dominate a market. The aggregation provisions would take effect, and thereby any acquisition that was proposed could be prevented.
       </para>
       <para>
        After all of that brouhaha about a loophole, all of the brouhaha about News and the Herald and Weekly Times, all of the brouhaha about News and the Fairfax Group, and all of the brouhaha about an inquiry into media ownership, the new subsection (1aa) which came forth was a bit of a dud. What it proposes is to prohibit a body corporate related to, or associated with, a corporation acquiring shares in other bodies corporate if the result would be to allow a corporation to dominate a market or, if it already dominates the market, to strengthen the power of domination.
       </para>
       <para>
        The object of the new subsection (1aa) is to prevent non-corporations which are bodies corporate acquiring shares or assets where a corporation itself would be prohibited from acquisition. It will prevent the use of bodies corporate which are not corporations being used to avoid section 50. The chances of an acquisition being done in this way are very slight, and indeed I note that the Government cannot point to a case where this in fact has been done.
       </para>
       <para>
        So after all the brouhaha, after all the interest, and after all the expectations that were raised, when the new subsection (1aa) came forth it was not much of a sub-section at all. Indeed, when it was first announced that some legislative action would be taken, it was announced that the proposed law would take effect from the date of the announcement, which was 10 October 1990. When the Bill actually came forward there was no proposal in it, as was promised in the Parliament, to date it from 10 October 1990, but a proposal to date it from 21 December 1990 which was the date on which the second reading speech was made. Even dating it from 22 December 1990, which was a back-down from the Government's original position of dating it as from the date of the announcement in October, does have some offensive aspects.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is, of course, a retrospective law. Retrospective laws can be justified where they do seek to close loopholes which nobody thought existed, but in this particular case, as I said before, all that the BHP case did was confirm the current state of the law, and it can hardly be said that this is a loophole. Therefore, it is very strange when the Attorney-General can point to no practical cases which have occurred in the past that it should be backdated at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        This has raised legitimate worries in the community, and the Law Council of Australia has made a submission to the Attorney-General. The Council has commented on this. In relation to the retrospective operation of this particular Bill, the Law Council of Australia said this:
       </para>
       <para>
        Retrospectivity in legislation of this kind is always objectionable and the practice is especially objectionable where, as in the original announcement, the public was not given any indication of the nature of the changes which were proposed.
       </para>
       <para>
        So far as the Law Council of Australia is concerned, it finds the Attorney-General's Bill especially objectionable, and I am sure that will do a lot to gladden his heart as he comes to pass this Bill through the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is an argument for the substantive change-the introduction of subsection (1aa) into the section on mergers and acquisitions-and it is this: it is technically possible for a non-corporation which is a body corporate to be used by a corporation to acquire shares in a way which would offend the policy of the section. Nobody has an example of this occurring, but it could occur. If it did, it would mean that one could avoid section 50 through the use of a non-corporation body corporate. The new subsection (1aa) will prevent that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course it is hard to think of non-corporation bodies corporate. I notice that the Government has given no examples. It may be that a body corporate which is not a corporation would be a State authority or perhaps even a partnership holding corporate personality or something like that. But one would have to concede that it would be a rare vehicle. I doubt whether one could point to any example where such a body corporate had actually been used for a merger or acquisition.
       </para>
       <para>
        Certainly such bodies corporate were not used in the New Zealand Steel case. In that case, corporations were used, but they were corporations in a foreign country. I have always believed that the New Zealand Steel case was really a section 50a case. The Trade Practices Commission probably took the case on the wrong section and came up with a predictable result. There is a public policy ground behind the substantive new subsection which is to be introduced, and for that reason the Opposition will not oppose it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition does have several reservations. It has the reservation-which the Law Council shares-about the retrospective operation. It also has the reservation as to the way in which this came onto the political agenda. As I said before, the matter was blown up as if the New Zealand Steel case had disclosed some major defect in the legislation requiring urgent attention in the national interest. Of course, the view put around was heightened by the fact that we had a dramatic announcement in the Parliament in October that the Bill would take effect as from October. Although we did not know what the Bill was going to be, it was going to take effect from the date of the announcement. When the actual offspring was brought forth, not only was it a dud, but the date of operation, as I said before, was put back.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legislation to rectify the so-called problem is so narrow that it is unlikely to have a major effect. It does not address the problem which was described at the time as being one which required necessary and dramatic legislation. It illustrates, as I said, something of a trend, which I am concerned about, in the Trade Practices Commission to engage in policy and publicity roles when it should be directing itself to enforcement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another reservation is that the Bill as drafted could be beyond constitutional power because in the new subsection (1aa) it seeks to regulate bodies corporate, not merely corporations. As the Department of the Attorney-General is no doubt aware, the Commonwealth Parliament has constitutional power over corporations. This subsection is deliberately going wider than regulating corporations and seeking to regulate bodies corporate. The whole point of it is to regulate entities that are bodies corporate, not merely corporations. There is a prospect that this could be determined unconstitutional. The High Court of Australia has already ruled that the unconstitutional reach of the section can be severed. So the section can stand with the severing of this part if it is unconstitutional. Of course, if it is rendered unconstitutional and severed, the whole of the Bill in this respect will have no effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to new proposed sub-section (1aa), the opportunity has been taken to make changes to the balance of section 50. The Law Council of Australia has put a submission to the Attorney-General, and the Attorney-General ought to answer that submission in his wrapping up of this debate on these incidental changes to section 50. The Law Council of Australia has said that the need for most of these changes is not clear and that there is a risk that unnecessary changes may have unforeseen effects on the delicate balance of section 50.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is proposed to include references to the words `or likely to be in a position' in section 50 (2). The Law Council believes that this is unnecessary and misconceived. These words have a place in section 50 (1) to enable account to be taken of the future impact of a merger which is yet to be effected. It is not clear why this predictive element should be included in the ancillary provision of section 50 (2), which is concerned with aggregation, when one is considering the existence of dominance as a factual matter. The aggregation provisions of section 50 (2) are to determine dominance or likely dominance of a corporation for the purposes of the section.
       </para>
       <para>
        The relevant other parts of section 50, to which section 50 (2) attaches, can only be section 50 (1) (a) and the proposed section 50 (1aa) (a), as it is only those paragraphs that deal with a corporation's dominance or likely dominance in a market. But each of these paragraphs deals with the position of dominance in a market as a result of the acquisition. The result must be a position of dominance or `likely' position of dominance. Accordingly, the introduction to section 50 (2) of a concept of likely position of dominance is surplusage, as the relevant parts of section 50 (1) and proposed section 50 (1aa) already require the same inquiry post-acquisition. The Law Council concludes that it is unnecessary to make a similar inquiry pre-acquisition because section 50 (1) (b) and proposed section 50 (1aa) (b) apply only where a corporation is-not is likely to be-in a position of dominance. So the Law Council of Australia says that it is unnecessary and surplusage.
       </para>
       <para>
        With legislation like this which is unnecessary and surplusage there are two ways to go. We can say, `It is unnecessary and surplus; therefore, why are we passing it?' or we can say, `It is unnecessary and surplus; therefore what harm will it do if we pass it?'. I must say that I cannot get so excited over unnecessary and surplus words as to oppose right to the barricades the particular proposal. As I said before, that is why the Opposition will not oppose the Bill. But it is a question of public policy that one ought not introduce as a matter of public policy unnecessary and surplus words, because even if they do not have any effect, being unnecessary and surplus, the risk is that some time down the track in a court it can have an unforeseen consequence which nobody at this particular time has managed to figure out.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other reason as a matter of public policy why one ought to avoid unnecessary and surplus legislation is that it does create a degree of uncertainty in the commercial community. The commercial community says, `Why is it being introduced? What does it mean? A government wouldn't introduce it if it were to have no effect; it must have some effect'. Therefore everybody has to go back to their lawyers and engage in the expensive business of taking legal advice. To some degree, it dampens commercial activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course that also has an effect in the courts. The courts come to these statutes, and they generally assume that Parliament knows what it is doing when it passes legislation. I have always thought that this was a dangerous assumption. The courts would be entitled to say, `They must have had something in mind for this. They must have wanted to change the law in some respect. It must therefore be given some effect'. The chances are that it will be given an effect which nobody anticipated at the time. So it is a very dangerous position.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the Attorney-General ought to give some defence as to the effect that he thinks these particular words will have, bearing in mind the submission of the Law Council of Australia, so that it is clear from the parliamentary debate what was actually intended. I have no doubt that such a task is not beyond the Attorney-General. I have no doubt that he will be able to explain that, and I hope that he does so because it may become an issue subsequently down the track when these matters come to litigation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Law Council of Australia also made a comment on new provisions in section 50 (2aa) and proposed section 50 (2ab); it said again that these were unnecessary and may give rise to confusion or unintended implications. The Law Council said that it was unaware of any shortcoming in the law that would warrant further legislation on the question of whether parties who together are in a position to dominate a market would need to act in concert in order to achieve that dominance. It also said the phrase `in a position' as used in sections 50 (2) and 50 (2a) already had a wide breadth and potentiality of application and that the language of both proposed sections 50 (2aa) and 50 (2ab) and that of the reference section, proposed sections 50 (2) and 50 (2a), presupposed a combined and present proposition of dominance. Accordingly, the references in proposed sections 50 (2aa) and 50 (2ab) to needing to act in concert to achieve such dominance were irrelevant. It said that in any event the question of whether the relevant entities had acted in concert in order to put themselves in a position of dominance was irrelevant.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Law Council is the premier law body in Australia. It has put a submission to the Attorney-General's Department. The submission is that the words that are proposed may have confusing and unnecessary effects. After hearing my outline of the Law Council's submission, honourable members will surely agree with me that it is a rather complicated subject which has the potential to have confusing aspects. It is something that the Government ought to be at pains to try to clarify before this matter goes too much farther.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Law Council also commented on the inclusion in proposed section 50 (2a) and consequential reference in proposed section 50 (2b) of the words `or to be likely to be able to exert'; it said that that was misconceived. The question is whether a party is in a position to exert a substantial degree of influence, not whether that party in fact will do so or be likely to do so. The Law Council said that the added language detracted from the strength and width of the phrase `in a position' and concluded that the change was therefore unnecessary and confusing.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the Law Council has done us all a service in looking quite closely at this Bill and has come up with some very strong reservations. They are reservations that we in the Opposition certainly share and it may even be that the Department, after it looks at all these things, could reconsider its position. If the Department is prepared to reconsider its position, certainly it would get support in doing so from the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Law Council also raised another very good point, and that is that there is no consequential alteration to section 50a. Proposed subsection 50a (7), which is designed to exclude from the application of section 50a acquisitions which come within section 50, should be amended to refer to the new subsection that is being introduced, proposed subsection (1aa). There has not been that consequential amendment to section 50a. There ought to be; there is no reason why it should not be in the Bill. By not putting it there at the moment, the Attorney-General is leading to the bringing back of this section at some later stage to tidy it up. That is a very strong point that was made by the Law Council of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should make it clear that I believe there is a place for legal constraints on market monopolisation in a free market economy. There is a place for establishing rules so that the market operates in a fair, efficient way so that competition in a particular market is promoted. There is a case for that. One has to be careful, however, that, in prescribing the particular rules that will enhance competition, one does not go too far and that the Government does not try to rewrite the market, second-guess the market or take control of the market. These things, although they sound technical and have very specific effects, can have quite dramatic effects in the business community.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why it is important to get the rules as right as possible. That is why it is important that when the Government comes into this place it explains the rules as specifically as it possibly can so that not just the Parliament but also those people out in business, and the professional communities that are advising them, know what they are-the rules that are designed to promote that free and open market competition. Because we in the Opposition believe that there is a place for that, we have in the past supported trade practices provisions which are designed to promote that free and open market competition. We believe that, although the progency that comes forth with this Bill is a bit of a dud, it does cover what could be-which has not been shown-a loophole in the future. Therefore, we will not oppose it.
       </para>
       <para>
        We ask the Government to try to do something to get a coherent approach to competition policy, a coherent approach to the Trade Practices Commission and a coherent approach to what its role will be. If the Government can do all that, perhaps the Trade Practices Commission will not feel the need to get out there into the marketplace and start doing the Government's job for it.

         —Despite the claim made in the latter part of the speech by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) that he supports the principle of having standards and rules out there in the marketplace, I suspect that his contribution in this debate on the Trade Practices Amendment Bill is little more than part of the continuing attack that the Opposition has been waging against the Trade Practices Commission (TPC). It needs to be placed on the record over and over again that the Liberal and National parties are against the very Commission that administers the Trade Practices Act that this amendment applies to.

         —The honourable member says `Rubbish', but the Opposition has said repeatedly that it wants to do away with the Trade Practices Commission, with the consumer protection laws and the foreign investment rules. That is what the Opposition is about. On the one hand, it says that it wants to see some protections but, on the other hand, what it really wants is the law of the jungle. The honourable member for Higgins certainly has presented a rather confusing argument. On the one hand, he says that if it will close the gap he will support it and, on the other hand, he says that the Law Reform Commission considers it to be unnecessary. I suggest that the honourable member goes back to the very reason that this amendment has been brought forward-that is, to the case of the Trade Practices Commission v. Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd and Others in which Justice Lockhart made it very clear that he did not support the definition, as the Commission argued, of indirect and direct acquisition.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I note in a paper I have here that Justice Lockhart held that an indirect acquisition was one by someone on behalf of the corporation acting as agent, trustee or nominee. An acquisition by a wholly owned subsidiary or a company that otherwise was controlled by the corporation was not an indirect acquisition unless that agency arrangement existed. What does that mean? It means that corporations can structure acquisitions and mergers through subsidiaries and companies they control without running foul of section 50.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Higgins wants to destroy the very reputation of the Trade Practices Commission. That is why Professor Baxt was attacked. That is why the honourable member and other honourable members have been chipping away at what the TPC does for Australia and the people of Australia. It is not an isolated situation, because the Opposition holds that same view, as I said, when it comes to the Foreign Investment Review Board.

        The honourable member for Higgins has the audacity to say that strengthening the provisions and redefining this provision creates uncertainty, when quite clearly it is the other way around. The need to change this provision, the need to extend section 50 (1), is because of what Justice Lockhart said. It is because of the attitude that he expressed in that case. Otherwise we could end up with a total destruction of the protection that exists under section 50 when it comes to mergers. This amendment, I believe, will close the gap. It will correct a deficiency in the merger provisions of the Trade Practices Act.

        Whether it is claimed that it is only because of the Australian Iron and Steel case-what is often called the New Zealand Steel case-or whatever, the Commission has a responsibility to warn this Parliament of the problems that may arise and that have arisen. Clearly, in view of the decision by Justice Lockhart, there is a need for this change-and I am hopeful that it will overcome the problems.

        For a long time I have had some concerns about mergers. I have been concerned that in the history of mergers there has been a gradual degradation of the protections that existed. As a member of the original inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into mergers, takeovers and monopolies, headed by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), I expressed some concerns at the changes that were being proposed from within the governmental structure and the marketplace. There is a responsibility on both the Commission and the Government to ensure that any problems that arise are overcome. A controlling company should not be able to use a subsidiary or its association with another company to target another company and take over its assets and shares and acquire control.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was obviously an opinion of Mr Justice Lockhart that there must be a legal link of agency. Clearly that was not the intention of the Act and this provision will overcome that problem. There have been many difficulties with mergers; it is not an easy issue. I have sat down with many people and debated what is best. Some people say that the proper way is to have no rules whatsoever: let the strongest prevail. Yet when they are involved, they change their minds.
       </para>

        I have had pharmacists say there should be no controls on the number of pharmacies one can own-but they do not want another pharmacy allowed near their premises. In Queensland there are restrictions on the number of pharmacies one can have and there are local government controls on where pharmacies are allowed to operate. I am not singling out pharmacists, but they are typical of the attitude that is sometimes expressed. When they are the beneficiaries they do not want any rules but when they are under threat they want protection.

        There are often arguments on whether we would really benefit if we allowed all the small companies to disappear and the larger, highly concentrated companies to develop. It is argued that we would be better off letting foreign investors take over Australian companies because they control the markets we export to. That is not an argument I support. I believe there is a need for rules and controls. I accept that higher concentration in a market can be advantageous both in economic and consumer benefit terms. I acknowledge that economies of scale do produce benefits, particularly in the integration of the production process. I accept that there are savings in removing duplication of output. I acknowledge that there are advantages in asset rationalisation and that there can be higher returns from superior management. I also accept that there can be a risk reduction through diversification of operations, which I found many years ago in my newspaper business in central Queensland.

        I understand those things. I understand the importance of being big when it comes to competing in international and regional terms. At the same time, we must look at the national interest, at the public benefit of marketplace ownership and control. That is the prime reason for these provisions. We want to ensure that there is not total dominance, total monopoly, to the detriment of Australians. I am amazed that over and over again in this place members of the Liberal Party talk about the free market concept of letting the forces prevail. I would rather go the other way: whilst encouraging development and mergers to bring about the benefits I have outlined, I would argue that we need to have another look at the Act and go back to some of the provisions that are there.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have seen some changes. In 1977 we removed the clearance provision from the Act. We have changed the Act in other ways. We changed the requirement for testing mergers using the substantially lessened competition test and we introduced the dominance test. I do not support that and I believe we should return to the pre-1987 period. That is not a view I just bring forward now. As a member of the Griffiths Committee, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) and I brought down a dissenting report, which contained a number of recommendations. We went firstly to the substantial lessening of competition test and suggested reverting to the pre-1977 situation. We also recommended that the qualification of substantial market be retained in the prohibition that exists in section 50.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, we argued mainly around the pre-notification requirement for a merger. It is an issue that has been quite contentious, and it did not have the support of the full Committee. However, as one talks around the issue again one starts to understand why this is the better way. At the moment there is no requirement to notify. A company could move to acquire the assets or shares of another company, and there is no requirement for that company to notify anyone. That means that the Trade Practices Commission must find out itself what is going on. It does not have a magic ball it can look into and spot these things. It has to keep its ear to the ground and watch over the marketplace and the media, generally monitoring the situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        If a merger contravenes section 50 the Trade Practices Commission is faced with a very difficult situation. It can only force the new company structure to divest its takeover target. In other words, it has to get rid of the company it either merged with or acquired. That is disruptive for shareholders or anyone dealing with the company, be they creditors or employees, and it should not be.

        To take an analogy in the area of foreign investment, a foreign company cannot simply come into Australia and buy an Australian company, with the Foreign Investment Review Board or Treasury monitoring the situation and, if they find that something like that has happened, then acting. That is not how it works. What happens is that if a foreign company is interested in starting a new business or acquiring a business in Australia or entering into a partnership, if the investment amount is over a certain amount of money then by law it has to tell the Foreign Investment Review Board of its plans. It has to demonstrate to the four members of the Board what are the advantages to Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not a hit and miss situation. It is not a situation where someone on the Board is watching over the rural industry, another member is keeping in touch with the directors of mining companies, and someone else is working in the tourist industry. We do not have such a ridiculous situation when it comes to foreign companies or governments coming into Australia and buying up companies. Instead, we have rules that say, `You shall advise. You shall not only advise of your intention, you shall outline the benefits. You shall demonstrate to our government representatives and the people of Australia what Australia shall gain from what you are doing.'
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently ConAgra took over a large part of Elders. That caused a lot of concern in the rural sector amongst the United Graziers Association of Queensland, the Cattlemen's Union, the Cattle Council of Australia, the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. They were concerned at an American company taking over not just a company but an important part of the production chain-the processing point. This would add to the situation where in north Queensland 92 per cent of processing in the meat industry is now foreign owned, in central Queensland it is something like 85 per cent and in southern Queensland 47 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The industry people expressed immediate concern, but they had one advantage: they knew that ConAgra, by law, had to go to the Foreign Investment Review Board and explain what it was going to do; it had to explain what it was going to invest; it had to explain what the advantages were to Australia in terms of new markets, new technology, better jobs and more jobs. It had to set those details down in black and white, and then and only then-consideration having been given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and by the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-did we have the Foreign Investment Review Board approve this and recommend it to Cabinet.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet what have we had when it comes to internal takeovers, internal acquisitions and internal mergers? We have had a total hit and miss situation where the company has been able to move and actually take over, and it has been up to the Trade Practices Commission to have the nous, personnel and resources to be able to know what has been going on.
       </para>
       <para>
        I argue that the Act ought to be changed so that we establish a pre-notification system for mergers and acquisitions, just as we have in the case of foreign investment takeovers, partnerships or acquisitions. It would certainly help the Trade Practices Commission because the Commission would be able then to assess, I believe in a better way, whether or not the takeover or merger would create dominance in the marketplace. It would see whether the takeover or merger would destroy competition out there in the marketplace. It would place a requirement on the companies to come forward and explain what they were doing and the benefits of what they were doing. If they were not ashamed of it or if they had nothing to hide, then I believe the companies would have no reason not to advise of their merger plan. It would be dealt with, no doubt, in total confidence. There would be no breakdown of that. It does not happen within the Foreign Investment Review Board. It ought not, and I believe it would not, happen with the Trade Practices Commission. It would overcome the stupid situation that if a merger does take place and the Trade Practices Commission believes it contravenes section 50, then either the Trade Practices Commission has to approve it while not wanting to do so or, if it wants to go against the merger, it must force the merging companies to divest themselves of the assets that they have just recently acquired.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also believe that it is proper that there be these negotiations, and if one looks at the present situation, one finds there is an informal structure. When the Trade Practices Commission finds out about a merger or proposed merger, it appears that it makes contact with the merging companies or acquiring company and the parties sit down and talk it through in an informal way. But there is nothing binding on the companies; it really comes back to the Trade Practices Commission knowing about the proposed merger. There is no requirement on the companies to come forward and talk about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do have a process of authorisation, and I believe that if we were to have a pre-notification system, it would strengthen this existing informal consultative process that is used by the Trade Practices Commission and it would enhance the authorisation process, because it would make available to the Trade Practices Commission far better information. It is not a new idea. As I said, it was put forward in our committee of inquiry in our dissenting report back in May 1989. It has been argued before in all sorts of inquiries and green papers and I believe it is needed today. I appreciate that at the time of the inquiry there was argument that the existing system seemed to be working well enough. I argue that it does not work well enough and that we can improve on it.
       </para>
       <para>
        We need to remove the hit and miss process that appears to exist today. We need to do away with this sole monitoring responsibility on the Trade Practices Commission and let there be a legal responsibility and requirement on the companies to come forward and explain the reasons why, because that is the final issue. We want to see better and more efficient companies operating in this country. We want to see them being able to compete regionally within the Asian and South Pacific areas and internationally.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ultimate result of that may be a higher concentration of the marketplace production instruments. But if that is to be and if it is to be in the public interest and for the national benefit, there should be no difficulty in demonstrating that. We need, as I say, to place the onus on the merging companies. We need to ensure that the nation truly is benefiting and the public interest is given due recognition when these mergers take place. I totally support the provisions that have been brought to the attention of this place by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in trying to overcome the gap that exists there because of the decision and the opinion expressed by Lockhart J, but I believe that we need again to reopen this issue of pre-notification of mergers, because in it there is value. Despite the opposition that did come before our committee back in 1988 and 1989, there are now strong grounds for implementing a system that is very much like the Foreign Investment Review Board system, which works in the national interest.

         —The Trade Practices Amendment Bill extends the application of section 50 of the Trade Practices Act, which prohibits mergers and acquisitions that are found to result in market dominance. The amendments are designed to close a potential loophole which would allow a company to gain effective commercial control of another company through intermediaries and thereby circumvent the existing provisions of the Act. Under this Bill, section 50 of the Act will take account of bodies corporate indirectly related to or associated with a corporation when assessing whether a merger or acquisition results in market dominance.

        This issue first arose in the case of the merger between a Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd subsidiary and Helenus Corporation where the Trade Practices Commission (TPC) alleged that BHP had a controlling interest in the vehicle purchasing Helenus. Initially, the Commission sought the divestiture of shareholdings in New Zealand Steel by Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd. The matter was subsequently settled out of court following a number of undertakings being given on the part of BHP and Australian Iron and Steel regarding the treatment of New Zealand Steel.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also some concern that this loophole could be utilised by News Limited in acquiring some of the assets of the Fairfax group. This would seem unlikely, and News Limited has certainly disavowed any such intention. It would appear that such a move would breach the existing provisions of the Trade Practices Act and Professor Bob Baxt, the outgoing Trade Practices Commissioner, has certainly pledged to fight any such move-and I quote him-`all the way to the High Court'. There is thus considerable doubt as to whether this amendment is a pressing requirement for there to be an effective trade practices law. It is however appropriate that, in the interests of consistency and fairness in the application of the law, potential loopholes such as these should be closed.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is the first legislative manifestation of a push by the Trade Practices Commission for greater powers and tougher penalties under the Trade Practices Act, including greater powers to order the divestiture of asset holdings. Before we proceed with grants of greater power to the Commission, we need to examine some of the problems with the application and enforcement of the existing trade practices laws. There is considerable scope for improvements in the administration of the existing law by recognising some of the inherent limitations on the effective pursuit of antitrust policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trade Practices Commission has an important role to play in ensuring the prevalence of competition in the Australian economy through its powers to initiate proceedings against anti-competitive practices. The difficulties with trade practices law arise in defining and then identifying anticompetitive commercial activities. There are many instances in which the existence of monopolistic and other anticompetitive practices is very clear cut. This is particularly true of government-sponsored regulatory schemes where the lack of competition is enshrined in legislation or institutional arrangements. It is noteworthy that the Trade Practices Commission has located its push for greater powers in the context of the need for micro-economic reform, and the Government's efforts, such as they are, are on the same front.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Trade Practices Commission suggests that it needs greater powers to ensure that the fullest possible benefits flow from the micro-economic reform process. Of course, this strongly suggests that there is something seriously wrong with the Government's micro-economic reforms. If micro-economic reform is about ensuring competition, a more active Trade Practices Commission can only be indicative of a failed reform process. We see this in a number of areas where the Government has given the Trade Practices Commission a wider brief in implicit recognition of the failure of its own reforms.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission has been given a mandate by the Government to oversee the deregulation of domestic aviation, where the Commission has already identified and expressed its concern about Government-sponsored barriers to entry into the domestic aviation market.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are also seeing a greater role for the Commission with respect to telecommunications, in association with Austel. It is in the area of telecommunications that we begin to find inconsistencies in the application of trade practices laws. Despite the Commission's insistence that its brief includes the Government's commercial operations, and its claim that the telecommunications market will be `treated in the same way as other markets' we find that the TPC has had little or nothing to say about the merger of OTC Ltd and Telecom.
       </para>
       <para>
        This merger must rank as one of the largest corporate consolidations in Australia in recent times. It certainly results in market dominance of the basic network by the newly created monstercom. The Government has wheeled out a lame duck competitor in the form of a debt-ridden Aussat as its version of competition on the basic network until 1997. Overseas experience with satellite-based competitors establishing networks is far from encouraging. Professor Henry Ergas of Monash University suggests:
       </para>
       <para>
        Foreign carriers are no more interested in competing with the proposed megacom in core network facilities than they are in going to the moon.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet despite the unambiguous dominance of the telecommunications market by the new monstercom, and the anti-competitive implications of this dominance, the Trade Practices Commission has been silent on the merger. We have heard not a word. Nor has the Commission commented on Austel's plans to allow monstercom and OTC to price discriminate between themselves and any third carrier.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are far from being the only examples of inconsistency in the current approach to trade practices. As John Logan et al have pointed out, section 50 of the Act:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . ignores the fact that government has encouraged coalitions such as unions and trade associations to amalgamate into even larger groups so that it can deal with just one industry leader in the relevant group. This . . . imposes on buyers the inevitable costs of cartelisation, which is enhanced by the formation of industry coalitions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government also presides over occupational licensing and a wide range of statutory monopolies that have received little attention from the TPC, despite their dominance of the markets in which they are located.
       </para>
       <para>
        While it is a relatively simple matter to identify the market dominance that results from government-sponsored arrangements such as the merger of Telecom Australia and OTC, private sector mergers and acquisitions present numerous difficulties. The principal difficulty lies in defining the notions of dominance, of market and of offsetting public benefit. The idea of market dominance is inherently ambiguous, given that markets are not discrete entities. Dominance may be identified on a particular drawing of market boundaries but this may be at the expense of recognising markets for substitute goods and services that would mitigate the anticompetitive effects of control over a particular market segment. Markets are often delineated artificially. For example, the print and electronic media are treated as separate markets rather than, as arguably they should be, a combined market for news media.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission subscribes to a static general equilibrium view of economic activity. It tends to ignore the roles of uncertainty and the costliness of knowledge in the decision making of entrepreneurs. What may look to the Commission like an attempt to corner a market may be founded on an entirely different perception on the part of an entrepreneur. Studies of open market mergers and takeovers indicate that they tend to succeed only where they offer considerable benefits to customers and reduced production costs. It is extremely difficult for the Commission to distinguish between anticompetitive practices and returns due to entrepreneurship. Firms may well obtain and hold market share simply by virtue of being continuously more efficient than their rivals. That is what it is all about.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of a hypothetical merger between News Ltd and the Fairfax group, the subsequent increased dominance of News Ltd would stem largely from the failures of the Fairfax group. No doubt the Commission could then cite public interest considerations for its opposition to such a merger, but the example points to the fact that antitrust policy may serve to reward poor business practices and to punish market successes. These ambiguities, coupled with the fact that the TPC is the only body that can undertake proceedings for breaches of the Act, mean that, as a former Trade Practices Commissioner has pointed out, `Its opinions on matters such as market and dominance constitute the de facto law in this area'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission thus has considerable discretionary power, which raises the important issue of the Commission's accountability for its actions. It is essential that the Commission make every effort to ensure that its views on these subjects and its decisions are well known if there is to be certainty in the application of trade practices law. But the fact is that the Commission has not been as forthcoming as it should have been in this regard. It is worth quoting at length what Warren Pengilley, a former Trade Practices Commissioner and now trade practices lawyer with Sly and Weigall, had to say on the subject. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        My concern is that the Commission is not seen to be acting in a disciplined manner or consistently . . . Regrettably, no one is really in a position to comment on or criticise the Commission's decisions, because no detailed reasoning-only a most generalistic press release-is provided by the Commission. One gathers the impression all too often that informal negotiations, rather than disciplined reasoning, governs the result. This cannot be in the best interests of company merger policy in Australia. Neither can it be in the best interests of those who want to know what the law really is (or at least what the Commission thinks it is). Nor in my view can it be ultimately in the best interests of the Commission, which is seen as involving itself in a non-accountable, `clubby' negotiating process.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are words of a former commissioner. Pengilley has cited the Coles-Myer and Bell-BHP cases and the Ansett and East-West Airlines case as examples where the Commission has failed properly to account for its position. The Commission has shown little sensitivity to many of these issues. Indeed, at least one commissioner has expressed a desire to return to the even more permissive notion of `substantial lessening of competition' in assessing the merits of mergers and acquisitions, a definition which the Fraser Government rightly did away with in 1977.
       </para>
       <para>
        Merger and acquisitions policy raises important questions of due process. With the law becoming apparent only during the course of legal proceedings initiated at the discretion of the TPC, the law takes on an arbitrary, retrospective and capricious character. Many of the legal and economic issues raised by antitrust policy are notoriously intractable. As the Commission states in its annual report for 1989-90, `such issues have troubled judicial authorities in countries with a longer and richer history of antitrust enforcement' than our own.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission has questioned the capacity of ordinary courts to deal with these issues and has expressed its preference for them to be handled by trade practices tribunals. Yet none of this seems to temper the Commission's enthusiasm for enforcing its brief. All of these issues need to be better addressed before we proceed with further grants of power to the Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the difficult economic climate, the importance of Australian firms achieving the size necessary for export success, it would be perverse for the Government to sanction an over-zealous Trade Practices Commission now. With recession induced reductions in the size of the various industries, firms may inadvertently come to possess greater market strength. This recession that we had to have, the recession that has been engineered, will have the effect of removing competition. The mere fact that it leads to the elimination of some firms from practically all industries will mean that some firms may find that their competitive position is inadvertently enhanced.
       </para>
       <para>
        Econometric models have shown that a one per cent increase in antitrust cases by the United States Justice Department can produce a 0.17 per cent increase in the rate of unemployment, other things being equal. Similar studies should be commissioned here so that we can better assess the true cost of antitrust policies which include the costs of litigation and the running of enforcement bureaucracies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Trade practices law should also not be put in the position of attempting to remedy commercial concentrations that result from our ridiculous restrictions on foreign ownership, particularly in the area of print media and broadcasting. It has become increasingly obvious that a substantial increase in the level of foreign ownership in Australian media will be necessary to foster a viable and competitive industry structure.
       </para>
       <para>
        The view that there is a national interest in domestic ownership of media outlets is becoming more and more anachronistic in an international news environment that is becoming increasingly oblivious to national boundaries. We often treat overseas entrepreneurs as though they were agents of foreign-and by implication, hostile-powers, rather than business people with legitimate interests and with a contribution to make to Australia's economy and to various industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Trade practices law has little prospect of fostering a competitive market structure in the media industry in the face of xenophobic restrictions on further foreign investment. Interference by the Trade Practices Commission could well result in a further decline in competitiveness if it undermines the viability of existing corporations. For example, this might have occurred had the Commission taken action against the restructuring of News Ltd papers in Sydney and Melbourne in an attempt to protect the precarious position of the Fairfax group. News Ltd should have been free to restructure its operations without having to look over its shoulder at the impact of such restructuring on failing competitors.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has indicated that the Opposition does not intend to oppose the Bill. That is not to say that we do not have criticisms to make. Despite the rather irrational assertions of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), we support-as we did when we were in government-the existence of the Trade Practices Commission and its objectives in ensuring that monopoly enterprises do not grow to dominate a particular market.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, there is a lot for the Trade Practices Commission still to do. It could very well address itself to the market dominance of government trading entities, statutory authorities and the like. It has made sympathetic noises on occasions in the past, but it has never tackled that area. The Trade Practices Commission should be accountable. It should give its reasons for decisions and in doing so, it should engender more certainty into the decision making process, whether it be in connection with mergers or in commerce generally.

         —The Trade Practices Amendment Bill is specifically about market dominance. I too listened to the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) and I would like to express my own view regarding the Trade Practices Act and the Trade Practices Commission. The philosophy of the Liberal Party of Australia is that it deplores the intrusion of government into the operations of business. In other words, it deplores government becoming a WA Inc. or a Victoria Inc. It does not believe in government owning the shop, but I think it accepts totally the responsibility of government to be the umpire in the interests of smaller businesses and of the community at large.

        I think we have to get that matter straight.

That is what Parliament is all about and that is what we should be here for.

        I have taken the opportunity to speak on this Bill because I have great concerns arising from constituent problems in my electorate that I think need more detailed answers from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) than those I have received from the Commission and from certain Ministers relating to trade and commerce. I am referring to the activities in Western Australia of the Australian Northbound Shipping Conference, otherwise referred to as ANSCON.

        It is an interesting aspect of monopoly that when the Trade Practices Act was first considered, shipping conferences were thought to be better excluded. Their salesmanship over many years had convinced even Australians and shippers that they were better serviced by a monopoly. Of course, that is stupid and should be recorded as such. There has never been evidence that a monopoly gets the best price or even the best service, but over time shippers have been convinced that fragmentation of a service might be worse than having to tolerate a monopoly that sets its own prices. There is no competition on prices and in the end, as I wish to evidence today, no competition on service.

        The Japanese market imports 800,000 tonnes of hay each year. It is a very interesting market because the hay is used for feeding cattle-19 million cattle, I think. The beef industry, or the dairy industry as it really is, is very peculiar as there are no large producers generally; they are all very small. Today on the Australian scene, nearly all hay is baled in almost one tonne lots in large, round, six-foot diameter bales or similarly very large square bales. This then has to be broken down into bales smaller than the traditional bale we saw in the paddocks years ago, something about two-thirds of that size.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I asked why hay was exported to Japan in this fashion, I was told that these bales of hay ended up almost in the supermarket; Mum rode a pushbike into town, put one bale on the handlebar and took it home to feed the cattle. So much for Japan and its technology. In terms of feeding stock, it is still at the level of putting a bale of hay on a pushbike; something that a woman can pick up.
       </para>
       <para>
        As there is an 800,000-tonne per annum market for hay in Japan, certain Australian entrepreneurs have made the attempt to sell into that market. Australia now has between 30,000 and 40,000 tonnes of that 800,000-tonne market-not very much-but in the present depressed rural situation, it is a very important bit of business. Farmers are being paid about $100 a tonne for their hay and that is good business.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, from there on the costs escalate at a very rapid rate. In developing this market one of the most successful entrepreneurs in my State and one of my constituents, Mr Robbie Robinson of Midwest Fodder, was able to convince the Geraldton Port Authority, which is the port close to where he operates and is in an area where huge volumes of hay can be grown, to buy a mobile container crane. The Columbus Line was convinced to commence an out-of-conference service into Geraldton and Fremantle. This was a trial procedure which, I understand, was to operate for a couple of years, at which time a more permanent service could be established. There were some problems. The availability of loadings was not as substantial as one might have desired, but it was improving and it was going reasonably well.
       </para>
       <para>
        Overnight Columbus announced it would not continue. This was a huge blow to the Geraldton Port Authority, which happened to have a $4m crane and nothing for it to do. We were then advised that one of the directors of Columbus had made some remarks at a farewell dinner suggesting that the company's reason for stopping was not really that it was short of business-it was prepared to hang in there because things seemed to be improving-but rather that it had been heavied by the Japanese banking system.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wrote to the Commission about this and, to its credit, it conducted inquiries. The gentleman who had been reported as having made these remarks was apparently prepared to admit that he had made some general comment during dinner to a person seated next to him about Japanese dominance of banking, Japanese banks' dominance of shipping and the difficulty of competing against such economic power. That was the way he told it to the Commission. My constituent says that he said straight out that seven Japanese banks had told the company to get out from competing with the conference Line.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not know what more the Trade Practices Commission can do on that matter, but it is of huge concern to me. I am concerned that people who are trying to make available to us a new, large export market are not able to serve that market in the most economical fashion. In this case it involved loading hay out of Geraldton. I might add that there were some difficulties with the local wharfies and a few other things I have had to attack as being un-Geraldton. That was successful with the wharfies in Geraldton. They took very seriously the claim that they were attacking their own town. As a matter of fact, they went to ground and we could not get them to talk to the media. Putting that point aside, in the loss of Columbus-the non-Conference operator-not only did we lose a competitor and a cheaper method of operation, but also we found ourselves back with the Conference, which suddenly does not have enough capacity.
       </para>
       <para>
        It so happens that there are very profitable container loads and less profitable container loads, and the less profitable loads include hay. So when a boat is full the hay is left behind. It is a very sensitive market that Australia is trying to develop at a time when it is experiencing great difficulty getting financial returns on grain, wool and other agricultural products. Here is a market that is profitable, yet we cannot get the stuff out of the country. This poor devil had to road-freight 120 containers of hay 300 miles south to Fremantle, the only port of exit, and yet the ANSCON people are saying, `Stick with us, boys. Ignore our anticompetitive arrangements because we will give you a service'. But the one thing it is not doing is giving a service. It is not shifting the freight that is available.
       </para>
       <para>
        Added to that, I am pleased to say, we are now getting a resurgence in the wool market-not so much in price but certainly in clearance. Australia has actually gone back to selling wool. A lot of that wool will have to be exported through this Conference. What chance do the hay exports have? The wool, because it is dumped and compressed, which maximises its weight in the container, will probably get precedence over the hay. So we will send wool out of the country at a loss but we will keep the profitable hay here. We have an anticompetitive practice that is tolerated by the Trade Practices Act, notwithstanding the efforts of this piece of legislation and notwithstanding the amendments this Government made to the Trade Practices Act in 1989 in the area of international liner cargo shipping. Because all of these deals were done at some time prior to that, the Commission tells me that it really does not have any power to fix this problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a very interesting aspect of monopoly. Many years ago I was the part-owner of a hotel-the Minister will appreciate this story-in the little town of Northampton. My partner ran the hotel, and in the town of Northampton-which was quite a big town 30 miles from Geraldton-there was no TAB shop. Guess what happened? A client started taking a few bets on the side. Of course, the police came and arrested him and my poor old partner was in some trouble as the licensee of the hotel. I was not a member of parliament at the time, but I wrote to the TAB and said, `You've got a monopoly in this business. You should not be out pinching entrepreneurs if you're not prepared to give the service'. Let me say that it provided a service; we did not need any illegal activities in the town of Northampton.
       </para>
       <para>
        That story provides a simple example: if one wants a monopoly the first thing that one has to do is provide the service. I draw to the attention of the Minister and the Parliament that Australia is losing valuable export opportunities because it tolerates a monopoly in international shipping. It still falls for the three-card trick that somehow or other this monopoly will give a better and more efficient service than will come from having open competition. History has proved time and time again that that is not true. It does not work. There is only one way to get the right price and the right service and that is by having at least two people fighting over the same business.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think we have to look at the amendments the Government introduced recently. Here it is, bringing to the Parliament further amendments that deal specifically with market dominance, yet it is continuing to tolerate this situation to the detriment of our international exports, to the detriment of the thing we apparently need most, something to pay for our overseas borrowings-export markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        My constituent tells me that our hay could be very competitive. He has a few little problems. It costs him $450 per container to get his hay fumigated in Australia; the Americans do it for $10. So he has a few little difficulties like that where bureaucracy sticks its nose in. He still has problems, notwithstanding all the arrangements he and the town of Geraldton and the Geraldton Port Authority made to have a shipping service out of that town. But he still tells me that we could be highly competitive in that market and that farmers could make a profit. The clear message is that if we exported all of the 800,000 tonnes of hay, probably half the farmers in Western Australia could give up growing wheat, reduce their wool production and make a good profit from growing hay. All we want is for someone to deliver it out of the country and allow this entrepreneur and others like him to get out there and get the business. But they are being stopped by a Government-authorised monopoly that is clearly not doing its job.
       </para>
       <para>
        If it is too difficult to dismantle the whole conference system as it applies to Australia, which is gigantic, the simple threat the Government should be making is, `Listen mate, go and find another ship and maintain absolute clearances or you come out of the Trade Practices Act; your exemption is cancelled. You are on your own and you will have to compete with your Conference mates in price and service and you will not like that. But lift Australia's production or else'. I think the Trade Practices Act and other powers that exist in Australia are sufficient to achieve this, but at the moment the umpire is actually working against us. I make a determined plea that that be fixed.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have had partial evidence of this. It has been admitted to me in correspondence from the Trade Practices Commission that an international shipping agent admitted that there could be outside interference. He rationalised that when it looked like it might be made the subject of an inquiry, but I will bet that what he said over dinner was, `We were told by the international bankers to get out and stop giving competition to the conference as it applies to Western Australia', and that he inadvertently said it. Of course, when the time came that it might be getting serious, when it was not over a few drinks, he did not really want that problem, having already taken the decision to leave.
       </para>
       <para>
        But that is only half of it. Putting that aside, if you want a monopoly-like the Totalisator Agency Board in Western Australia-you have to provide the service. The Board was not providing the service. It therefore falls on the Government, as the umpire and the regulator, to do something about it-not to hold its hands up in the air and say how tough it is.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have another letter here regarding the fumigation problem. It is obviously written by a bureaucrat, to the shame of the Minister, because it is not true. I am told that this in-container fumigation that the Americans use is preferred by the Japanese because a container can take quite a lot of time going from point A to point B, and it can be reinfested. One can put phostoxin tablets in the container and it will get there as pure as the driven snow. The bugs are actually killed on the trip. The time to do that is before the door is slammed. But no, we have to put things under tarp. This fellow actually has to transport it from point A to point B. It costs him $450 a container-an amount that would be much better put into the hands of economically depressed Australian farmers.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope the Minister will take this on board and see how we can actually sell a few Australian exports. I think it is a fairly serious matter. At the moment the Trade Practices Act is preventing us from maximising our opportunity to service an existing market, and to expand it. There is no hope of expansion. The bloke has these containers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Might I add that one of his other problems, again in the trade practices area, is actually getting hold of containers. He now has to road freight the containers 300 miles north, fill them up with hay, send them off and get them fumigated, load them back up again and send them down to Fremantle where they can sit on the wharf for up to a couple of months before they get out of the place.
       </para>
       <para>
        He has another little problem. Wherever possible the conference denies him containers-boxes, as they are called-and he has to go to all sorts of lengths to get them. It is another part of the monopoly situation. If there is an embarrassing surplus they are given to him, but if it is thought better to hang on to them so as to give them to someone else who returns the conference a better dollar, he will not even get the boxes. It is another aspect of restraint of trade. I think it is worthy of serious investigation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission had a try on the basis of this allegation of interference from the Japanese banking area, but other than that it has really said it is all too hard. Somehow or other people signed their agreements prior to the last amendment, which would have given them some power and influence. If we believe we can tolerate a monopoly which is preventing entrepreneurial Australians from exporting at a profit, then there is something wrong with this system. I would request that it be fixed.

         —in reply-Mr Deputy Speaker, in the debate this morning the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) in a general way dealt with his views on the role of the Trade Practices Commission, the Trade Practices Amendment Bill itself, and particularly raised as a matter of importance the criticisms made by a body such as the Law Council of Australia. He asked that those matters be responded to, and that is a fair request having regard to the fact that the body he is referring to is an extremely significant one. I will deal with that in a moment.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I thank the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) for his contribution to the debate. He is not now present, but I must say I was not absolutely sure of the matters the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) was adverting to, except to say that I thought he was looking for an extension of the powers of the Trade Practices Commission through the Trade Practices Act, a view which may not be shared by honourable members opposite, but I was not absolutely certain what he was driving at.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regarding the matters raised by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), I was not aware he was to speak in the debate until late in the morning. Therefore I had no idea as to the matters he might raise, not that that is an obligation that should be discharged by honourable members opposite, but when he kept staring at me and he talked about correspondence which had not been satisfactorily answered, for a while I must say that I was worried. But I think he was actually referring to a part of the Act which is not within my administration, and no doubt the relevant Minister will pick up the issues that he raised.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, in respect of the matters that came to us from the Law Council of Australia, I think it is worth stating, firstly, that the Bill was introduced on 21 December last year. A copy of that Bill was formally sent to the chairman of the business law section of the Law Council of Australia on 14 January.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Richard St John, the chairman of the Melbourne trade practices committee of the Law Council, was advised on 18 February that the Bill could be debated in early March. I assume it was in response to that that the submission from the Law Council was received by us on 1 March.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first criticism that was made by the Law Council of Australia, which was adverted to in some detail by the honourable member for Higgins, was of the question of retrospectivity. The Law Council divided its criticisms into various areas. Firstly, it said that it considered `that the rationale and urgency for amendments were both dubious'. I must say that I do not share that view. I think that there was considerable worry that advantage would be taken of the interpretation directly or indirectly put forward in the case that became known as the New Zealand Steel case.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Council then picked up another point on the same area, and to quote the Law Council:
       </para>
       <para>
        The explanations now given at best indicate a modest need for some technical changes.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that that is answered by posing the question, `Who could give a guarantee that the gap in the section would not be used?'. I think it would be a very brave person who would be able to say that this was a modest technical change. I must say it would have been very difficult for a government to have taken that chance, because a guarantee could not be given that that gap would not be used.
       </para>
       <para>
        An amendment that extends section 50 to cover an acquisition that is not already covered surely deserves a better description than that given to it by the Law Council, that of a technical change. If one is extending section 50 to cover an acquisition which may well not have been covered, surely it does deserve a better description than `technical'. I must say that I reject that criticism by the Law Council of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the question of retrospectivity the Law Council says:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the practice is especially objectionable where, as in the original announcement, the public was not given any indication of the nature of the changes which were proposed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The retrospectivity does not extend beyond the date of introduction, and I really find the objection of the Law Council to be hardly relevant in this area of retrospectivity. As set out in the second reading speech, the reason for retrospectivity to the date of introduction is to ensure that advantage is not taken of the gap in time between the introduction of the Bill into this place, and the passage of the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not think that the Law Council of Australia has any monopoly on virtue in respect of its concerns about retrospectivity. I accept what honourable members opposite have said, that they took the view that this has to be answered. I think it has to be. As I set out in the second reading speech, I think a measure of retrospectivity is reasonable in this case. As I said, that retrospectivity does not extend beyond the introduction of the Bill. The question of unwittingly and unlawfully committing some act just does not arise. Therefore, I must say that the criticism by the Law Council of that provision can be answered. As I indicated to the honourable member for Higgins, I will endeavour to answer the criticisms as set out in the letter, and as were outlined and expanded upon by him during his contribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second matter raised by the Law Council of Australia was on the question of the indirect acquisition, which is proposed new section 50 (1aa). I say from the start that the honourable member for Higgins did not raise this because it is not a matter of concern to him. He did say in his contribution that it was possible for such an acquisition to take place. He did not put it any higher than that, but he did not take up the view of the Law Council. Nevertheless, irrespective of whether it has been raised by the Opposition, the Law Council's criticism should at least be answered. The criticism is directed, in the view of the Law Council, to the very limited practical significance of the new provision, and the conclusion is drawn that there is no need for such a change, particularly when combined with other undesirable amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        As was volunteered by the honourable member for Higgins, no-one is in a position to say that the practical significance of the new provision is limited. Its purpose is to ensure that a type of acquisition not presently covered is covered. While the gap in the coverage remained, advantage could be taken of it. In our view, the Government has an obligation to close such gaps when they come to light. That is what we have been attempting to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next point is that the amendments are not necessary in response to any demonstrable shortcomings in the present law; the amendments would not have altered the outcome of the New Zealand Steel case. That was another proposition put forward by the Law Council. It has not been suggested that the New Zealand Steel case would have been decided differently. The relevance of that case-again going back to the very hub of what we are on about-is that the judge expressed views as to the meaning of the words `directly or indirectly' in section 50 (1) which tipped the balance so far as that meaning was concerned. There has been an earlier, contrary judicial view on this point.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the question of the incidental changes to section 50 (2), it is again alleged by the Law Council that the inclusion of the words `likely or likely to be in a position' appear unnecessary and misconceived. The words appear in section 5 (1) to enable account to be taken of the future impact of a merger which has yet to be effected. On this side of the House we do not agree that those words in section 5 (1) apply only to a merger which has yet to be effected. The subsection prohibits a corporation from acquiring shares or assets of a body corporate if `as a result of the acquisition, the corporation would be, or be likely to be, in a position to dominate a market for goods or services'. Therefore, if there has been a merger or acquisition, in order to assess whether the section has been infringed, the court would ask itself whether the relevant acquisition resulted in the corporation either being or likely to be in a position to dominate.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the acquisition that may have resulted in a position of dominance can be taken into account in applying the deeming provisions of section 5 (2), it is reasonable to allow the court to also look at the likelihood of dominance when applying section 5 (2). Indeed, if it was not to do so, it would be going down the track of perpetuating an inconsistency of approach with section 5 (1).
       </para>
       <para>
        The next issue raised by the Law Council was that subsection 5 (2) applies only to subsection 5 (1) (a), that is, not to the strengthening of dominance provisions of section 5 (1) (b). That is just not correct. It is just as relevant to apply the aggregation provisions of section 5 (2) in order to reach a decision whether a corporation is already dominant.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other matter raised was the question of the introduction into section 5 (2) of a concept of likely position of dominance, as the relevant part of section 5 (1) and proposed section 5 (1aa) already require the same inquiry post acquisition. The inquiry in sections 5 (1) and (1aa) is in effect whether the position of dominance or likely dominance has resulted from the acquisition in question. When deciding whether dominance exists, section 5 (2) comes into play and enables aggregation of market shares, including that resulting from the acquisition in question. The inquiry as to whether a position or likely position of dominance exists is not the same inquiry as whether that position has resulted from the acquisition in question. That criticism levelled by the Law Council of Australia, as with the other criticisms I have been through, can be answered.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the Law Council had more to say. In respect of section 5 (2aa) and (2ab), it also claimed the words `together with' are unnecessary and may give rise to confusion and unintended consequences elsewhere. Again we say that the amendments are regarded by some-and this is acknowledged-as not strictly necessary. However, the interpretation the amendments are intended to override has been put forward as an arguable case by a practitioner well experienced in the field and the amendment is designed to overcome the argument. It is at least an aid to interpretation and it is arguable, as some people have put forward, that it is not strictly necessary. Nevertheless, we had the view that because the view had been put by a practitioner in this area, it was certainly an arguable case and that it was designed to overcome that argument. It purely could be said to be an aid to interpretation. I do not really see why there was any need to become particularly fussed about it on behalf of the Law Council.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to the Law Council, the reference sections, section 5 (2) and section 5 (2a), presume a combined and present position of dominance, and accordingly the references in sections 5 (2aa) and 50 (2bb) to a future `would need to act in concert' to achieve such dominance is irrelevant. The addition of the words `likely to be in a position to dominate' in subsection (2) and `likely to be able to exert' a substantial degree of influence in subsection (2a) make it desirable, in our view, to leave in the words `would need to act in concert'. That is just simply a disagreement with the way that this should be approached between the Government and the submission of the Law Council of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The question of associated companies is one of the last matters raised by the Law Council. The Council's view is that this appears to be misconceived. It says that the question is whether a party is in a position to exert a substantial degree of influence, not whether the party in fact will do so or be likely to do so. In answer to that I can only say that the amendment does not alter the need to be in a certain position. At present that position, as is understood by us all, is a position to exert a substantial degree of influence. After the amendment what also will be covered is a position to be likely to be able to exert a substantial degree of influence. This amendment again resulted from advice that the subsection needed to be widened so as to catch relationships where it is likely that one would act in accordance with the wishes of another, even though that other is not in a position to produce that result.
       </para>
       <para>
        An example of where the new provision could apply but the existing one may not is well worth going through very briefly. That is where company A has a substantial shareholding in company B but does not have representation on the board of B. It may not be possible to prove that A is in a position to exert a substantial degree of influence over B's activities, but the lower test may enable the court to hold that A is in a position to be likely to be able to exert that influence. Again we have examined what the Law Council of Australia has said but we do not agree with it.
       </para>
       <para>
        In respect of the consequential amendment to section 50a, which was the final issue raised, the view was that sub-section 50a (7) should be amended to exclude the operation of section 50a in respect of acquisitions which also may have come within proposed section 5 (1aa). I think that probably sets out what the concern of the Law Council was in relation to that. In our view this is not needed as section 50a and proposed section 50 (1aa) cover different types of acquisitions. Section 50a relates to an acquisition where the acquirer achieves dominance while proposed section 5 (1aa) deals with another acquisition by a body corporate where another party, a corporation, becomes dominant.
       </para>
       <para>
        On that amendment, the honourable member for Higgins wanted the issues to be addressed in that way-that is, in some detail. Again I think that the interpretation put on the legislation by the Law Council of Australia is incorrect.

         —The Trusts (Hague Convention) Bill 1991 seeks to give effect to the Hague Convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition. A trust is a legal relationship between one person and another by which property is vested in or held by the one person on behalf of and for the benefit of another.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The holder of the property is the trustee who, as the legal owner of property, assumes equitable obligations to deal with the property-that is, the trust property-for the benefit of the other person, the beneficiary, or for some specific purpose. The trustee has property rights against the world at large, and the beneficiary has personal rights against the trustee to have the trust administered by the trustee in accordance with the terms of the trust.
       </para>
       <para>
        No special form of words is necessary to create a trust if the intention is shown or it can be inferred that the trust will be created, but the words must be so used that they are imperative and the subject matter of the trust and the objects or persons intended to have the benefit of the trust must be certain. Trusts may be express or implied by law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Hague Convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition became open for signature in July 1985. A copy of the English text appears in the schedule to the Bill. An overview of the provisions of the convention is easily ascertainable by reading the convention itself. The Bill seeks to give the provisions of the convention force of law in Australia so that Australia may proceed with ratifying it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The convention applies to international trusts, say, where the settler, trustee and beneficiary reside in different nations or where the trust property may comprise Australian and overseas property. The convention sets out rules for determining what domestic system of law may govern an international trust. At the moment, where a trust has aspects extending over more than one jurisdiction the common law rules of conflict of laws will determine which domestic system of law governs the operation of the trust.
       </para>
       <para>
        The legal concept of a trust is peculiar to common law jurisdictions. Indeed it has been said that the law of trust is one of the great inventions of the common law world. It used to be said-I know not whether it is true-that the law of trust was invented at the time of the crusades when knights went off to the Middle East and needed to leave their property in the care and control of some other person in their absence.
       </para>
       <para>
        The non-common law world does not, generally speaking, recognise the legal concept of a trust. Whilst one common law jurisdiction will recognise and give effect to a trust created under and governed by the law of another common law jurisdiction, there is some doubt as to whether such a trust would be recognised in a civil law jurisdiction. The purpose of the convention is to address this by creating a common regime of rules governing both the recognition of trusts and the question of which system of laws is applicable.
       </para>
       <para>
        In essence the convention deals with two issues. First, chapter II sets out the rules for determining which domestic system of law shall govern an international trust. By article 6, a trust shall be governed by the law chosen by the settler or person who creates the trust. If no specific provision is made, under article 7 the relevant law is determined by having regard to a number of inclusive matters to ascertain what law is most closely connected to the trust. The rules set out in articles 6 and 7 are in the main consistent with the approach our common law takes in resolving conflict of laws issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, having identified under chapter II what system of law governs the trust, chapter III specifies how the trust is to be recognised and what legal consequences flow from recognition. For example, article 11 provides that recognition of a valid trust implies as a minimum that the trustee may be sued in his capacity as a trustee, that the trust property constitutes a separate fund and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from the schedule to the Bill which contains the English text of the convention, the Bill has seven clauses. I will allude to the most important. Clause 2 provides that the Bill shall commence on a day to be fixed by proclamation, which shall be a day not earlier than the day on which the convention enters into force for Australia. Clause 4 provides that the provisions of the Bill extend to the external territories. Clause 5 states that the Bill binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth and in right of each of the States and Territories. Sub-clause 7(1) provides that the Bill and convention do not apply to conflicts arising solely between laws of different States or Territories in respect of trusts. Sub-clause 7(2) is in the form of a savings provision, providing that the Bill does not preclude States or Territories from enacting laws to give effect to the provisions of the convention.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should comment on the implications for Federal-State relations. As noted, the intention of the Bill is that the provisions of the convention apply to international trusts and not domestic trusts, which may have interstate aspects. However, in the light of clause 7 (1), this may not necessarily be the case given that the subclause says that the provisions of the Bill and convention do not apply:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . to conflicts arising solely-
       </para>
       <para>
        and I emphasise the word `solely'-
       </para>
       <para>
        between laws of different States . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        A trust may have both international aspects and interstate aspects. If, for example, the trust property is comprised of property situated in different States and in different nations, because of the use of the word `solely' it may be that a trust which primarily is of a domestic nature but also has some incidental international aspects will fall within the provisions of the Bill and the convention. There is no test set out in the Bill to the effect that trusts which are predominantly of a domestic nature will not come within its provisions; that is by virtue of the use of the word `solely'.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) said that as the convention had no effect on statute law, it was decided that it could be implemented by Commonwealth legislation as opposed to uniform State and Territory legislation. That is, of course, because the present law relating to trust is governed by the common law rather than statutes. The Attorney-General also stated that in 1987 the convention was considered by a Standing Committee of Attorneys-General made up of Federal, State and Territory Attorneys, and it was agreed that the Commonwealth should implement the convention by way of legislation. It is expected that the States and the Territories may at a future date enact legislation to apply the provisions of the convention to interstate trusts. This is reflected in subclause (2) of clause 7.
       </para>
       <para>
        Article 26 of the convention provides that contracting states may at the time of ratification make reservations to articles 16, 21 and 22. I have raised with the Government the prospect of making a reservation in relation to articles 16 and 22. Article 16 provides:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Convention does not prevent the application of those provisions of the law of the forum-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, of the nation of the court hearing the dispute-
       </para>
       <para>
        which must be applied even to international situations, irrespective of rules of conflict of laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        Article 16 also provides that effect may be given to another nation's laws of the same character if that nation has a sufficiently close connection with the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian courts will not give effect to foreign mandatory rules unless they clearly form part of the proper law of the trust. Article 16 could create uncertainty for parties involved in establishing a trust. Article 16 does not specify the type of connection needed, but, rather, simply that there be some connection. It is also discretionary in nature, and this compounds potential uncertainty.
       </para>
       <para>
        After taking this up with the Government, I received the Government's reply to my request that it consider reservations to articles 16 and 22. The Government says that there is a presumption that a treaty will be implemented in good faith and it says that, according to the 1987 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade guidelines, Australia has only infrequently made reservations to treaties and, as a matter of overall treaty policy, prefers unanimity between parties on the basis of an agreed text.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's argument is that, where commitments vary from party to party, a degree of uncertainty is introduced and it may be necessary in extreme cases to examine a complex network of bilateral treaty relations within the multilateral framework in order to discover the exact rights and obligations.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I would suggest to the Government that whilst I acknowledge that general principle, it is muted to some extent by the provisions of article 16 itself. Article 16 clearly contemplated that states may have reservations-and indeed provides in its own wording that any contracting state may, by way of reservation, declare that it will not apply the second paragraph of the article.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can understand the general proposition that says that we would like there to be uniformity between states, but obviously those who negotiated the convention themselves realised that there might be some problem in relation to article 16 and therefore made a specific provision. Clearly it was contemplated at the time of negotiation of the convention itself that there might be a real interest in reserving to article 16, so the general proposition is probably of less significant effect in relation to that article.
       </para>
       <para>
        The same might be said in relation to article 22, which again has specific provision in it for a contracting state to reserve the right not to apply the convention to trusts created before the date on which, in relation to that state, the convention enters into force. I will return to article 22 in a moment. The general proposition, whilst I can understand it, may have less significance in relation to article 16.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the notes that the learned Attorney was kind enough to provide to me, he also raised the question of what had been the position of the Australian delegate at the time the convention was being negotiated. His notes to me said that at the conference which formulated the Hague Convention, Australia voted against the inclusion of article 16, which indicated that, so far as the Government was concerned at the time of negotiation, it believed that article 16 was not one which would be appropriate for Australian domestic law. The Government voted against that article on the ground that it was considered unnecessary because it was believed by the Australian delegation that the Australian legal system would allow foreign laws of immediate application to be taken into account without any specific provision for this purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Attorney in his notes disclosed that the matter has been discussed with Professor Michael Pryles, the leading Australian conflict of laws specialist, who is a member of the Australian delegation to the conference. It refers to some work that Professor Pryles has done in this area. The Government says that when it consulted Professor Pryles in February 1991, his view was that while provisions of this kind are a recent innovation-the principle is now accepted-he noted that this is a departure from traditional Australian conflict of laws rules but he said that it had no significant consequences.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would be interesting to know what Professor Pryles's position was. I believe that, from reading that and from other comments that have been made in the legal fraternity generally, Professor Pryles did believe, on balance, that we should make a reservation. I think that is more or less confirmed by the notes the Government has provided to me. I query why the Government is not following the advice of Professor Pryles on that, particularly as this is a departure from established rules. I think it would be advisable for Australia to, where possible, consistently stand by past rules. Notwithstanding the Attorney's response to my request, I am not satisfied that, on balance, we should not make a reservation. I have urged this to the Attorney. He, in his wisdom, has rejected my urging. But I would propose that when this matter goes to the other place, this particular Bill be examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and that that Committee be given the opportunity to investigate this Bill and to form its own conclusions. That Committee has greater powers of investigation because it, of course, is not as tightly controlled as the Committee in this place. It also seems that it has more time for these things and it may be that the Senate, as a genuine House of review, can fulfil that particular function.
       </para>
       <para>
        Article 22, perhaps, has the same generic basis because, as I said before, there is a provision in article 22 to allow for reservations of specific provision, which, of course, does not detract from the general provision allowing for reservations; it is a specific provision in article 22 allowing contracting states effectively to negative the application of that article in relation to their own domestic law.
       </para>
       <para>
        Article 22 allows contracting states to decide whether the convention should operate prospectively or retrospectively. Ordinarily, international instruments only have a prospective operation, but Article 22 provides that the convention shall apply to trusts created before its commencement, unless an appropriate reservation is made.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would be in Australia's interests, as a common law country, for civil law countries which adopt this particular convention to adopt article 22 without reservation, because that would, in relation to their own laws, give the convention a retrospective operation and so protect the position of already established Australian trusts.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, against this is the desirability that Australian legal advisers be given notice of the changes the convention will bring about and that it operate as from the date that the Bill is enacted, especially in light of the fact that it represents, to a small degree, a departure from general common law principles. If Australia were to give the convention a prospective operation, it is unlikely civil law countries would respond in the same way by reserving on article 22. It would be unlikely, in our assessment, that this would provoke a counter-reaction, as it were, which might operate to our detriment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note that, again, the Attorney-General's Department has provided an explanation as to why it does not propose to reserve to article 22. It says that it is for the benefit of Australian trust property that the convention extend to all Australian international trusts, irrespective of the date on which the trust was created and it also raises the prospect that our response of reservation could cause a negative counter-response from the civil law countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said before, I believe that to be unlikely and since they have not had any domestic procedure for dealing with trust law anyway, when they bring it in they probably want to bring it in complete, as in one, and they do not have the specific problems which may arise for Australia, where we have had trusts operating with legal recognition for some time; operating under clearly defined rules here in Australia and a different set of considerations overseas, which retrospectively may change without a reservation to article 22.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would recommend that article 22 be examined in the other place, particularly by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, although I must say that the reasons for a reservation in relation to article 22 are not as strong as they might be in relation to Article 16. The power to sign and ratify a convention and to make reservations is, of course, an executive one, one which the Opposition has no control over, one which the Government, through its executive powers, has complete power to do. If it proposes to sign and ratify a convention, of course, it has an obligation to harmonise its domestic law with that particular convention.
       </para>
       <para>
        The convention itself will bring great added benefits to the law of trusts and Australian trusts operating internationally. It is something that will give greater certainty to Australian trusts where they have international beneficiaries or international trust property. So the convention itself is to be welcomed, as is the Government's decision to sign and ratify it. Therefore, one must say that the Bill is to be welcomed, because the Bill is a necessary consequence of signing and ratifying that particular convention. Therefore, the Opposition supports this Bill. We believe that this is a wise move. We believe that it will give greater protection to international trusts and greater certainty to the legal community and we welcome its introduction and its enactment.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do raise the question of reservations on articles 16 and 22. For that reason, we suggest that that be examined in the other place. Even if a recommendation came out of the other place that reservations be made, unless the other place were to take the extreme step of enacting legislation directing the Executive what to do, it would still be a matter for the Executive as to whether to take up that recommendation and make those reservations. But I believe that the Government, in a show of good faith, ought to consider very carefully any recommendation that comes out of such an inquiry.

         —It is a pleasure to contribute to the debate following the very useful contribution by the learned Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the very learned contribution from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) on this matter. It is true, as they both indicated, that the trust is an invention of the common law-not always one which governments have welcomed. It may have originated as a device to protect the property of knights going off to the crusades, but in the Middle Ages it rapidly evolved into a mechanism for trying to avoid various feudal incidents. It was sought to be suppressed by legislation, but the common lawyers avoided that suppression by various devices. We are taught in trusts and equity courses the device of a `use upon the use' and various other technical devices which enable the trust to survive. More recently, the trust has become a vehicle for other attempts to avoid the revenue and became the subject of considerable public approbation during that period when it was a vehicle used to drive tax avoidance schemes.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Broadly, the trust has been tamed. It is a well-known and useful legal device for the passage of property to trustees to manage in the interests of others, and it has been a long established part of the common law system. Unfortunately, there is no such legal device available in the civil law systems, so there have been difficulties in terms of the reception and recognition of the trust in those countries. The Hague Convention, therefore, provides a very useful and welcome opportunity for international recognition of trusts. Our ratification of the convention, which will be facilitated by the passage of this legislation through the Parliament, will bring this convention into force. Therefore, we will be the third country to sign, which will, in fact, commence the convention in practical operation, and it will mean that the law which governs those matters with respect to the countries which sign the convention will be simplified.
       </para>
       <para>
        The important points about this convention are articles 11 and 12 which set out recognition of trusts, and which state that, as a basic minimum, all signatory countries will pledge themselves to recognition of trusts; that trust property will constitute a separate fund; and that the trustees can sue and be sued in their capacity as trustees and make provisions of that nature. The articles also provide for the registration of trust interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because this matter will command assent from both sides of the House, I welcome the very constructive approach put forward by the Opposition. Obviously, there are minor issues which will be further debated between the parties, but I welcome the undertaking that the legislation will be supported.

         —The shadow Minister and honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) more than adequately described the characteristics of international trusts and the Hague Convention itself. Hence there is no need to go over the same ground, except perhaps to reinforce his request that consideration be given to making a reservation about article 16 of the convention. As he pointed out, our delegate there opposed its inclusion in the first place. There is provision in the convention itself to state a reservation and I believe that the same delegate remains in favour of our doing that, article 16 having being included ostensibly over his original objections.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Again I agree with the suggestion of the honourable member for Higgins with respect to article 22 that there should be a specific reservation, which is provided for in the convention. In this connection also there is the element of retrospectivity, which is of concern to us. Again, my colleague adequately dealt with that point and the argument that might be advanced in favour of it, in that it is, or could prove to be, in Australia's interests for the Trusts (Hague Convention) Bill to proceed in the form it is when it becomes an Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note also that reservations are the sole prerogative of government, and therefore it is not a matter which we can pursue, except to do as the honourable member for Higgins has already said, and that is to have it examined by an appropriate committee of the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        This particular Bill was introduced only two clear sitting days ago, on 20 February. In the interim, there has been a week up, giving us time to consider these issues, that is, those relating to possible reservations, as well as the Bill as a whole and its implication for commerce and the legal profession.
       </para>
       <para>
        There does not appear to be any particular reason for haste in finalising this matter, although I understand that our law does have to reflect the provisions of the Hague Convention before the Executive Government can ratify it. That is apparently true of all conventions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The convention itself was finalised in July 1985, a further indication that there does not appear to be any compelling reason to force the measure through the Parliament-and I am not suggesting it has been forced through the House, but simply make the point that the Senate should be allowed time to consider it more thoroughly than has been possible with the complexity of this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The implications and details of the legislation have had some examination-and certainly the convention itself has been given the attention of academic lawyers in Australia-but it does not seem to be to have been widely considered by practitioners in the field, although I stand to be corrected on that.
       </para>
       <para>
        We understand that Australia has been an essentially common law country in the context of trusts and international trusts to date. It is distinguished by some of the other parties to the convention, or intending parties to the convention, that there will be some very complex outcomes of that circumstance, with those other countries being essentially or entirely, in some cases, statute law countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not know of any precedent for an approach such as the one before the House at the moment, Mr Deputy Speaker. I certainly know of none. Again, I think that is in itself a reason for making haste slowly in the matter. Again, it supports the contention of my colleague and the Opposition in its entirety that a Senate committee reference is desirable and I would urge that course upon our colleagues in the Senate, particularly in connection with possible reservations being stated to article 16 and 22.

Is it a fact that the Treasurer told executives of the John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd that his motives for getting involved in the Herald and Weekly Times takeover were a desire to see the Melbourne Herald group broken up and to hurt Fairfax? Is it a fact that the Treasurer recently told members of the Caucus communications committee that an inquiry into media concentration could unnecessarily antagonise Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd at the time of the next election? Is it also a fact that the Treasurer's interventions in the area of media policy have helped to send most media operators broke or near broke at the cost of hundreds of jobs? Has the Prime Minister required the Treasurer to explain his interference in another portfolio; if so, what explanation did the Treasurer give? If not, when will the Prime Minister impose some discipline on this rabble of a government?

         —First of all, let me pick up that part of the Leader of the Opposition's question which went to the problems in the media which allegedly have been caused by the Treasurer's interventions. As I think anyone knows, the industry as a whole is going through a massive catharsis as a result of excesses by particular individuals going back over a period of time which had nothing whatever to do with anything said or done or allegedly said or done by the Treasurer-and that is a matter which is clearly understood. If one pays excessive prices for assets in the media, prices which are not capable of sustaining the interest burden in terms of the cash flow associated with that enterprise, one will see the sorts of results that have in fact occurred.

        The fact is that in regard to the media the major contribution of this Government has been to introduce cross-media limitations so as to introduce a greater degree of competition across the media generally than existed in this country before.
       </para>
       <para>
        Coming to the question about the Treasurer, I make two observations: firstly, I understand that the Treasurer has today denied the allegations that are in today's press, and I accept whatever he says about that. Secondly, if the Leader of the Opposition has any guts, he would ask the Treasurer himself.

         —Today, I released a study for the national campaign against drug abuse which sets the methodology for measuring the costs of all drug abuse in Australia. In that regard, it estimated that in 1988-the last year for which figures were consistently available right across the country in all the areas under consideration-alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs cost our community more than $14,300m. This is really an estimate of the value of resources which are unavailable to the community for consumption or investment as a result of past or present drug abuse.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What is very important in that estimate of $14.3 billion is that there are many areas that are not included, such as the cost of absenteeism, passive smoking and other parameters of lost productivity. Looking at estimates of amounts that cannot be fully quantified at this stage, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the real cost of drug abuse in Australia could be at least double that $14 billion estimate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make three important points about the Government's policy on drug abuse. First and foremost, that industry loses at least $3.7 billion each year in direct costs because of drug abuse. So I said this is a minimum amount because it does not include the costs of absenteeism and poor workplace performance. When one considers that approximately one in 10 Australian adults suffer alcohol-related brain damage, one gets some indication of the impact it has on our productivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not up to government alone to address these issues. It really needs a total community consensus approach. It requires employers and unions to cooperate with government and industry to reform these problems in the workplace, and particularly in drug education and support programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal Government has taken very significant steps, as people are aware, in reducing tobacco and harmful alcoholic consumption in Australia. We have seen the tobacco advertising print media ban most recently and the ban on smoking on domestic flights, as well as other responses. Very importantly, we have to recognise that at a cost of at least $14 billion per annum the Government will be continuing to take action on this front. The conference that will take place in April in Melbourne will be a very important one because for the first time in Australia it will bring together in the one place government and, more particularly, employers and employees to consider the implications of the costs of alcohol and drug abuse in the workplace.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite clearly and unequivocally, it shows that the most important contribution this study can make is to stimulate us to think in terms of the economic cost of drug abuse, outside the social and personal costs of those 26,000 Australians who die every year. It has really put the cost of drug abuse fairly and squarely on the economic and industry agenda.

         —My question is directed to the Minister for Community Services and Health. I draw the Minister's attention to two issues regarding acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-both recently highlighted in the media. The first issue involves a proposal from Western Australia for compulsory testing for HIV-AIDS of all blood samples taken in that State. Secondly, I raise the results of a recent survey which claims that there was an increase in support for the quarantining of people with HIV-AIDS in Australia. Is it intended to compulsorily quarantine people with HIV-AIDS, and does the Government intend to fund compulsory testing for AIDS?

         —I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. The proposal put forward by the Western Australian Opposition health spokesperson, Kevin Minson, to test all blood samples for HIV is wasteful and irresponsible and reveals a depth of ignorance about HIV and AIDS and its prevention. It is impossible to estimate accurately how much this proposal would cost. With hundreds of thousands of blood samples collected, it would undoubtedly run into tens of millions of dollars. At a time when resources for health care are in short supply, this level of expenditure is entirely unjustified in terms of benefit to public health. For example, in Western Australia, there have been a total of 109 cases of AIDS and a total of 581 reported HIV infections, or about 0.03 per cent of the population. Already there have been more than 100,000 HIV tests carried out in public laboratories in Western Australia since 1987, and more than 200,000 tests carried out by the blood bank in that State. Many if not most people at risk of HIV infection have already been tested for HIV; some have been tested several times. Currently, the costs of HIV testing at blood transfusion services are shared between the State governments and the Commonwealth.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The additional costs incurred by compulsory testing of all blood samples would not in fact be borne by the Commonwealth. I think it is important when one discusses these kinds of proposals with respect to AIDS to recognise that the Australian situation is somewhat different from that in the United States. Under the leadership of my predecessor, we acted early; we developed a very effective preventative program; and we have been able to achieve an approach to AIDS which is the envy of many countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
       </para>
       <para>
        To refer briefly to the second part of the honourable member's question, I am aware of the reports of a survey conducted by George Patterson Advertising which showed that nearly half of Australian respondents were in favour of quarantining people with AIDS. This survey was also carried out in a number of other countries, where around one in four respondents had similar views. The Government's own research does not support the findings of the George Patterson group. In June 1990, a survey commissioned by the Government found that over a six-month period in 1990, approximately one in four Australians-not one in two-supported the idea of isolating people with AIDS. The total sample size in this survey was 4,000, which is greater than the 2,800 sample in the George Patterson survey.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am concerned that so many people appear to be unaware of the facts about HIV infection and AIDS. HIV is not highly infectious and can only be transmitted in very, very specific ways. Quarantining people with AIDS is unnecessary and inappropriate as a routine health measure. As you know, Mr Speaker, Australia interacts with the rest of the world. Isolating people with HIV-AIDS in Australia would not prevent the virus being brought into the country. To commence and continue to quarantine or isolate people with HIV would require regular testing of the entire community, which has been costed at more than half a billion dollars annually. In Australia there is plenty of evidence that our education efforts, as I have suggested, have paid off.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only this week in an article in the British Medical Journal, the Lancet, we were commended for our strategy in relation to AIDS as being highly effective. In this area of AIDS we have, with bipartisan support, over a substantial period made very, very significant inroads. We have done so at considerable cost, but one much less than the cost projected in these ideas that I have just been discussing. I hope that we can go on in a bipartisan way and ensure that Australian people are protected but in ways which are much more cost-effective than those suggested.

Nothing was done of a structural nature in all of those years. There was a Labor government for three years in those 25 years. The Opposition was in office for 22 of the 25 years. Nothing structural was done until this Government came to office in 1983. As I said, by then the debt damage had been done. The structural changes which have taken place from 1985 to this period-more of which we will see in the Prime Minister's statement next week-have been initiated by this Government. Members of the Opposition should not suggest that any smarmy question they ask has the slightest virtue whatsoever.

         —The question that has been asked by the honourable member for Grey almost certainly was precipitated by the announcement that in about the middle of this year there would be a further reduction of 50 staff employed by AN in Port Augusta. I think the honourable member for Grey is also aware of the fact-and the content of his question indicates that he is-that in 1988 AN made an announcement that it would seek to reduce the number employed in Port Augusta to about 1,312. That represented a reduction from then until the middle of 1992 of about 400 employees, and that most recent announcement concerning 50 people is part of that 400. There are difficulties in attempting to determine the extent to which there may be redundancies associated with AN or, for that matter, any other type of business or transport operation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think people are generally aware of the fact that, as a result of very significant improvements in technology, management and work practices, AN has been able to bring about a significant improvement in its productivity. It is required under the Australian National Railways Commission Act to pursue improvements in efficiency and productivity and it has been doing that. It is interesting that one of the reasons for this Government's attraction towards the possibility of our becoming more involved in rail development-particularly through the proposed National Rail Freight Corporation-is the success achieved by AN, not only at management level, but also as a result of the very constructive and intelligent responses we have had from the unions associated with the rail activity of AN.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can understand the concern of the honourable member for Grey about those developments because he represents the Iron Triangle. He represents that large proportion of railway employees and he represents them admirably. I emphasise that AN does have that legislative responsibility to pursue improvements of that kind. But we should keep in mind that, to a large extent, the future of AN and rail operations in Port Augusta and anywhere else in Australia, particularly on the mainline rail links, will be dependent upon the success of that National Rail Freight Corporation which we will have in place and operating from 1 July this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        If that achieves the objectives that we and the State systems have set for it-and those objectives include improvements in efficiency and productivity-to the point where that transcontinental rail freight operation will become profitable, I think it is likely that, apart from any possibility of labour restructuring in the railway industry, there will be an increase in employment in that industry. That will come about because if we can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of rail, it will be able to take back an increasing proportion of that increasing national freight task.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we look at the geographic and strategic location of Port Augusta-and the honourable member would be aware of it as he represents the area-we realise that it is obvious that it will have a central role in the development of Australia's rail industry. So Port Augusta's interests lie in our making sure that it can be done efficiently and that we can get improvements in productivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we want any further assurance of the type of commitment that AN itself has brought to Port Augusta, we need to look no further than the fact that it has now committed $3m to upgrading and modernising the workshops there. There is a commitment on the part of AN to Port Augusta. People there need have no fear about the future of Port Augusta in the Australian national railway industry. Its future is assured and those people have a secure future because they will be part of it.

         —What I said was that if the Commonwealth continued to run surpluses of that variety there would be no debt in three years. The honourable member left out the preamble. I do not know which quote he has, but I will give him the benefit of the doubt that he did not see it. Let me assure him that that is what I said.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let us ponder for a moment on what that means. If the Commonwealth continues to run surpluses by virtue of the tightness of this Government's grip on outlays, within a relatively short space of time we will have the capacity to repay the debt of every Australian government since Federation. That is, there will be no bonds outstanding whatsoever. The issue for the Commonwealth will then be whether it uses its surplus to buy assets. That is why at that point consideration would have to be given to deciding whether in fact the policy of running surpluses of that variety should continue.
       </para>
       <para>
        This means that, given the fact that outlays have been about 2 percentage points of gross domestic product (GDP) below receipts, we have been in a position, were we of the view that we did not need the surplus, to be able to hand back about $8 billion to $9 billion worth of tax cuts and still have a balanced Budget. For the moment, that position has been eroded by the recession and by the stabilisers operating on the Budget. But the fact of the matter is that we will still produce a surplus-as I have said, the third in a row-from the only government that has ever produced a surplus in Australia's history as a Federation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The last part of the question asked, `When are our policies going to work?'. How could the honourable member ask such a question when his Party bequeathed to us a Commonwealth Budget deficit of 5 per cent of GDP? It is no good the honourable member rattling his head.

         —Over the years the number of people visiting the reef has increased very rapidly; the increase is probably in the order of 10 per cent per year. As a result, we have to find additional resources to support particularly the areas of infrastructure and research into the future of the reef. Currently, the total budget for day to day management of the Great Barrier Reef is about $14.6m. The Commonwealth contribution to that is just over $12m and the Queensland contribution is $2.6m. We intend to establish a Great Barrier Reef Marine Park management fund and ensure that the funds collected there will flow back directly into the management of the Great Barrier Reef. We will not be diminishing in any way the Federal contribution. Rather, this will top up the money that will be available.

       <para>
        It is anticipated that this scheme will provide for increases in field staff, interpretive centres, public moorings and, very importantly, research projects. So it will enhance the reef area. Council members do consider that it is appropriate that people who make a profit from the reef should put something back into it. We are not asking for much of a contribution from them. We are looking at about one per cent. That is under $1 for an $80 ticket out to the reef.

       <para>
        Consultations have been under way for about a year with the tourist industry, and though of course not everyone supports the proposition, some people do, because they see the value of it. Frankly, if you ask users whether they are prepared to put something back into the protection of the reef, I think they are prepared to do that.

       <para>
        We are not looking at introducing this immediately. This will only be introduced after continued consultation. It will be referred back to the next ministerial council with a view to its introduction in the middle of next year.

       Mr Speaker, I move this motion of dissent from the ruling that you gave on the point of order raised by the Leader of the House against the background not only of what has occurred today but also of a series of incidents in this House since the Parliament resumed this year, which in the eyes of those on this side of the House, and I believe in the eyes of any objective observers of the conduct of this Parliament, represents a massive imbalance in the conduct of the affairs of the House by you as Speaker.

      <para>
       I go back to what I was saying. In his question a number of observable facts were raised by the honourable member for Pearce. The first of those was that in the last election campaign every man and his dog knows that the Government played the environmental vote for all it was worth. It tore up commercial understandings with Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd; it brought the wrath of one of the most respected businessmen in Australia, Sir Arvi Parbo, down on the head of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) is nodding in agreement because he was in agreement with what Sir Arvi Parbo had to say. Everybody knows that the Government in the last election sold its soul to the environmentalists in order to try to get a few grubby second preferences. It boasted about it: Richardson boasted about it; Hogg boasted about it; Hawke boasted about it; they all boasted about it.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, ultimately, the consequences of that have now come home to haunt the Government. The consequences of giving in to the cave dweller mentality and attitude, as the Minister for Resources has described it, has been that there has been a crisis of confidence, an absolute paralysis of confidence, in the attitude of the resource investment sector of the Australian community to the policies and attitudes of this Government. That was the reason why the honourable member for Pearce asked his question. It was in direct response to the conduct and the policies of this Government. Not surprisingly, in asking that question, the honourable member for Pearce drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the very fact that in the run-up to the last election the Prime Minister had behaved in the most politically expedient way, with total indifference to the long term national interests of this country. We have an investment crisis in Australia. We have a crisis--

       The reason that we have a crisis of business confidence in Australia now, the reason that we are facing four quarters of negative growth, the reason that we have people walking away from investment decisions and the reason that we have thousands of businesses going bankrupt is that nobody who has a dollar to invest any longer trusts the word of this Government. Because the Government was prepared and willing to break its word on Coronation Hill and to grovel to the mad environmentalist movement in Australia, the Opposition has asked this question.

       We ask this question against the background of the second observable fact that I referred to earlier in my remarks, and that is that over the last week it has been notorious around this building that there is a pitched battle inside the Cabinet regarding the issue of resource security. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) does not want it; the Minister for Resources does want it. The Prime Minister used to want it and half promised it; now he is sorry he did and is going back on his earlier commitment.

        —I think your ruling is wrong. I dissent from your ruling and the Opposition dissents from your ruling, because the effect of your ruling is to prevent the Opposition asking legitimate questions based upon observable political facts around this building, based upon the policies, conduct and failures of this Government. If you are seriously saying that it is no longer in order for the Opposition to come into this Parliament and seize upon something that everybody knows is happening around this building, to ask a question based on that and, in the process of asking that question, to make some critical or sarcastic comment about the conduct of the Government, then I put it to you, Mr Speaker, and the entire Parliament that you are not only seriously circumscribing what we are allowed to do but also running contrary to the rulings, practices and conventions of this Parliament over a long period.

      <para>
       Many people from the floor of this House have had occasion to remind not only you, Mr Speaker, but also a number of your predecessors that ultimately the skill and respect a Speaker commands in this place depends not only on the literal and fearless application of the Standing Orders but also on a fundamental sense of fairness and balance. It also depends fundamentally on a willingness to require of both the Government and the Opposition a certain degree of give and take, recognising that a government has a right on occasions to use the facility of Question Time, as it relentlessly does and has on both sides of this Parliament, for partisan political purposes. But, in doing that, the Government has something of a sacred obligation not to abuse that right.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Speaker, I put it to you that over the last several years, and most particularly over the last few months, this Government has relentlessly and indifferently abused the right that the Treasury bench gives it in relation to the Question Time proceedings of this Parliament. Time and time again, we on this side of the House have witnessed the spectacle of Ministers going on and on in a most boring and unproductive exercise, abusing the privileges and prerogatives that are given to them in this Parliament, without any let, hindrance or interference from you. Yet you rule in favour of a point of order which, in the minds of the Opposition members, has the effect of not only preventing us from asking certain questions but also influencing the manner in which those questions must be asked.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Speaker, you have been in this Parliament long enough to know that not only is the literal content of the question important but so also are the atmospherics in which that question is asked. You have been in this Parliament long enough to know that it is not only the literal application of the Standing Orders that is important but also the willingness of both sides of Parliament to accept that the decision you have made, the judgment you have given and the response that you have provided to a point of order represents a fair and impartial exercise of your powers and privileges as the Speaker of this Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       It would be no exaggeration to say that over the last few weeks there has been quite a deal of public debate and debate in political circles about the job you are doing as Speaker. I do not pretend for a moment that the job of Speaker is an easy one; nor do I pretend for a moment that you, Sir, do not bring to your duties, in your own mind, a sincere application. But let me say to you that the attitude of disbelief on this side of the House about your conduct as Speaker is at a higher level of frustration and intensity than I have known at any time over the past 10 years in relation to any Speaker in this Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       I say that very seriously and I say it out of a respect for the position you occupy. I put it to you that the fundamental problem we have with your conduct as Speaker-as illustrated by the fact that we are moving a very rare motion of dissent from your ruling-is that we believe you display a lack of balance and that you display bias towards the Government side of the Parliament. We believe that that was illustrated in the ruling you gave today.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have believed that it was illustrated in other things you have done on earlier occasions. When I think back to the sorts of questions that have been asked and the sorts of answers that have been given in this Parliament over the past five or seven years, any objective observer would have to observe that the question asked by the honourable member for Pearce, erudite though it was, was relatively tame compared with many of the things that have been said, many of the questions that have been asked and many of the answers that have been given.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would be speaking for every member of this House and for many thousands of people throughout the community when I say to you that it is a very unbalanced Parliament. It has a very erroneous Speaker. It is a very ill-based ruling that allows the abuse of Question Time by people such as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who are able to distort and lie about the past, who are able to misrepresent the present, and who are able to give false hopes about the future.
      </para>
      <para>
       Yet it is apparently denied of the honourable member for Pearce the right to ask a simple, searching question based on observable facts which are known to everybody. It is for that reason, Mr Speaker, that I and the Opposition move profound dissent from your ruling.

        —I second the motion, Mr Speaker. I indicate to you, Sir, that the very best construction I can place on the ruling you have just given is that you have made another mistake. Yesterday we had to draw your attention to the fact that you made a mistake in ruling on a matter raised by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). When we brought that to your attention we also drew your attention to the fact that you had given the same ruling, again incorrectly, on 9 October.

      <para>
       If you allow this ruling to stand, whatever credibility you have left as Speaker of this House will, of course, flow out the door with you. The question that is raised by my colleague the honourable member for Pearce is quite clear. It is the kind of question that is asked from both sides of this House on a daily basis. There are preambles on a daily basis to almost every question that is asked and which you have not ruled out of order.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is important to be able to illustrate to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or the Minister to whom the question is being directed some background information to allow the question to be properly answered. I want to repeat the question that was asked today so that there will be no misunderstanding on the part of you, Sir, or any other member of this House. The question read as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       Does the Prime Minister deny that the days the Government has spent agonising over how to solve the problem of resource security are a direct result of its strategy of playing the environment for every vote it can produce?
      </para>
      <para>
       The second part of the question states:
      </para>
      <para>
       Even if the Government finally comes up with some sort of legislative backing for forestry projects, what value does the Prime Minister seriously expect anyone to place on it in the light of the Government's appalling record of using the environment as a political football without regard to the national interest?
      </para>
      <para>
       It is a question that is well within the ambit of standing order 144, which you, Mr Speaker, are relying upon to rule the question out of order. Apart from moving the motion of dissent, the Opposition asks you to reconsider your ruling because when you leave this chamber and you reflect on what has taken place here this afternoon, you cannot come to any other conclusion than that you have ruled incorrectly. If you shake your head and you indicate that you are convinced that you have not ruled incorrectly, you are admitting that you have ruled unfairly. Mr Speaker, you have given a number of examples in recent days and recent weeks of what we in the Opposition believe to have been unfair rulings so far as members of the Opposition are concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       I know that I would be straying from the motion that is before the House if I went too deeply into this, but it would be interesting for you, as Speaker, to look at some of the video transcripts of what has taken place here in Question Time since the televising of Parliament. One area in particular was when the Treasurer (Mr Keating) seemed to be sending to you a signal as to what action you should take in relation the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown). On that occasion, as on this occasion, we believe that you acted unfairly.
      </para>
      <para>
       I bring you back to standing order 144, which states clearly, as you have indicated, that members must not debate a question. There is no debate contained in the question which I have just re-read to you. What it does do is state a number of facts to provide a basis upon which a question could ultimately be put, and that question of course was put and, because it was embarrassing to the Government, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) rose to his feet, took a point of order and suggested to you that it should be ruled out of order. You acquiesced without giving due consideration to the matter. You have acknowledged that you, having reflected on it, have not made a mistake. So, therefore, I say to you unequivocally that you have ruled unfairly and in a very biased way in favour of the government of the day. Mr Speaker, we have asked that you reconsider this. You have indicated that you will not. So that leaves us with no option but to vote in favour of a dissent from your ruling.
      </para>
      <para>
       We point out also that, during the period of your speakership, you have suspended no fewer than eight members of the Opposition. I acknowledge that there was one occasion when even you could not avoid suspending or naming a member of the Government, which ultimately led to his suspension. Mr Speaker, we dissent from your ruling in an unequivocal way. We believe that the ruling that you have given today is not only a disgrace to you personally but also a disgrace to the office that you hold.

        —It is very useful for us to have this debate. Wide-ranging though the Opposition's contribution has been, it is a fairly simple discussion of what is after all a point of order. It is useful because it provides an opportunity to draw attention to the behaviour of the Opposition-and this has been noted by other commentators, most recently by Laurie Oakes in the Bulletin-since the decision was taken by this Government to televise the proceedings of Parliament. The Bulletin article on the behaviour of the Opposition, of which this is a piece, was entitled `Birth of a stunt merchant'. That is the situation which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has inflicted on this House through his total incapacity to control his frontbenchers and his backbenchers when it comes to dealing with issues in Question Time. He is suffering enormous frustration in opposition.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The person who started this process, the person who presented the original question, has more frustration than most because he has been used to ruling the roost in the Senate. He has come down here and found life extraordinarily difficult. His frustration is taken out here on the Leader of the Opposition. There has been a series of totally absurd propositions put by the Opposition in defence of its dissent from the Speaker's ruling. They are absurd propositions which can produce nothing but disorderliness in the House if that is going to be the basis on which Standing Orders are applied. The number of members thrown out of this place by any particular Speaker, whether there are more from the Opposition or from the Government, is totally irrelevant.

        —Of course it is. If it is relevant then the fact that Speaker Snedden threw out eight Opposition members and only one Government member during the time he was in office indicates that Speaker Snedden was biased. Is that the Opposition's position? The Opposition makes a casualty figure interpretation of standing orders, and unless the dead bodies are equal on both sides the Standing Orders are not being upheld. What a totally absurd and illogical proposition-there have to be four dead Government bodies for every four dead Opposition bodies. The fact that Speaker Snedden had eight dead Opposition bodies to one dead Government body equals, ergo, Speaker Snedden was a biased Speaker, a disgrace to his office, and all the other epithets that the Opposition has thrown on the present Speaker in this place since he has been in office. That is a nonsense. One is thrown out of this place, be one in government or opposition, for disorderly conduct and for no other reason. Members of the Opposition love this.

        —Indeed! Members of the Opposition are sensitive to it because they have had their strategy exposed. This dissent motion is a piece of that. Ever since it has been decided that Question Time should be broadcast the decision has been taken by the Opposition to disrupt it because there are features of the Standing Orders associated with Question Time that they have discovered do not suit them. The fact is that the Standing Orders in relation to Question Time place very strict limits on the way in which a question can be asked and very broad limits-I am conceding this point-on the way in which it should be answered. That is perfectly correct. Let me read from the Standing Orders for the members of the Opposition. It is pertinent to this debate. I will read the rules which apply to questions.

        —There is nothing so revolutionary, radical or disorderly than a Tory denied his right to rule. From the radical revolutionary Tories who have now been denied their right to rule for eight years, we have had disruption in this place. The Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), did us a very great service by reading out the question that was put to the Prime Minister by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). As he read that out, every single person in this chamber and every single person listening to this debate recognised clearly that a standing order which provides that in a question there shall be no argument, inference, imputation, epithet or ironical expression, could clearly not sustain such a question as that asked by the honourable member.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I remind the chamber and those listening that until today, only one question in this session had been ruled out of order and that question was from our side of the House. The Speaker ruled us out of order. This is the Opposition's first experience-not ours-of having a question ruled out of order. When expressions such as `playing environment for every vote', `appalling record' and `using environment as a political football' are used, to come to an interpretation that that is orderly within the meaning of the Standing Orders is to render the Standing Orders meaningless.
      </para>
      <para>
       When those on the other side of the House were in office, they had ample opportunity to alter the Standing Orders. They still have ample opportunities to put propositions to us. As far as I know, the only Opposition suggestions that have been placed before the Government-and not in this Parliament but in previous parliaments-go to the question of shortening Ministers' answers and tightening the definition of `relevance'. The Opposition has put those propositions forward. It has never ever, to my knowledge, put forward a proposition to us about these disciplinary areas, as far as the question which is asked is concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       The reason for that is simple. The reason the Opposition is challenging it now and the reason this dissent motion is before us is the televising of the House. Even though no-one is watching us on television-a casual look at the ratings informs us of that-Opposition members have discovered that if they get up and ask questions which are within Standing Orders, which seek information from the Government within the framework of the Standing Orders, the television shows a fellow looking rather gormless at the dispatch box and an answering spray from the Minister. That is what the Opposition objects to. It has discovered that that is very difficult for it to handle politically.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is a distinct qualitative difference between the way in which those opposite asked questions prior to the televising of Parliament and the way in which they now ask questions. They realise that they get one hit in Question Time and that is the question that they ask. This realisation has been manifest in two ways. The first is this absurd repetitiveness which might indeed have provoked our inquiries under standing order 146 which says that a question that has been fully answered cannot be renewed. The question that is repeatedly put to the Prime Minister or the Treasurer about when the Treasurer intends to resign is one that has been fully answered. This tactic is an attempt to get over the problem that those opposite have suddenly discovered and which they did not anticipate as a result of televising Parliament and that is that in Question Time, the Opposition does not get an argument across because the Standing Orders prohibit it. It has decided that repeatedly asking the same question is one mode of dealing with that problem.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other mode of dealing with this problem is for Opposition members to introduce for the first time a substantial amount of argument in the questions that they put forward. Therefore those opposite have placed the Speaker in this position: is the Speaker going to uphold Standing Orders against this new tactic or is he not? If the Speaker does not, then he is placed in the invidious position that he cannot stand close to Standing Orders as he deals with the business of this Parliament. That is not a position any Speaker can be placed in, whether it be a Speaker drawn from the Government ranks or one drawn from the Opposition ranks. No Speaker can handle that.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is an absolute obligation on the Opposition. If its members object to the Standing Orders, they should not wander into the House, as the former Leader of the Opposition did, and say that the Speaker has to `introduce a general atmosphere of balance, irrespective of the Standing Orders'-a general atmosphere of fairness and love for the dear old Opposition.

Absolutely essential to lifting the standards of Parliament, central to it, is the televising of Question Time'. `Unless the Government agrees to televise Question Time' says the decent, ingenuous Opposition, `we cannot possibly have an uplifting of standards in this place'. The behaviour of the Opposition since the televising of Parliament during Question Time began has been noted further afield than simply this chamber. The total ineffectualness of the Leader of the Opposition in the way he has handled his front bench, sitting through this process of total disorderliness on the part of his front bench and his back bench--

        —Like a moo-cow watching the passing traffic-totally gormless, totally unfamiliar with what is going on around him, totally reliant on the only parliamentarian in this place as far as the Opposition is concerned, the honourable member for Bennelong, who in this case is using his parliamentary skills to argue the parameters of the debate well beyond its central features. He will not get away with that; nor will the frustrated, embittered, deeply disturbed honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). He has smarted in this place because he is no longer in a position to dominate it with the same patronising, arrogant attitude we would watch on the box day after day in Senate Question Time when he was Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. The President, not enjoying a majority of senators prepared to support orderliness, was obliged to put up with this, but it is something this chamber does not have to put up with.

       This motion is clearly out of order-just as it was ruled out of order. The Opposition is smarting about this. Opposition members get up here and make their speeches about this subject, but are they sensitive when they get it straight back the same way.

Yesterday was the eighth anniversary of the election to office of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the handing over to him of the keys of the Lodge and the installation of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in that portfolio.

         —Of course they did not, because what a parlous state we find the Australian economy in today. Eight years later it is timely to review the state of our economy and to do so, as I will, within the context of the Prime Minister's 12 March statement next week and the Treasurer's response, a response which is to the recession and which, I am sure, will be announced with much fanfare.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Before I go through my contribution today and canvass some of the issues, some of the alternative policy prescriptions that ought to be adopted, let me say that if the Government does adopt them, it will have our wholehearted support.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before proceeding, let me also declare two articles of faith. First, I am a great optimist about the future of this country. This country has a fantastic future and no-one should ever put that fact to one side. Beyond the doom and gloom of Labor's recession, I believe that Australia can repay its debts, that young Australians can go to university and look forward to having a job, and that in the future Australia can run an economy where families' living standards rise, rather than fall. But it will take a massive national effort over a number of years to turn around this country. That is why we say: let us make a start on that process of readjustment now; let us not wait two years, until we are re-elected at the next election; why do we not make a start now?
       </para>
       <para>
        The second declaration of faith that I present to the House is really in response to a question that people rightfully ask. They ask whether Australia will have a manufacturing industry in the year 2000. My answer is an unequivocal yes. Australians are good at sport, medical research, literature; I believe they can be good at manufacturing as well. But I believe that a lot needs to be done if we are to achieve that objective and arrest Labor's brick-by-brick destruction of Australian manufacturing.
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been a lot of leaks already about what will be in the 12 March statement and the Delphic oracles have gathered to examine the entrails of next week's statement. I suppose it would not be unfair to say that many of them have already found them to be lacking. In fact, the high priests are preparing their lines already for the burial soon after. Ross Gittins said this morning that it is like watching somebody dying: you know they are going to die and you know that you are helpless to help them. I thought Terry McCrann put it rather well when he said, `When you are listening to it next week it will be like listening to Baghdad radio'. So might people be somewhat cynical about what they expect from the statement next week. I suppose, after we have had eight years of the world's greatest environment statement and the greatest statement on this and that, we understand people's cynicism about this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        But needless to say there is still out there in the community a great yearning for some real action to address this country's economic problems. The community really does want to see someone show some leadership and show us how we are going to get out of this mess. I suppose it was rather well stated recently by Toby Daniels, Managing Director of Tubemakers of Australia Ltd, who said:
       </para>
       <para>
        What we need is a leadership agenda. We need an element of vision about where we need to go and we need it from the top.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dr Michael Deeley, Managing Director of ICI Australia Ltd, in an excellent speech which I would recommend to people, said that the statement was:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the Government's last major shot at getting the economy right.
       </para>
       <para>
        He said that he was looking for:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . not more words, not more philosophy, not rhetoric. Indications of actions. It is time for action.
       </para>
       <para>
        How right he is. This country can afford no longer to wait. I say sincerely to the Government on behalf of all those out there who have lost their jobs, struggling on the farms and who are in that statistic of a 60 per cent increase in bankruptcies in the last 12 years, as I myself feel, `I hope next week you get it right', because this country can no longer afford to have the policy inaction, the paralysis, that appears to have gripped this Government in the face of the recession that the Treasurer said that we had to have.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me appeal to the Government's political self-interest. The Government ought to move in a radical and fundamental way to shift policy because it is the only thing that will save them politically.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I look at that statement, I think it ought to have four basic components. First, let us have a realistic assessment of our current economic circumstances. Secondly, there ought to be a summary from the Government as to both the domestic and international economic outlook. Thirdly, the Government ought to spell out its medium term objectives for this economy. Fourthly, the policies needed to achieve those objectives should be adopted and we ought to have a program of implementation for them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me now just briefly examine some of those component parts. That starting point is very important, because we have not really had from this Government a realistic assessment of where we are at. It is like pulling teeth to get from this Government a fair statement. If one talks to most people outside Canberra, and even perhaps some people in the Cabinet like the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), they understand that this Government is wrong when it says that the economy is about to turn around. In fact, since we have come back this year, much of the data that we have been confronted with has been evidence of a further deterioration in the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose the most obvious is today's balance of payments figure-$1.6m-which is a massive accumulation to our debt. Coming on top of a figure released the other day, our gross foreign debt is now $131 billion. Our country has got more debt than the combined debt of places like the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. This Treasurer himself said five years ago-I can hear the antique clocks ticking away-that if we do not grasp this problem, meet this problem of a current account deficit, then we will be a banana republic. Where is the Treasurer now to stand and defend that statement he made five years ago? Where is this set of objectives and policies to deal with this massive current account deficit problem?
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at some of the other data we have had. The Treasurer says that investment is strong, but the day before we saw the worst quarter since 1979-a drop of 11 per cent. The Treasurer says that fiscal policy is crucial to our debt stabilisation task, yet we all know that the deficit is fast approaching us, that the surplus has literally disappeared in front of his very eyes, as has the Treasurer's credibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us take unemployment. The Treasurer says that unemployment in 1991-92 is different to unemployment in 1982-83. Unemployment in this country is 8.4 per cent and rocketing up by about 1,000 people a day. Just to look further into the future, the Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd job advertisements in February showed an 11 per cent drop. Those figures have dropped 67 per cent since their peak in April 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer has got the cheek to stand here and say that corporate profits are strong, yet on the very same day we have the statistics out showing that manufacturing profits dropped a whopping 43 per cent. Lastly, as an example or consequence of that, bankruptcies are up 56.8 per cent in the year to December. The Treasurer says one thing; the reality is another.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, when looking at the data, the Government ought to look at the international situation, because I do not think that this Government has yet factored into the equation the recession in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand and elsewhere. That is the second wave. On top of that for us, of course, is not a rural recession but basically a rural depression. The second wave effects of that are yet to hit this economy, and that is why we say that a realistic assessment is one of a rolling recession through this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once we have got a realistic assessment of what our problems are, obviously the Government ought to proceed-and we urge them to proceed in the 12 March statement-with a set of medium term objectives. We ought to have clear national objectives, firstly, to stop adding to our debt and start repaying it over a period of time; secondly, to lower inflation which robs pensioners of their savings and intrudes into the economy one of the great uncertainties that undermines our investment effort; and, thirdly, to boost productivity to international standards so that eventually we can start to trade our way out of our problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        What are the Government's objectives in the face of this crisis? Who knows what its objectives are. Look at the blank stares on the back bench and the front bench, when we have a front bench which is sufficiently interested in this debate to be here. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) daydreams, thinking about leadership. The Prime Minister's expression tells it all. What is that? He is secure in the Lodge until the next election.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government has simply been changing its objectives like it changes Italian suits. One day it is the current account deficit and the next day it is inflation. What will it be next week? We need a clear set of objectives. The Government ought to take the 12 March statement as an opportunity to introduce those objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        The statement then ought to move on so that we have an identification of the problems, an identification of where this economy is likely to go and the impacts on it in the future. We have got a set of objectives. We then ought to move onto some policies that will meet those objectives so we can start to turn this economy around. First, we need the introduction of more stable medium term monetary policies to reduce and ultimately eliminate inflation. Lower inflation is critical to raising savings, reducing the real cost of capital to businesses, achieving a more realistic exchange rate and switching the incentive towards productive rather than speculative investment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, national savings must be increased through repairing the current erosion of public sector finances and incentives to private sector saving. The Treasurer ought to come in here and, instead of the personal abuse which so typifies most of his contributions to this debate, provide us with an indication of how the public sector will be restored to surplus from its current position of deficit in excess of 1 1/2 per cent of the public sector borrowing requirement. He ought to spell out what that means for Commonwealth Budget expenditures and taxation levels.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, the Government must detail a believable program to accelerate the deadly slow progress in micro-economic reform. That would include some privatisation, some plans for contracting out of government services and a detailed plan of action to meet the need for accelerated reform of our wharves, transport systems and other vital infrastructure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fourthly, we should have announced a phased program for reducing protection against imported goods, including plans for reducing protection for the motor vehicle, clothing, footwear and textile industries. Fifthly, we need an industrial relations system built around the settlement of wages and conditions in the workplace so that pay and performance are more closely linked. We ought to have a system, after we have scrapped the accord, where voters have a right to have a secret ballot before strikes. Employers and employees ought to have the right to enter into voluntary employment agreements so that they can secure tenure of the positions they now hold. Sixthly, we ought to see drawn up and then adhered to some environmental policies and assessment procedures which provide an appropriate balance between development and conservation and minimise uncertainty. The main requirements are defined-certain processes involving minimum time, not subject to reopening at a later date or to disputes between governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The opportunity in the 12 March statement ought to be grasped with both hands by this Government. It ought to be realistic. It ought to set some medium term objectives. It ought to give us the policies. The Government really needs in place the personnel who have an understanding of the magnitude of the problem and the urgency of the task in front of us so that those policies can proceed to be implemented.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a useful message for the Government in today's Sydney Morning Herald about the contents of the forthcoming statement. The statement ought to be substantial. It ought to address Australia's basic problems. Let me provide the Prime Minister with this extract from the Sydney Morning Herald:

         —I could not believe the comments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) when he raised this matter of public importance. Everybody in this House knows that this is just another ploy by members of the Opposition to try to get ideas for themselves because they have none on their own side. They are totally bereft of them. They want the Government to declare before 12 March what it is going to put in its industry statement. I urge the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to be patient. All will come to him on Tuesday, 12 March, when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) makes his industry statement, backed up by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins).
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        While I can understand the desperation of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, given the lack of ability to formulate policy on his side of the House, this matter of public importance seeks to mislead the public into thinking that the industry statement is in some way a Government response to Opposition concerns. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is entirely an initiative of the Government and has nothing whatsoever to do with the Opposition. Suffice it to say that the Government's statement on Tuesday will be appropriate to the requirements of the slowing economy and will sensibly and sensitively address the difficulties encountered by industry at this time within the context of Australia's future needs.
       </para>
       <para>
        One could not make any such prediction about the ability of the Opposition to respond in an appropriate manner.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government has consistently reduced government expenditure over the past seven years and there is no fat left to trim. Opposition proposals to slash $3 billion would have to concentrate on the sensitive and necessarily expensive areas of social security, health and education. Who would it target with its cuts? The old? The sick? The disabled? The young? The unemployed? Families with children? Students striving to gain an education? One thing we can be sure of is that the cuts would hurt those most in need and those least able to fight back. Because the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is one of those least able to fight back, I suspect that the cuts would never come to anything at all. That is something we have been led to expect from the Opposition, and I believe it can deliver nothing it promises to the electorate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although unemployment has increased recently, it has not reached the levels it did under the Liberal-National Party Government in the early 1980s. The participation rate is still very high and there is no significant level of hidden unemployment because registration with the Commonwealth Employment Service is a prerequisite to entry into most training courses. Even now access to education and training and receipt of associated income support helps to provide a buffer for people who are unemployed but who want to improve their chances of obtaining work in the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a consequence of the Government's attention to education and training there is now more likelihood that courses undertaken will yield certification that has some recognition and standing with employers, with the community and with other educational organisations. Furthermore, people who are having employment difficulties but for whom retraining is not an option at least have the security of knowing that they and their families are protected by a fair and equitable welfare system. This may not be much comfort to someone who has lost a job but it is a vast improvement on anything the Opposition would introduce or oversee, given its tendency to privatise welfare and attempt to wash its hands of income support for Australians in need. It would return us to the Dickensian times of soup kitchens and welfare handouts-to the deserving poor alone.

        When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke he had the cheek to talk about the reduction of the Budget surplus in the present economic circumstances. I cannot believe that he could have the hide even to comment when the coalition government never achieved a surplus during the entire time it was in office. Tax reform also rolls easily off his tongue and off the tongues of Opposition members in the context of the industry statement, difficulties facing industry and addressing the needs of small business. The Opposition in government never achieved any tax reform during its period in office. It has been up to this Government to address these needs, and address them it has. It will continue to do so in an appropriate manner for industry, for the economy and for the people of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the Opposition's propensity to dodge responsibility for income security issues, I certainly would not trust them to maintain a system of payments for people who are unemployed or otherwise in need of income support from government, or for sustenance, for that matter; neither does the Opposition have the confidence of industry in terms of its so-called policy positions-that is, any of them. I do not believe that industry welcomes the introduction of a consumption tax-a tax on spending. At a time when the economy requires sensitive handling the Opposition is still talking about policy positions that have both an inflationary impact in the cost sense and a contractionary impact in terms of people's tendency to spend their money on Australian produced goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition still has not learned the elementary lessons from its previous term in government. This is a classic recipe for another case of stagflation. Everyone remembers that the Liberal-National Party coalition, when last in government, managed to produce stagflation in the Australian economy. It is a complex condition which is difficult to induce and to cure. The coalition induced it, and this Government had to cure it. Double digit unemployment, double digit inflation and an economy racing into recession-that is what the Opposition gave to us when it was in government. A nightmare was produced when the Opposition's economically illiterate policies were last tried, and it would have us do it all over again. It has learned nothing from that experience, and it still mouths the same platitudes without thinking through the consequences of its prescriptions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his contribution, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition indicated that there should be a policy to bring inflation down. Inflation is coming down; has he not noticed? It is a normal response to a contraction in the economy, and it may also have side effects which are unpleasant. But certainly inflation is coming down. In short, as usual, the Opposition is wrong.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fortunately, industry almost universally recognises that the Government is now, just as it has been in the past, much better equipped than the Opposition to deal with its problems. For instance, through its positive approach to consultation with industry and unions, this Government has delivered industrial relations stability and wage certainties to companies in this country. The Opposition's prescription would yield industrial confrontation and wages chaos-and that is all we can be sure it would yield.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition is an absolute disgrace. It lacks a coherent position on anything. Industry policy is no exception. The Leader of the Opposition shoots from the hip, or the lip, on important questions of policy, or lack of policy, as the case may be-it is very seldom really policy-irrespective of the expectations of his audience that he will have properly considered his own and his Party's position.
       </para>
       <para>
        One can only pity his shadow Ministers who find themselves looking down the barrel of a policy-on-the-run gun which undercuts the positions that they themselves are still attempting to develop. They are then forced to discuss ideas publicly which they had not previously been privy to or even considered; the voucher system is one case to boot, as is the soup kitchen welfare idea.
       </para>
       <para>
        No amount of protestation from the Opposition can hide the fact that it was singularly unsuccessful in achieving any micro-economic reforms during its extensive period in office prior to 1983. As the Treasurer mentioned in Question Time, 22 years it had and it did nothing. It is easy for the Opposition to sit on the other side of the House and tell the Government what it should do on micro-economic reform when the Opposition itself was totally incapable of achieving it.

        The Opposition laughs at suggestions of micro-economic reform being achieved and demands speed in effecting such change.

Reforms are made through concentrated endeavour and consultation with the people at the coal face-the employers, the employees and their representatives, the unions. Nothing substantial or lasting will occur unless these groups agree on a process and a timetable for achieving the improvements required.

        For instance, land transport and rail reform are essential areas on which the Government has made a commitment. The Industry Commission's analysis of road transport suggests that the value to the Australian economy of reform of road transport alone is worth $1.2 billion a year. The reform of areas such as coastal shipping are actually worth considerably less than that. But if we include rail, we add another $4 billion to that area because there is considerable inefficiency in the rail system.

        Whilst I felt sorry for my colleague the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) when he was speaking in Question Time about the consequences of some of that reform in the context of reductions in employment, I think that is an inevitable consequence of the things that have to be done. It is also an indication that the Government is not afraid to make hard decisions to achieve improvements in productivity. The Minister at the table (Mr Robert Brown) understands these matters very well.

        I do not believe that the industry welcomes any of the suggestions made by the Opposition in terms of its policy prescriptions. I do not think the country can afford to have an Opposition which is so appallingly badly represented in terms of people who wish to discuss in a constructive manner change that needs to be made in the economy and in industry generally. I think that the Government has taken the proper approach to all of these matters and will certainly continue to look after industry in this country.

         —Ever since Captain Cook sailed into this country, it is doubtful whether there has been a more incompetent Government in charge of Australia's economic policy. We desperately need a new direction in this country, and we need a new direction to be announced in the 12 March statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to be delivered next Tuesday.

        There is an economic tragedy taking place in Australia today. It is a tragedy that is largely unnecessary, and the magnitude of its destruction is even greater than what we witnessed back in the Gough Whitlam days in the early 1970s. It is the result of the most incompetent and arrogant Treasurer that this country has ever seen. We are witnessing today in Australia the results of that incompetence, and it is causing major heartache for business, major heartache for workers who are being laid off and for every other citizen in this country. I would go further and say that the results which are turning up from its policies are also causing it and the Australian Labor Party major embarrassment.

        Everything that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has ever said or predicted almost inevitably has turned out to be wrong. We told the Treasurer and the Government that if they continued this insane one dimensional high interest rate policy, we would have a recession in this country. The Treasurer of course said that we were wrong. But when the recession arrived to prove that he was wrong, what did he do? He then came out and said that this is the recession `we had to have'.

But we are now in the situation today where we have `the mother of all recessions' caused by the Treasurer, who has done to Australia virtually what Saddam Hussein has tried to do to Kuwait. Hardly a week goes by in Australia today without another one of the Treasurer's predictions being proved wrong. They have been proved wrong week after week, month after month with interest rates; week after week, month after month with inflation; and even in this last week, we have had the Budget surplus plunging from a figure that he said would be over $8 billion down to something that will undoubtedly end up in a deficit. We should cast our minds back to what he told the Premiers only a few months ago in June of last year. He said:

        We should look at investment figures. The December quarterly figures are out. They are the worst for over a decade. The retail sales figures have come out. They are the worst for 25 years. Bankruptcies in this country are up 57 per cent over the last year and they are still rising, and rising rapidly. Net overseas debt has just gone up to $131 billion and is still rising-five times the level it was when the Treasurer took over. He is so loose with the truth. We heard that in Question Time today when he tried to say it was no worse than when we were last in government.

I direct that at the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), who I believe was born there. Wherever there is a Labor government in this country it is a hopeless situation. They just cannot handle money. They cannot run countries. They can do all right for two or three years, muddle their way through an election or two, but their inheritance of the previous conservative government's achievements is finally used up and they bankrupt the country.

        We badly need a change of direction in this country. It should come out of the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) next Tuesday. One of the main areas that needs to be looked at is taxation. Since the Government has been in office we have had nothing but more tax. We have seen the introduction of the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax, the wholesale sales tax has increased two or three times, personal income tax has gone through the roof, and the fuel excise has increased fourfold, from 6c a litre to 24c a litre. We have seen the luxury car tax. For heaven's sake, if there was ever a more insane tax than that I have yet to hear of it. The Government is now collecting less money from the sale of luxury cars, and caryards are shutting down around the country. All this Government has managed to do is penalise the worker and reward the indolent.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Government's last desperate move in the taxation area, apparently next Tuesday there will be some announcement that it will exempt the wholesale sales tax component of business inputs. Have honourable members ever heard anything like it? It is a steal from part of our goods and services tax policy. We are delighted to see that, of course-but why does the Treasurer not have the guts to embrace our policy fully? He knows that a goods and services tax is what this country desperately needs. He knows it in his heart of hearts. All members of the Government know it but they do not have the guts to do the right thing by Australia. Waterfront reform is another classic area.

What did we get from the honourable member for Parkes as far as a new direction is concerned? We had a rehash of the National Party's environment policy-if it sways in the breeze, chop it down; if it moves, shoot it. That is the sort of mentality we have seen expressed for decades in the National Party's environment policy. It is the sort of record that the Queensland National Party in government had and it is what the Opposition wants to go back to.

        The Australian community has learnt a bit over the years. I do not think it will cop that sort of approach.

        Then we come to the question of what we should do in the taxation policy area. The Liberal Party and the National Party have some great ideas about taxation policy. One of the best is probably that put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in an article in the National Australia Bank bulletin a couple of weeks ago. He was asked, amongst other things, whether his policies involved a shift towards consumption tax and other changes to the income tax base, including the possibility of a flat rate of personal income tax. He was also asked what this approach means for company tax under a Hewson government. The answer was:
       </para>
       <para>
        We haven't released the details. There's nothing new there. There's no details of any of the policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        But if you accept the strategy that you're moving towards a tax on expenditure rather than on incomes then there is the question of whether company tax might be phased out entirely.
       </para>
       <para>
        Is that not a wonderful suggestion? The Opposition is saying, `We'll phase out company tax entirely; we'll introduce a goods and services tax'. Who will pay for it under that sort of approach? As the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) said earlier, the people who will pay for this are the poor, the disadvantaged, the pensioners, the people who have the greatest need. That is the sort of approach we are being asked to suggest should be the new direction that is followed in the statement next Tuesday. That is something that should be rejected outright.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition say how important it is to tackle inflation. At the same time we are going to have an anti-inflation strategy-it is one of the themes that the Opposition says it is interested in-it is going to introduce the goods and services tax. The very thing that could be the most inflationary form of taxation to introduce at this time will be part of the Opposition's anti-inflation strategy.

        If we accept the scrapping of the company tax and also the introduction of the goods and services tax, what other sorts of policy directions would the Liberals suggest that we should follow? They have some beauties. They are going to have vouchers for health care, vouchers for education services. They will not worry about the people who have been disadvantaged and those whom the Liberals in government have ignored-the people who could not complete an education, who could not get proper health care. They will go back to the Dark Ages. The ones they will help are the ones who can pay for it.

       <para>
        We have the classic case of the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) who made the comment that the Liberals would introduce a policy that would mean that people are only going to be worse off if it is through their own choice. If they choose to be worse off, then that is okay. What sort of policy is that? We will have the same situation that we had before the last election. Because the Liberals would not flesh out the detail and because they could not develop proper policy guidelines, they went to the election without a health policy. The Australian Labor Party had a health policy based on the Medicare system which the majority of people clearly identified with and supported. What do the Liberals suggest as an alternative? They might have vouchers; they might have something else. One thing we know is that they just cannot come up with hard, cohesive policies. People are starting to talk about the fact that the Liberals do not have clear, cohesive policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Leader of the Opposition is the great floater of ideas. He floats the ideas but as soon as a bit of pressure is placed on him to flesh out the details of those, he sinks; the floater sinks. That is what happens to him. The Leader of the Opposition sinks on all these issues: he floats the idea about scrapping the company taxation; he floats the idea about changes that might occur in some other areas of policy relating to the goods and services tax rates or what that might mean in terms of government outlays or impacts on government outlays; he floats the idea on what he might do about capital gains tax-something that the Liberal Party has always hated. It does not believe in such things; that is a tax on people whom it has to look after.

        The question that we come back to is this: Malcolm Fraser came along in 1975 and he was going to fix up inflation; he was going to fix up unemployment; he was going to have the benefit of having the honourable member for Bennelong to do all these things for him. Unfortunately, if we look at the situation in 1975, and then at what occurred in 1983, on almost all the indicators the situation was dramatically worse in 1983. So the track record of the Opposition in eight years in government was abysmal and appalling. There was no decency at all in what it achieved on the economic front.

       <para>
        Yet we still have the honourable member for Bennelong dictating the tactics for the Opposition. Today it is not the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who take whatever spurious points might be taken at Question Time. They have to rely on the honourable member for Bennelong thinking on his feet on their behalf. They are not capable of doing that; they are not capable of developing policies; they are not capable of thinking quickly. As far as they are concerned, they have to rely on the failed discredited Treasurer of the past to provide policy direction for the future. That is a pretty sad state of affairs because, as I said before, the Opposition's record as at 1983 was abysmal.

         —Yes, that is not one of its stronger suits, that is for sure. We are faced with the situation today where, sadly, there is a considerable amount of concern in the community, quite rightly, about the economic difficulties we have. That concern is shared and appreciated by the Government, as it should be. The statement to be delivered next Tuesday night will quite rightly go to the very heart of those issues, both in the short and longer term.

         —Yes, we have a much better football team. But the truth is that in 1983 the level of unemployment, particularly amongst young people in my electorate, was more than 30 per cent. At the same time, participation rates in schools were abysmal. Only 33 per cent, or less in many cases, of young people completed schooling and a great part of that was because of the deliberate policies of that time of the Fraser-Howard Government. Compare that situation with that existing today where we have high rates of work force participation. We have historically record high rates of students completing secondary school and we also have people going on to complete skills training and higher education, something which in 1983 would have been unheard of in the sorts of numbers we have today.

        So the Government has developed policies. It will continue to develop policies. It will ensure that the statement on 12 March does not need to have in it-as was suggested-some sort of U-turn or some sort of new horizon. The Government needs consistency, coherence, sensitivity and the strength of purpose and the courage to see the job through and to create a better Australia for all those who live here.

       Just briefly in support of that proposition, I indicate that the provisions of section 12 of the Public Works Committee Act prevent the Committee from meeting when either House is sitting, except by leave of the House. The proposal before the House has arisen because the Committee has a longstanding tradition of meeting before the House sits on Thursday mornings. The recent move for the House to sit at 9.30 instead of 10 o'clock on Thursday mornings has meant that sometimes Committee meetings have had to be completed earlier than would have been the case previously.

        That the Bill be now read a second time.
       </para>
       <para>
        The purposes of the Bill are to remove from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 the exemption for superannuation and replace it with more limited exemptions, to insert in the Sex Discrimination Act a number of exemptions for certain Commonwealth and Territory legislation which is presently exempted by regulations, and to amend the Marriage Act 1961 and the War Gratuity Act 1945 so as to remove inconsistencies with the Sex Discrimination Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The process which led to the first set of amendments in the Bill, dealing with superannuation, dates back to the report by the then Human Rights Commission titled Superannuation and Insurance and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 Part 1-Superannuation. That report was prepared in response to a request by the then Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, and was tabled in Parliament on 25 November 1986. The report was considered by the Government and it was decided that the exemption be removed and that certain more limited exemptions for particular practices in superannuation be inserted into the Act. Following the Government's decision, consultations on the proposed exemptions were held with the superannuation industry, employer groups, State and Territory governments and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, as indicated in its National Agenda for Women, is committed to the objective of removing discrimination in superannuation on the grounds of sex, marital status and pregnancy. The major effect of this Bill is to remove most forms of direct discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status in superannuation practices for new schemes. Where funds are unable to comply with the new obligations under the legislation, the reasonable expectations of the members will be maintained and the discriminatory fund will be allowed to continue. However, such funds will not be entitled to admit new members. Further, members of such discriminatory schemes will generally have to be given an option to obtain non-discriminatory superannuation benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed continuing exemptions, shortly stated, deal with the following areas: the inclusion in fund conditions of a provision which is based upon actuarial data upon which it is reasonable to rely; the current practices whereby lesser death and disability benefits are provided to members who are single-that is, members who do not have a spouse or a de facto spouse-or to members who do not have a child; the possibly discriminatory effect of current vesting, preservation and portability arrangements in funds' conditions; and the protection of the existing expectations of members of discriminatory schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The introduction of the Bill was initially delayed pending the reappraisal by the Government of a proposed exemption which would have allowed funds to confine the provision of superannuation benefits to permanent and full time employees. In January 1989 the Government decided not to proceed with this exemption. Following that decision a further round of consultations on the issue was held with the superannuation industry, peak employer bodies, State governments and the National Women's Consultative Council.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill was first introduced on 11 May 1989 but lapsed when elections were called. It was then amended by the deletion of proposed section 41c, which would have permitted the remaining superannuation exemptions-that is, sections 41a and 41b-to be repealed by regulation. This provision, which was opposed by the Opposition, was not considered essential to the Bill. The Bill was reintroduced on 12 September 1990 but was withdrawn in order to make several minor technical and drafting amendments. As the regulations providing exemptions for inconsistent Commonwealth, State and Territory laws were being reviewed at the time, the Government decided to incorporate the amendments to the superannuation exemption into a more comprehensive Bill which further limits the scope of existing exemptions under the Sex Discrimination Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to a brief description of the proposed limited exemptions to be inserted in the Act. The first I wish to outline are those relating to superannuation. Because, statistically, women live longer than men, the actuarial exemption covers the resulting difference in costs of providing a pension for women. Schemes will be able to continue to offer optional conversions between lump sums and pensions which differ by sex, so long as the difference is reasonably based on reliable actuarial data. As many superannuation benefits are provided via insurance this exemption is interlinked with the insurance exemption in the Sex Discrimination Act. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has released a report on the exemption of insurance from the Sex Discrimination Act. This report is now being considered by the Government. The need for the actuarial exemption for superannuation may need to be reviewed in light of the Government's response to the Commission's recommendations concerning the insurance exemption.
       </para>
       <para>
        The exemption for certain superannuation benefits is designed to allow schemes to continue current practices, whereby upon a member's death or disability no benefits to, or in respect of, dependants are payable for a member who does not have a legal or de facto spouse or children. In the absence of this kind of exemption it may have been possible for a member who was single to succeed in a complaint of marital status discrimination. There are a number of reasons for maintaining this exemption. As the former Human Rights Commission noted in its report, the exemption reflects the community's attitude that it is appropriate to make special provision for persons who have a spouse or who have children in the event of the death or physical or mental incapacity of members of superannuation funds. As was noted by the Commission, to provide benefits to all dependants of members on proof of financial dependency would create difficulties both in administration and in finding a suitable objective test of `dependency'.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to the exemptions dealing with vesting, preservation and portability, the issue of discrimination arises because there is evidence that women statistically do not remain in continuous employment for the same length of time as men. Matters such as vesting, preservation and portability fall within the area of the operating standards for superannuation funds administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Regulations made under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 impose a number of operating standards with which superannuation funds must comply in order to be eligible for taxation concessions. These standards require all member-financed benefits and all employer-financed benefits arising from contributions made in accordance with an industrial agreement or award to vest in full in the member. They also require certain benefits, including award superannuation and personal superannuation benefits, to be preserved, generally until retirement at or after age 55.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government announced in the 1989 Budget that the introduction of vesting and preservation standards covering all employer-financed benefits will be phased in with effect from 1 July 1995. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission is engaged in the process of consulting with the superannuation industry, employers and unions for the purposes of the detailed implementation of these improved vesting and preservation standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also provides in clause 6 that section 14 of the Sex Discrimination Act is to be amended to make it unlawful for a person who exercises a discretion in relation to the payment of a superannuation benefit, in respect of a member of a superannuation fund to whom the provisions of new section 41a apply, to discriminate on the grounds of sex or marital status. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that trustees, when deciding who should receive such benefits, consider the circumstances of all the potential beneficiaries rather than making their decision purely on the basis of a person's marital status. For example, it will be unlawful not to pay a death benefit to a current de facto spouse purely because of a fund policy always to pay such benefits to the current legal spouse.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to the provisions of the Bill which are designed to protect the existing expectations of members in superannuation schemes. New section 41b will enable schemes which cannot or do not wish to comply with the requirements of new section 41a to continue to provide benefits for existing members, provided current members of these funds have the option to obtain non-discriminatory superannuation benefits. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission may, pursuant to section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act, grant an exemption from the requirement to provide an option to current members. This will enable trustees or employers to apply for an exemption where it is clear that it would not be beneficial for current members to join a new scheme or to obtain non-discriminatory benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments concerning superannuation contained in this Bill should not have an impact upon government expenditure. However, it is anticipated that all Commonwealth superannuation schemes will be amended in separate legislation to comply with the Sex Discrimination Act by the time the proposed provisions of this Bill come into effect. These further changes may affect Commonwealth expenditure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Superannuation is a very technical area of the law and the issues of discrimination which may arise may vary from case to case and industry to industry. The former Attorney-General wrote to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner requesting that guidelines be published to clarify the application of the Bill to particular situations. In addition, where trustees or employers feel that they should be exempted from the requirements proposed in this Bill, they can apply to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for an exemption under section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government believes that the amendments outlined above represent a significant reform. While I am informed that most schemes will be able to comply with the amendments with only minor adaptations to their existing conditions, the amendments will require schemes which have not yet modified their benefits to do so over the next two years, or to close off their membership. Further, the amendments are likely to increase the opportunity for part time employees to gain access to superannuation. This will significantly improve the opportunities for women to build up a worthwhile superannuation entitlement over their working lives. A large majority of part time employees are women and it is clear that women tend to return from child rearing to part time employment. Where part time employees are performing the same duties as their full time counterparts and the full time counterparts receive superannuation, it is likely that a court would find a failure to provide access to superannuation to such part time employees unlawfully discriminatory.
       </para>
       <para>
        These amendments should therefore be viewed in light of the Government's commitment to increasing superannuation coverage for the Australian work force. Arbitrated superannuation awards are providing increasing superannuation coverage. These amendments will not only encourage this development and help Australia make appropriate provision for its ageing population, but the benefits which will be offered will be fairer and more equitable and in line with the Government's commitments under the National Agenda for Women.
       </para>
       <para>
        The remainder of the amendments to be effected by this Bill concern the exemptions for inconsistent Commonwealth, State and Territory laws. The original purpose of the exemptions was to allow a period of two years from the date of commencement of the Sex Discrimination Act for the relevant governments to amend their legislation so as to remove inconsistencies with the Act. The original exemptions were due to expire on 31 July 1986 and, although the number of exemptions has decreased each year, exemptions have been continued for some legislation since then.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has expressed strong concerns about the possibility of any further renewals of the exemptions by regulation. Following consultations with the State and Territory Governments and the relevant Commonwealth departments, the Government has decided that it is inappropriate for the practice of exemption by regulation to continue. Consequently, it is proposed that the existing provisions of the Act concerning the power to extend exemptions by regulations, that is, section 40, sub- sections (2), (3) and (4), be repealed by this Bill. The current regulations expire on 31 July this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        After consulting the relevant Commonwealth departments, the Government has decided to grant indefinite exemptions under sub-section 40 (2) of the Act to a number of Commonwealth Acts. These are:
       </para>
       <para>
        Sections 4 (1) and 84 (1) of the National Health Act 1953;
       </para>
       <para>
        the Social Services Act 1980 (Norfolk Island);
       </para>
       <para>
        the Gift Duty Assessment Act 1941;
       </para>
       <para>
        the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936;
       </para>
       <para>

       </para>
       <para>

       </para>
       <para>
        the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax Assessment) Act 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        The relevant sections of the National Health Act and the Social Services Act (Norfolk Island) are discriminatory on the grounds of sex in that they mirror the discriminatory provisions that apply different ages for pension eligibility for men and women under the Federal social security scheme. The provision of an indefinite exemption for these Acts is consistent with the existing indefinite exemption provided for the Social Security Act 1947.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Income Tax Assessment Act uses a number of terms such as `relative', `associate' and `dependant' which are discriminatory on the grounds of marital status. These terms, as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act, are used in the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act and the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax Assessment) Act. As these provisions are aimed at preventing tax avoidance and the abuse of tax concessions, the desirability of indefinitely exempting this legislation is obvious.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Gift Duty Assessment Act only applies to gifts made before 1 July 1979. As most assessments have already been made, amendment of this Act is considered inappropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act uses the terms `relation' and `dependant' which are defined so as to be discriminatory on the grounds of marital status. The Act exempts from duty certain goods sent to or imported for the personal use of members of the armed forces of the United States and of Papua New Guinea or their descendants. These provisions permit Australia to comply with bilateral agreements entered into with those countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The existing exemptions under section 40 (2) are to be reinserted into the Act by new sub-section 40 (2).
       </para>
       <para>
        The regulations under the Gift Duty Assessment Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act are also to be given an indefinite exemption as provided for in new sub-section 40 (3).
       </para>
       <para>
        An exemption under new sub-section 40 (4) is to be given to student assistance schemes provided for in the Student Assistance Act 1973. The criteria for means tests and rates of payment for these student assistance schemes are discriminatory on the basis of marital status. The Government has decided to undertake a review of the discriminatory provisions of these schemes over the next three years and has limited the period of the exemption accordingly.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs are currently conducting reviews of the Defence Act and the Defence Services Homes Act respectively with a view to amending the provisions of these Acts which are inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act. Consequently, an indefinite exemption is not required for these Acts. If these Acts are not amended before the expiration of the current regulations, an administrative exemption under section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act may be sought from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.
       </para>

        Most of the inconsistent State and Territory laws covered by the regulations have either been amended to remove inconsistencies with the Sex Discrimination Act or no longer have any application. Of the inconsistent legislation which remains, the necessary exemptions may be continued, on application of the relevant government to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, by the grant of an administrative exemption under section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act. In regard to the State legislation prohibiting women being employed in lead processing, it is open to employers to apply to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for an administrative exemption. Consequently, no action is required by Parliament in respect of relevant State and Territory legislation.

        The amendments to the Marriage Act to be effected by this Bill remove the longstanding discrimination on the grounds of sex relating to minimum marriageable age. The Bill also proposes to make gender neutral two provisions of the Marriage Act concerning marriages solemnised overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the existing provisions of the Marriage Act, the marriageable age for females is 16 and the marriageable age for males is 18. The minimum age at which females and males below marriageable age can obtain court authorisation to marry a person of marriageable age is 14 and 16 respectively. The Bill provides for a common marriageable age of 18 with provision for reduction to 16 in exceptional circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provision of a common marriageable age for females and males is a worldwide tendency. There are now at least 38 countries which prescribe a common marriageable age, with 24 of these prescribing a marriageable age of 18 years. The following table shows these countries.

        In 1989 there were around 117,000 marriages in Australia. Of these, 1,052 were of females under the age of 18 years. Further, only 13 were of females under the age of 16 years and required court authorisation to marry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Law Reform Commission recently released discussion paper 46 on Multiculturalism: Family Law. The Commission set out the arguments for and against a common age of 18 years and expressed a provisional view in favour of that common age. The discussion paper was only issued after substantial, community-wide consultations, which included the ethnic communities, and its views are based on those consultations. The focus of the discussion paper is whether there should be court authorisation for marriages where a person is below 18 years and, if so, in what circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        A survey of marriage counsellors, marriage educators, court counsellors and national marriage counselling representatives was conducted by the Attorney-General's Department in 1988. Forty-seven per cent of 1,010 persons polled responded, of whom 65 per cent were of the view that 18 is an appropriate minimum marriageable age for males and 63 per cent that 18 is an appropriate minimum age for females. The Attorney-General's Department has also consulted with all other Commonwealth departments and is satisfied that there is no Commonwealth legislation other than the Marriage Act 1961 and the Family Law Act 1975 that refers to marriageable age, that there is no other Commonwealth legislation that would be affected by the proposed amendments to marriageable age, that there are no administrative arrangements that would be adversely affected and that there are no likely difficulties that might be caused in relation to any arrangements with State or Territory governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also contains transitional provisions relating to marriageable age which preserve the position of females between the ages of 14 and 18 who had commenced proceedings or given notice of intention to marry in accordance with the present law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also contains a consequential provision relating to the recognition of foreign marriages by minors where neither party is domiciled in Australia. At present the Marriage Act provides that such a marriage, that would otherwise be recognised in Australia, shall not be recognised as valid while the female party is under the age of 14 years or the male party is under the age of 16 years. Those ages are, of course, the minimum ages at which parties may presently marry with court authorisation. As the Bill raises the minimum age at which a female may marry in Australia with court authorisation to 16 years, it is consistent to apply this age to the recognition of these foreign marriages. Accordingly, the Bill provides that such a marriage shall not be recognised while either party is under 16 years of age.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill further deals with discriminatory provisions relating to the solemnisation overseas of certain marriages under our Marriage Act. These provisions are very rarely used. Section 77 imposes an additional requirement on a female non-Australian; section 78 imposes an additional requirement on a male non-Australian. The Bill renders both provisions gender neutral, but does not affect their substance.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other Act which is currently exempted by the regulations and to which the Attorney-General has not yet referred in this second reading speech is the War Gratuity Act. The War Gratuity Act provides for the payment of a gratuity to members of the Armed Forces who served in World War II and their dependants. The Act is discriminatory on the grounds of sex and marital status in that it does not recognise de facto spouses and provides differing benefits to widows and widowers. As the financial impact, if the offending provisions were to be amended, is minimal, the Government has decided to amend the Act to remove the discrimination. The amendments will in no way affect existing payments and entitlements but they will extend the ambit of the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Act is also to be amended so as to be expressed in gender neutral language. Section 5 of the Act is racially discriminatory but has been impliedly repealed by section 10 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. It was therefore in keeping with the policy of amending the War Gratuity Act to be non-discriminatory to delete section 5 from the Act. These amendments are contained in Part 4 of the Bill and its attached schedule.

        This Bill gives effect to the Government's pledge to work towards prohibiting mining in Antarctica. On 17 August 1990 the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) announced the Government's decision to introduce legislation to ban all mining in Antarctica to the extent of Australia's legal capacity to apply such a ban. This Bill achieves that objective.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will prohibit minerals activity in the Australian Antarctic Territory, and will prohibit Australian nationals and corporations from undertaking minerals activities elsewhere in the Antarctic region. The Bill is a first key step towards achieving our objective of comprehensive and legally binding protection of the Antarctic environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Antarctic environment is unique. It represents the world's greatest pristine wilderness. The processes of nature are still taking their course largely unaffected by mankind. The Antarctic is not isolated, however. It is fundamentally linked to the global environment through, for example, complex interactions in the global atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Pollutants generated elsewhere in the world are now detectable in Antarctica. The rapid growth in recent years in countries wishing to be present in Antarctica has also brought additional stresses on the environment. But these impacts are negligible compared with the potential damage that could be caused by minerals exploration and development.
       </para>
       <para>
        Antarctica is portrayed as a harsh place. But the delicate balance of life forms show that, despite Antarctica's harsh image, the environment is exquisitely beautiful and fragile. The scientific work that has been done in Antarctica over many years, in which Australians have taken a leading role, shows that Antarctica still has much to teach us. The Government firmly believes that Antarctica's extraordinary environmental and scientific values must not be put at risk. Thus Australia, together with France, Belgium and Italy, is asking the Antarctic treaty parties to agree on a means for permanently protecting Antarctica by declaring it a nature reserve and a land of science.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased to report that Australia is making progress towards its objective of securing the agreement of its Antarctic treaty partners to a new legal instrument that will achieve effective protection of Antarctica. The recent Antarctic treaty special consultative meeting in Chile saw encouraging movement towards our objectives. A significant number of countries are now supporting the thrust of our proposals.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill will assist in achieving a prohibition on all mining and related activities in Antarctica by banning mining by Australians and non-Australians alike in the Australian Antarctic Territory. This is some 42 per cent of the Antarctic continent. In addition, the legislation will prohibit Australian nationals and corporations from engaging in mining activity elsewhere in Antarctica.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill recognises the need to allow for activities in support of scientific work. The legislation is targeted at commercial minerals activity and has been drafted so as not to apply to scientific research and building and maintenance activities in support of scientific stations. The Government recognises the importance of Antarctica for scientific research and, for example, will not stand in the way of legitimate geological and geophysical research. Nor does the legislation apply to foreign nationals or corporations of countries which have enacted similar legislation. The reason for this is simple: the Government is seeking to encourage other countries to put in place similar legislation binding on their nationals. It is pleasing to see that a number of other countries have already moved in this direction.
       </para>
       <para>
        The penalties for contravention of the legislation are, in the case of an individual, a maximum of $100,000 and, for a body corporate, $500,000. Offences are indictable, although provision has been made for proceedings to be heard summarily if it is proper to do so and both the defendant and prosecutor agree. In that case, the maximum penalties are correspondingly reduced.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, the Government's stand on protection of the Antarctic environment has been strongly supported by the Australian community, and I believe this legislation will be widely welcomed. I urge the Opposition to be equally firm in its support of it.

       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill provides for a revised system to elect the Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory, to be known as the ACT Electoral System. The system is designed to overcome the inadequacies of the existing heavily modified d'Hondt system which arose out of parliamentary consideration of the Government's legislative proposals in 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's decision to introduce a new ACT electoral system arises out of its review of the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its 1989 report entitled Inquiry into the ACT Election and Electoral System. The joint standing committee's inquiry was in large part initiated by the controversy surrounding that first election and the system used to decide it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee's principal recommendation proposes that a referendum be held in the ACT to determine the preferred electoral system to be used at future ACT elections. The Government believes that the inability of the joint committee to reach agreement on a preferred system is of key significance and is witness to the disparate but firmly held views which exist. Further, any referendum result is unlikely to identify clear electorate support for any single system. Accordingly, the Government rejects the Committee's referendum proposal on the grounds that such a course is not likely to provide a definitive outcome, may not be accepted by the parties concerned and may merely serve to regenerate earlier debates on the merits of self-government. The cost of a referendum is a further but secondary factor in this decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new ACT electoral system is in large measure the system which this Government sought to establish when it introduced its electoral legislation in late 1988. The heavily modified d'Hondt system used at the first election in March 1989, including the arbitrary cut-off threshold and the complex vote counting procedures, combined with the large number of candidates who chose to stand-many on anti-self-government platforms-resulted in an election count that extended for over two months. Quite unfairly, it has been the d'Hondt system itself which has drawn the resulting wide criticism rather than the modifications to the system.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's continuing view is that the problems and criticisms surrounding that first ACT election could have been avoided had the Government's original 1986 proposal for an electoral system based on single member electorates been accepted. To have proposed that the Territory elect its representatives from single member electorates in the same manner as other mainland Australian States should not have been novel or controversial. In fact, it is this system-which has been used to elect members to many people's Houses in English speaking democracies-which was not supported.
       </para>
       <para>
        The opposition parties' objections to a system of single member electorates persist. Accordingly, in 1988 and again now, the Government, in its commitment to effective self-government for the Territory, has been forced to compromise. Facing the rejection of a system based on single member electorates, as used in other people's Houses, the Government has decided on an ACT electoral system which embodies some key elements of the d'Hondt system.
       </para>
       <para>
        This system has a high reputation. It is in common use to elect people's Houses in non-English speaking Western democracies including France, the Netherlands and Finland. The d'Hondt system is one of proportional representation, through which the electoral wishes of the people are directly reflected in the composition of their government. The system is highly regarded for its ability to deliver stable government. As I have said, it is not the d'Hondt system itself which has resulted in the current unwieldy election process, but the amendments which were made to it in the political context of the first self-government election.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill largely removes those amendments. Accordingly there will be no threshold or droop quota, no provisional election process, and no provision for voters to express preferences for party candidates other than those within the party of their choice. Indeed it is significant that the recommendations of the ACT Legislative Assembly Select Committee on Self-Government make it clear that demodification of the d'Hondt system along the lines of that now proposed would be an improvement.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the major shortcomings of the existing system, particularly in the context of the first ACT election, is the inordinate length of time needed to decide the election count. Even given that the 1989 election involved 117 candidates, the period of nine weeks required to complete the count is unacceptable. Under the new system, a staged counting process will be used with the first stage comprising a count of the votes cast for each party and independent candidates. The staged process means that a guide to the state of the parties and independents should in most circumstances be available on election night and the full count completed within two weeks. To assist the early completion of the election count, the cut-off time for the receipt of postal votes is to be set at the close of polling on election day.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has previously responded to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report Inquiry into the ACT Election and Electoral System. The Government will give effect to the commitments noted in that response through provisions contained in this Bill. Specifically, to discourage other than serious candidates, the candidate deposit is to be raised to $250. To discourage frivolous parties, all political parties other than parliamentary parties will be required to demonstrate a minimum membership of one hundred eligible ACT electors, and individuals will be prevented from being the registered officers of more than one party.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government believes that the passage of this Bill would discharge the Commonwealth's duty to the people of the ACT by providing them with an efficient and democratic electoral system. The Government believes that, following the next ACT election, the Assembly will be at a stage where it is able to conduct its own electoral affairs. Accordingly I am pleased to announce the intention of this Government to hand over to the Territory the power to control the Territory electoral system after the next election, scheduled for February 1992. I intend to bring forward legislation in the Budget sittings later this year to give effect to this commitment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Like other ACT legislation any electoral legislation of the ACT Assembly would be subject to the disallowance power of the Governor-General. No doubt those parties and independents contesting the second ACT election scheduled for 1992 will seek to declare their platform regarding the future territory electoral system.
       </para>
       <para>
        To use the words of my predecessor, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), in his second reading speech on the original Bill in 1988, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, this Parliament has a constitutional responsibility to ensure the good and stable government of this the nation's capital. This Bill achieves this by providing for the people of the Territory a simplified, democratic and efficient ACT electoral system. In presenting the Bill, I note again the Government's intention to extend to the people of the Territory in 1992 the power to control their own electoral system. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, and I commend the Bill to the House.

        —As was announced when the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill was introduced, this Bill repeals one Act, the Darwin Lands Acquisition Act 1945, and amends six Acts in that portfolio-namely, the Australian Capital Territory (SelfGovernment) Act, the Australian Sports Commission Act, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act, the National Library Act, the Audit Act, and the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. The Opposition has no problem with any of these amendments and will not oppose them. However, I would like to make a few brief comments on some sections just to illuminate some of our views.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       First, I turn to the amendment concerning the Australian Capital Territory's superannuation provisions and Territory borrowings. Clearly there had to be some amendments made for ACT Legislative Assembly members to receive their superannuation as a consequence of self-government. The idea of this amendment is to allow that superannuation provision to overcome the problem where an Assembly member is deemed to have vacated office if he or she receives any remuneration, allowance, honorarium or reward for service rendered in the Assembly. That clearly is a machinery provision which puts into the Act what already has been occurring in the past.
      </para>
      <para>
       Secondly, it removes the requirement for the approval of the Federal Treasurer for borrowings, and removes the Commonwealth's guarantee on such borrowings. Again this does not affect the Commonwealth's power under other legislation to guarantee Territory borrowings for special reasons; nor does it limit the borrowing powers of the ACT and of the Northern Territory. It obviously comes as a result of an Australian Loan Council decision to allow the States and Territories more autonomy in raising and servicing their own debt.
      </para>
      <para>
       I understand that this amendment, as it affects the Northern Territory, will in fact increase the borrowing cost for the Territory because of the removal of this guarantee. While it means that the Territory no longer has to get the Treasurer's approval, it may reduce the attractiveness of Territory bonds. I am informed that the cost to the Territory could be quite significant. For example, for Telecom Australia's non-guaranteed bonds, issued in February, the rates were some 70 to 75 points-that is, 0.7 per cent-above Telecom guaranteed stock. The fear is that this cost may in fact be translated to Northern Territory bonds.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth has suggested that withdrawing this guarantee will allow the Territory to be treated more like a State. I understand that the Territory would be much happier with this if other areas currently under Commonwealth powers were transferred to the Territory. A couple of areas that have been specifically drawn to my attention are uranium royalties and also the question of land rights. However I also understand that the Territory would be prepared to continue to seek the Federal Treasurer's approval for its borrowings if the guarantee were to be restored. I also understand that the Territory is not in favour of this amendment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second set of amendments, which comes into the portfolio of my colleague the shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), involves the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. I understand that the honourable member for Pearce would like to make special mention of the fine job done by those working for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. He has been extremely impressed by the work they have done. I believe that many other honourable members who have had the opportunity to see this work have been equally impressed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The amendment would allow any money collected by the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service from leases, licence permits and other authorities to be used by the service in its conservation role.
      </para>
      <para>
       Likewise there are a number of amendments to the Australian Sports Commission Act 1989, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 and the National Library Act 1960. The amendments will bring reports on the financial transactions of the Australian Sports Foundation under the reporting of the Audit Act. These reports were previously done voluntarily. Again the Liberal and National parties do not oppose these amendments.
      </para>
      <para>
       The amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act are only drafting amendments and the amendments to the National Library Act are of a minor technical nature to allow the library more flexibility and to bring it in line with other statutory authorities and institutions such as the Australian War Memorial and the Australian National Gallery. As has been pointed out, the Liberal and National parties do not oppose these amendments.

        —When the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill was introduced in February, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) indicated the purposes of the Bill and the essential amendments that were being introduced.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The effect of the amendments proposed for the repeal of the borrowing provisions in the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 is that the ACT and the Northern Territory governments and their statutory authorities no longer require the approval of the Commonwealth Treasurer to enter into borrowing transactions and to remove the Commonwealth guarantee of such borrowings. As the Minister indicated, this is part of the Government's program to implement last year's decision by the Loans Council that the States and Territories will gradually assume full responsibility for raising and servicing their own government debt.
      </para>
      <para>
       The explanatory memorandum and second reading speech also explained that this repeal will not affect the Commonwealth's power under present or future legislation to guarantee Territory borrowings for special reasons or to limit the borrowing powers of the two self-governing Territories. To a very large extent, of course, these amendments are of a technical nature and this legislation, as I have indicated, is simply used as a vehicle to effect those particular changes.
      </para>
      <para>
       The amendment to the Australian Sports Commission Act 1989, as the Minister indicated, will bring the Australian Sports Foundation under the reporting requirements of division 3 of part XI of the Audit Act 1901. This is consistent with the Government policy of applying provisions from either division 2 or division 3 of part XI of the Audit Act to all Commonwealth statutory authorities and their bodies corporate, such as the Australian Sports Foundation.

        —It was because the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) had not really used his full time. I intend to use mine, and I am grateful to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) for assisting me there. The Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill proposes a wide ranging series of amendments to the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Act, but I want to speak to a particular topic which is at the very core of the administration of the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, and that is a role it has taken on recently to manage World Heritage listed properties. I have in mind one in particular, and that is the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, because it is the management of that region, which is carried out jointly with the State Government, that will perhaps be the first test of how well we are to stand by our commitment to World Heritage listed areas.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Last week I travelled to the area of Tully, south-west of Cairns, with some members of the Caucus environment committee, in order to look at the Tully-Millstream hydro-electric scheme proposal. This proposal exhibits an exquisite conflict between the need for a renewable source of energy and its undoubted impact on the World Heritage listed rainforests. I say it is an exquisite conflict because most certainly we need renewable sources of energy in this country. Not only do they tend not to run down the energy capital as do coal and other sorts of energy sources, but also, by and large, the proposal provides a clean source of fuel.
      </para>
      <para>
       Nevertheless, the impact on the World Heritage listed rainforests has to be accounted for, measured and then decided upon. The Queensland Government has established a task force to look at the hydro-electric scheme across all of its many elements-that is, its environmental impact; the demand for energy in Queensland; alternative demand energy; the importance of demand management in Queensland-that is, reducing individuals' use of energy in Queensland; and so on. It has brought together a whole array of issues that are important to the future of the energy industry in Queensland, and also, as I say, to this important World Heritage listed area.
      </para>
      <para>
       I want to give my impressions of the area and the issues. The Queensland State Government and the Federal Government only recently established a joint management authority to look over the wet tropical rainforests. It seems to me that, in the public's mind, wherever an area is listed as a World Heritage area, it is probable that most people think that that is it-that we put that area aside for all time and there shall be no further interference with it. Of course, that is not so. One of the difficulties that the Federal Government will have in the next couple of years is that, wherever there is a proposal to undertake some form of industry or whatever in a World Heritage listed area, there will be the expectation that the Government will say, `No, you cannot do that, this is a World Heritage listed area'.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have to be very careful about that sort of debate. We list certain areas on the World Heritage List because of the values that obtain in that area. The critical question in this particular instance is whether the hydro-electric scheme will damage the values for which we listed the area. We do not say no just because there will be some impact; we say yes or no according to whether the values for which the area was listed will somehow be impaired.
      </para>
      <para>
       The important values for which the wet tropical rainforests were listed have been outlined. Without going into great detail, there are four major subheadings under which any area of the world may be listed. It so happens that the wet tropics were listed under each of those four areas, so obviously it is a very important area. The first value that a site must have before it is listed by the World Heritage Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation is that it must be an outstanding example representing a major stage or the major stages of the earth's evolutionary history. The second one is that it must be an outstanding example representing significant ongoing geological processes, biological evolution and man's interaction with his national environment. The third is that it must contain superlative natural phenomena, formations, features or areas of exceptional natural beauty. The fourth is that it must contain the most important and significant natural habitats where threatened species of animals or plants of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science and conservation still survive. The question is whether the Tully-Millstream hydro-electric scheme impairs each or any of those four values.
      </para>
      <para>
       To put the scheme in perspective, the World Heritage listed rainforest runs from Cooktown, to the north of Cairns, right through to Townsville. It is an extremely large area of land. I believe that in terms of rainforest it covers some 660,000 hectares. In terms of the lesser forests attached to the rainforest-that is, the wet sclerophyll forests-there are 49,000 hectares which fall within the World Heritage listed area.
      </para>
      <para>
       The major impact of this proposal for a hydro-electric scheme is the drowning of these forests. There is no greater impact than actually drowning an area. Let us get the magnitude right. The area that will be drowned-the Nitchaga dam will be one of the major reservoirs associated with the scheme-is 135 hectares of rainforest. The magnitude is important if we are to talk about impairing values-135 hectares out of 660,000 hectares will be lost as a result of one of the reservoirs associated with the scheme. There will also be 1,366 hectares of wet sclerophyll forest lost out of 49,000 of that type of forest in the area.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is absolutely important that we analyse this matter sensibly. Just because some area will be lost in a huge total World Heritage listed rainforest area does not mean to say that this scheme should not go ahead. The loss of forest through drowning is minuscule, in anyone's terms. The impact, of course, of just a straight loss through drowning can be felt in a number of ways. It can mean the loss of habitat for certain animals. There are the greenhouse implications of having that wood rot after it has drowned. There may be implications for certain plant species if those particular hectares of drowned area happen to coincide with some very rare species.
      </para>
      <para>
       So far, in the material that I have read and the observations that I have made, no habitat will be destroyed that will impact on a particular animal species to its total detriment. There will be no significant impact on any plant community. What I mean by that is that, whilst certain trees will be drowned and will be gone forever, the evolution of those trees, the habitat of the animals and the specific and rare species that abound through this entire region will not be lost. I argue therefore that the values for which the area has been listed will not be lost.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those are not the only impacts. As part of the scheme, which will in essence connect a number of sources of water and pipe them through the hydro-electric turbines in order to create 600 megawatts of energy-it really is a very significant source of renewable energy-there will be a diversion off a number of small streams of significant amounts of water. The Koolmoon stream, which sits squarely within the World Heritage listed area just north of Tully, will have significant amounts of water diverted from it. So there will be a small wall which will not cover the whole of the stream and water will be diverted constantly-wet season and dry season-through an underground tunnel so as not to disturb the general environment of trees and the connectivity of forest areas into a reservoir.
      </para>
      <para>
       The great fear is that at some periods there will be such a diversion of water that there will be an impact on the water life, the biota, further down that stream. These are the sorts of areas about which we need to be extremely sensitive. Is there to be a major impact on a particular stream within a World Heritage listed rainforest? We do not yet know, to my satisfaction, the significance of that impact. Certainly, the Queensland Electricity Commission (QEC), and other consultants as part of the task force, have sent the botanists and others into the region to study the impact of a change in water flow in this Koolmoon stream and other associated works.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have had discussions with the Australian Conservation Foundation and others on this matter. They talk in terms of the percentage of water that will be diverted from Koolmoon stream. Up to 97 per cent of the water flow will, at some stage, be diverted from Koolmoon across into a pipe. If the 97 per cent is diverted during a flood period of very high levels of rainfall-Tully has the highest rainfall in Australia-then there may be a quite significant impact because of the loss of that water further down the stream. That needs to be studied carefully. The sorts of diversions that would occur at low rainfall will be minimal. There will not be a great deal of water flowing down that creek-and I have seen this myself-and, to the extent that not a great deal of water will be diverted, presumably, there will not be a great impact further down the stream. That is a presumption and assumption we make at the moment. The Queensland Electricity Commission confirm that there will not be adverse impacts on the stream downstream from these diversions. That work needs to be completed before we are satisfied-if ever-that there will not be significant impacts on that particular stream. So there are areas in which we need to do some work.
      </para>
      <para>
       The three major arguments that the conservation movement has against the hydro-electric scheme are that Queensland does not require this new generating capacity, that Queensland in fact has produced sufficient generating capacity, mainly as a part of the gear-up to the 1980s resources boom, and that it does not need any new capacity. The Queensland Electricity Commission has given us its projections for demand management. Some independent consultants have given us their projections. The conservation movement has also done its figures and, lo and behold, the figures are significantly different. The conservation movement suggests that with clever-I stress clever-demand management over ensuing years there will not be the need or requirement for this 600 megawatts of power.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Queensland Electricity Commission and, I think, four different reports have said that with reasonable technical feasible demand management there is a need for this hydro scheme to be brought on stream by 1996-97-which is not so far away. For me, the jury is out on that question; but there is a significant weight of opinion that says that in practical terms Queensland will need this hydro scheme. I think something like 100,000 new people are coming to Queensland each year. We are a growth State. We cannot avoid that and we cannot avoid the energy requirements that come with that growing State.
      </para>
      <para>
       I know that back in 1983, over the Franklin Dam issue, the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Commission had run off a number of projections there about the energy that would be required in Tasmania into the future. The Tasmanian Wilderness Society at that time proved quite convincingly that the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Commission was far too optimistic in its projections for demand. But Tasmania, with great respect to all Tasmanians, has not been a State of any significant population growth or industry growth for many years. It simply does not compare with the sort of growth that we are finding and could reasonably expect in Queensland for the next however many decades. So I suspect that the question of demand, of the need for this hydro-electric scheme, will only be answered in the positive: that it is needed and that the demand is there and will need to be satisfied by this hydro scheme.
      </para>
      <para>
       The area where I want to support the conservationists and push the State Government very hard is that of demand management. Are the Queensland Government and the Queensland Electricity Commission thoroughly convinced of the need for demand management? Will they seriously put a great deal of effort into considering alternative means of generating capacity and ways of making people save energy? That is the big question. Again, the jury is out on that one because the task force is still deliberating; there are reports to be handed down next month.
      </para>
      <para>
       Right now the Queensland Electricity Commission states in its annual report that its major objective is to raise the price of electricity at about half the level of the consumer price index (CPI) and its second objective, which appears a little contradictory, is to reduce its own debt. The QEC has a financial capacity to divert some of its moneys to studying ways in which demand management can be imposed very firmly within Queensland and where some technically feasible alternative means of generating capacity can also be implemented quickly. That comes to the question of political will, and the conservationists are part of the movement which ought to pressure the Queensland Government, in the most proper sense, to ensure that it is fair dinkum on the question of seeking out technically feasible alternative methods of generating electricity and demand management for electricity.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second major problem the conservationists have is the environmental impact of this scheme on a World Heritage listed area. I suspect that the main reason they are worried is not because of the detailed arguments I have alluded to but because it might seem to be a crack in the wall: if we can have a hydro scheme associated with a World Heritage listed area, what can we not have? Where does one rule off the sorts of activities that are allowed in a World Heritage listed area? That matter will have to be worked out scheme by scheme. When we pushed for the listing of the wet tropical rainforests we never intended that all activity would stop.
      </para>
      <para>
       The joint management authority now has a very difficult task of working through the management of the impact of these sorts of schemes, but it should be remembered that this is a renewable source of energy. Queensland and Australia require that sort of energy. My view is that the impact is not so great. It can be handled and minimised. This scheme, excepting some quibbles and some more work, will probably succeed.

       I rise to speak as chairman of the coalition's task force on environment and development and I wish to make some comments on the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. This omnibus Bill deals in only a minor way with matters regarding the environment and conservation. However, they should not pass without comment. I shall try to limit my remarks to those parts of the Bill that deal with the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS).
      </para>
      <para>
       The coalition, as the House has already heard from the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), does not object to the amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. As the only political party in Australia to have a written environmental policy, we on the Opposition benches have always made clear our support for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. I too would like to pay tribute to all the people in the Service, who give a remarkably dedicated service around Australia and who are very generous with their time in giving advice to honourable members on both sides of the House.
      </para>
      <para>
       The coalition's environment policy recognises the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service as, and I quote from its last annual report:

       The Commonwealth's principal management and advisory body in regard to the discharge of direct Federal responsibilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       We totally support the mission of the Service, as described in the 1988-89 annual report of the ANPWS:
      </para>
      <para>
       To protect and conserve the nature conservation values of the Australian natural environment and native wildlife-

      <para>
       in cooperation with the States and Territories as appropriate and to enhance awareness of and access to the Australian natural environment.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let me remind the House what the coalition's policy has been for some time:
      </para>
      <para>
       Stress its role in providing expert advice to the Commonwealth and State Governments; in monitoring and enforcing the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act and in controlling the operations of the kangaroo monitoring unit.
      </para>
      <para>
       That policy also says:
      </para>
      <para>
       We endorse the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare regarding the control of the kangaroo industry. Improvements will be made in data collection of population numbers and dynamics and there will be adequate research into these questions. The present system of quota setting and control management will be maintained through a system of licensed shooters adequately policed by the appropriate authorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is also our policy to create an endangered species unit within the ANPWS. I mention these points because this is an occasion to remind the Parliament of the strength of the Opposition's environment policy and the total reliance we have on the continuation, development and proper recognition of this Service.
      </para>
      <para>
       In so far as the amendments in the Bill reflect increased independence of the ANPWS, we support that intention. The insertion of new subsection 46 (1) (f) into the Act, which provides that money payable to the Director of the Service from leases, licences, permits, and other authorities be now paid into the Australian national parks and wildlife fund, is a sensible amendment that has our support.
      </para>

       Obviously the autonomy of ANPWS is improved by this non-contentious amendment which, at the very least, will simplify the accounting procedure and should lead to greater autonomy of the Service. For my part, I hope this move will not mean that the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service will have to rely solely on its own fund-raising endeavours as time goes by. I can find no mention in either the Bill or the explanatory notes of the intention of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to maintain the real level of government funds to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. I raise that issue because this afternoon the Minister answered a dorothy dix question from her own side on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, saying that, despite no mention of it, the Government will maintain its funding of that fine organisation. Although I hope this is still the Government's intention with the Bill, there is no mention of it.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second environmental aspect of the Bill is again not contentious and the coalition will not oppose it. The coalition supports the new section 49A to be inserted into the Act. This amendment will allow the Director of the Service to invest funds not immediately required by the Service (a) with an approved bank; (b) in Commonwealth securities; or (c) in any other way approved by the Treasurer. This is another small improvement to the independence of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service.
      </para>
      <para>
       I notice that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), in her second reading speech, likened-only likened-this amendment to section 54A of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act which, as we heard in her answer to a question today, gives power to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. In view of that fact, one would expect ANPWS to have similar responsibilities over any funds it receives, and thus the amendment is welcome certainly on this side of the House. Again I say this small amendment may assist the ANPWS in raising funds for research projects; I hope it does.
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable members and, I suspect, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Free), who is seated at the table, may not be aware that since 1985, when the government parties set up the Australian Wildlife Fund, a non-profit company, it has helped to raise funds for the service to assist koala research and support research into endangered species. It is hoped by this side of the House that the Australian Wildlife Fund will continue its work in providing funds for research projects. It has been said, and I agree, that this amendment may also provide further funding for similar research by ANPWS. However, no mention has been made of who will be appointed to the board of governors and whether they will be appointed without financial reward, as is the case with the Australian Wildlife Fund Ltd. This is a remarkable omission by the Minister.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister has had a lead from the annual report of the National Parks and Wildlife Service for 1988-89. In that report, under the heading `Australian Wildlife Fund Limited', it states:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Wildlife Fund Limited (AWF) is a non-profit company set up in 1985 to raise funds for research projects of the ANPWS. The AWF has a board of governors who are prominent in business, community service or broadcasting and contribute their time to the Fund without financial reward.
      </para>
      <para>
       It goes on to state:
      </para>
      <para>
       As the first fund raising activity the AWF introduced an annual release of Koala Research Stamps. Although not for postage purposes, similar `cinderella' stamps--
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not quite know what that means-
      </para>
      <para>
       have proved very popular with stamp enthusiasts in North America for a number of years. A third series of Koala Research Stamps was released in February 1989.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is over two years ago, honourable members would quickly understand, but we have no further information since February 1989. We assume it went well.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report also mentions that in October 1988 $5,000 was provided to the ANPWS as the first contribution from the AWF to research funds of the ANPWS. This small section finishes by saying:
      </para>
      <para>
       While the AWF has initially concentrated on generating funds to assist koala research these efforts are now being diversified to support more general wildlife subjects and specifically endangered species.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I have mentioned, there is no identification of the members who make up the governors of the board. There is no mention in previous situations of who are the approved banks, what are the approved investment sources. A third lot can be invested into things that are approved of by the Treasurer.
      </para>
      <para>
       This tends to be going against the argument that I have been putting, that we are giving the ANPWS added autonomy. Its own last annual service report available to us gives no lead as to what funds it may deal in. It gives no indication as to just who are the people who are making what we hope will be substantial decisions. As I have said before, there is no mention at all about what the Government plans to do with continuing to provide funds for the service.
      </para>
      <para>
       So, despite this, I personally support these two amendments in the bipartisan manner which the coalition follows and adopts in regard to matters concerning environment and conservation. My great problem is that nowhere near enough time is given in this Parliament and certainly not in this House or-as the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) referred to it this morning-chamber. We do not have the opportunity to speak anywhere near long enough on environmental matters. It is a tragedy that the Tully Falls, being the subject of the speech given by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns)-an area of North Queensland which is much more vital than the average person living in the south of Australia believes-has not been discussed in this House at all until that honourable member raised it this afternoon in what has been allowed to be a wide ranging debate on this Bill.
      </para>
      <para>
       The coalition is committed to the objective of sustainable development and we have developed clear detailed policies with that objective in mind. We have never shirked our responsibility in this area, and we have always supported the present Government when it has made a correct decision. Sadly again, those correct decisions have been far too few. I would say to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories that, when the Government makes correct decisions, those decisions will be supported, as in this instance. However, the coalition will continue to use Parliament as the proper and effective forum for debates on environmental matters.
      </para>
      <para>
       En passant, in view of the contempt with which this Government treats this Parliament and its reluctance to initiate parliamentary debate on the environment, it is remarkable that the legislation today gives no indication as to who will control the Australian Parks and Wildlife Fund. It does not even say whether this is to replace the Australian Wildlife Fund Ltd. One suspects that it will, but there is not a word from the Minister who prepared the papers for the Parliament today. It is really too careless of the Minister to have kept this information to herself, if in fact she has it.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was going to conclude my remarks by reiterating the coalition's support for the two amendments to which I have addressed my remarks today. I assure the Minister that the coalition is proud of its own record of achievement in the area of the environment, and we shall continue to press for sustained debate on conservation matters within this Parliament without heat, without rancour and without prejudice. However, in view of the wide ranging nature of the debate, I thought I would just mention one small point which is not strictly within the confines of the Bill. It relates to the interjection made by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), not earlier today but later today when the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill second reading speech was being read to the House. The Minister, who had had the speech written for her, obviously said that she hopes the Opposition will follow the lead that she has given.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a member of the former parliamentary environment committee in the last Parliament and as one of those Liberals who were responsible for the Opposition leading the Federal Parliament on the need and on the policy of no mining in the Antarctic, and having been congratulated by the then Chairman and my friend now, Mr Peter Milton, I do believe the Minister should be aware of these facts, as should those who write her speeches. I shall have more to say on this when the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Bill comes before the House for further debate. In the meantime, Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to speak on a wide range of subjects in this Bill.

        —While the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill refers to a number of the Acts which come within the responsibilities of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), I intend to restrict my remarks to two aspects of the Minister's portfolio-the first relating to the sporting area and the second to heritage.

       It is probably very easy to play politics on the issue of sport because of the excellent record that this Government has, but I want to give credit to the previous Government, the Fraser Government, for the initiatives that it took in establishing the Australian Sports Commission, as it was, and setting up the Australian Institute of Sport. In saying that, I think the credit ought to go to this Parliament. Irrespective of who was in power at the time, the records show that there was strong and widespread support for greater emphasis being given to sport in this nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since the Fraser years the Hawke Labor Government has continued with the promotion of sports development and sports participation to ensure that it was community wide and to ensure that it picked up those who, we might say, are the disabled and minority groups. It has given a special emphasis to the elite aspect of sport, particularly elite coaching. During this period of government we have seen inquiries into drugs in sport. There has been a new emphasis on sports medicine and sports science. There has been a recognition by this Government and by the previous Government, and also certainly by the Whitlam Government, that there is a demand within the Australian community for governments to play their part in the provision of those facilities and resources to promote sport.

        —I will explain why. I really think it has come from community demand. There has been a demand coming from every level of the community. This has been seen with the aged. People have lived longer and have stayed more active. As we seem to have combated infirmity, at least to a significant degree, there are those who wish to maintain their participation in all sorts of recreational pursuits. There has been a recognition also that there are economic advantages-I will go to those issues in a moment-from simply a health aspect, from the preventative and curative aspects, of sport and recreation. Doctors have become deeply involved in sport, not just because of the dollars that they might gain in sports medicine but because they see the preventative aspect as well.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       We have seen a growth in the importance of sport politically and also within the community. We have seen an increased amount of money being spent on resources and facilities. This has achieved better sporting performances. It has achieved improved coaching standards. There are those special international achievements that one might read about in the latest annual report of the Australian Sports Commission. It highlights those page after page, particularly centred around the Olympic Games. It mentions the Australian teams who have participated in the Commonwealth Games and other international sporting events.
      </para>
      <para>
       I mentioned earlier that sport is economically important. Today it is truly an industry. The economic significance flows not only to the national level but is experienced at the regional and local levels, be it in equipment sales, the provision of facilities, the employment that is created or the health issue that I talked about before. It even flows to the media and printing industries. A massive amount of money is spent today on the production of material.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the latest report that the Minister for Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Ms Fatin) has distributed to honourable members, outlining the sort of assistance that is given under the recreation and fitness program, there is page after page listing the publications, videos, manuals, posters and all sorts of material available to Australians. One can imagine the costs involved in this production level. Again, sport and recreation is vital in that field.
      </para>
      <para>
       We could add the travel industry to the importance of sport economically. I do not know what percentage of the income earned by the travel industry relates directly to sport but I would suggest a large proportion is linked up directly and indirectly with sport and recreation across this nation. It is important that governments, regardless of their political colour, recognise this and are prepared to give not only policy attention to the issues but also resources in terms of dollars.
      </para>
      <para>
       The issue that I want to raise is that it seems that whilst the emphasis has been national-there are certainly runs on the board when it comes to achievement in sport and we have certainly achieved our objectives set down in the report, the objectives of significantly improving Australia's sporting performance and promoting widespread community participation in sport, and providing the resources and the services and facilities-I am concerned that the emphasis is placed too much on where the population is. I speak as a member of parliament representing a provincial city and a large rural area.
      </para>
      <para>
       I want to talk about talent identification. This is a subject that concerns all members who represent those areas where young people particularly do not get the opportunity that they deserve. Some time back I was at a sports day at a place called Coppabella, a tiny railway town in the northern part of my electorate, west of Mackay. One of the teachers said to me, `That fellow could be an Olympian. Trouble is he won't make it because he won't be given the edge, that special edge that he needs in coaching terms'. I asked what we could do about it, and he said, `I think we need some sort of coaching clinic because he's not the odd person out. There are dozens of people, young people particularly, right across the nation, particularly in country areas, who have it but never get the opportunity'.
      </para>
      <para>
       I took this issue to the Australian Railways Union which, in cooperation with the Queensland Government, ran the Railway Institute at Coppabella-and I point out that this was a National Party Government. I spoke to the education officers in Rockhampton and asked whether they would be prepared to assist in establishing a weekend clinic if I could get a sponsor. The Coppabella area would provide the facilities and the Coppabella Railway Institute, with the backing of the union, would supply the food and accommodation if the Education Department would supply the coaches. It took some time to put it together, but it happened.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am told from conversations I have had with the parents, the individual kids and the teachers of those eight or nine schools who participated in this sports day-in some cases there were only five or six kids from each small school-that it was one of the greatest successes they had ever seen. It was not the biggest day in terms of participants and it was not the biggest day in terms of spectators, but in terms of the quality of performance and the quality of coaching it was the zenith.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would argue that we need to duplicate this event right across this nation in rural Australia. We need to give those kids in little schools and small towns the chance to work at the edge, to improve their performance at the edge, as it was suggested to me by that teacher. There are kids missing out because of geographical disadvantages; because of the cost of travel, the lack of opportunity and the lack of availability of quality coaching. It simply comes back to the numbers game; it comes back to the cost of providing facilities. They simply do not have those facilities. They run on dirt tracks and half-grass tracks. They do not have the tartan tracks that the athletic groups have in the capital cities and the major provincial cities; they run, as it might be said, in the bush.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no magic wand to solve this problem because we are talking about taxpayers' money. We are talking about economies of scale. But we are also talking about a philosophy that we certainly have in the Australian Labor Party that we ought to have policies that accommodate the needs of all Australians, not just those who live in the major cities of our nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       We need to come up with some answers. The issue here in the first instance is talent identification. We will not identify the talent unless kids have an opportunity to be involved in the sport in question. We will not identify the talent unless the young people have the chance to participate in some form of competition. We cannot assess a child running down a bush road, but we can make an assessment when four or five young people participate in small school sports, fight it out together and are timed in a race. We can see from the skills they have and the style that they use that, as the teacher to whom I referred said to me 18 months ago, `This kid could be an Olympian'.
      </para>
      <para>
       I argue that we need to establish a joint government sports network for non-metropolitan Australia. It could come under the terms of reference of the Australian Sports Commission. It could be taken up through a joint ministerial approach by the Ministers of sport right across the nation. We need to acknowledge that there are young people out there in the broad areas of Australia who have the capacity and potential to achieve but who will not reach the line unless they are given special assistance. I would argue that such an approach be at least started by way of negotiations or at the discussion table so that Ministers could get together and come up with a policy that would address what I see as a problem-a national problem.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is a problem not only of talent identification, but also of provision of facilities. As I said before, there is no way that we are going to provide a tartan track in some of the small country towns. But if we took on the concept of multipurpose facilities, using a central point in a region-the largest town in the area that services a region-then we may be able to meet this need. We may be able to address the problem. This approach to multipurpose facilities ought to be pursued on a community, schools and local authority basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have many examples in my area where this approach could work. For instance, Moranbah has some 13,000 people. It is a mining town in the northern part of my electorate. Surrounding it we have towns such as Coppabella, the railway centre that I mentioned earlier, Nebo, Dysart and Clermont, which is not part of my electorate but is not far away, and the general district. That figure of 13,000 people suddenly grows to 30,000 people. Given financial support from local authorities, from State and Federal governments and the community, the necessary facilities could be provided.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is also the question of travel costs. I have no magic wand for this issue, but I wonder how we overcome the travel costs. How do we ensure that young people-whether they be individuals or part of a team-can compete in sports with teams in other areas? It may be that we need to give assistance to local authorities for the provision of sports buses. We do this sort of thing for the aged, so this is not an issue for which there is no precedent. We have an excellent approach with day respite care programs throughout Australia. I know in my own area, in Yeppoon, recently we allocated $300,000 and that was initially for capital costs of the buses and facilities and then recurrent costs for the bus driver. This means that elderly people and disabled people are able to go to one centre on the whole Capricorn coast area on a regular daily basis to benefit from the facilities and services that are provided.
      </para>
      <para>
       I argue that, just as we provide those services for the elderly, we need now to target the young. We need to acknowledge that there are kids out there who deserve a better opportunity and we need to assist them. From a funding point of view, perhaps we could find a way around this by setting up what I have simply called a national sports foundation. People in the private sector who are given an incentive-and it comes back to tax incentives or monetary incentives-would be prepared to support such a structure if it were to their advantage. That money could then be used to support the would-be Olympians, to support young people participating at the State level and to support the regional programs which I have discussed in my contribution today.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is certainly a need for what I am suggesting and our Government, the Hawke Labor Government, has already indicated its understanding of the problem. The 1990-91 report, Commonwealth Assistance for Local Projects, which I received from the Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin), points out what has taken place in the community recreation sporting facilities program. It also demonstrates the demand that exists for facilities. So this is not just an issue of a few people in Moranbah or Nebo or Coppabella saying that they need these facilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report shows a record of demand. In a period of two years, there were 2,000 applications and the requests for funding amounted to $200m. The initiative taken by the then Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, made available $13m. That was a very generous amount in comparison with what was given before because nothing was given before, so that was a lot of money. But I ask honourable members to consider that situation. There were 2,000 applications with requests for funding for projects amounting to $200m. We had $13m to spend and we were able to fund 382 projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       I suggest to the House that those 2,000 applications represent only a very small part of the demand in the community. The reason why that is only a small part of the demand is that this special scheme which was initiated by the Federal Labor Government was for the upgrading of existing facilities. It did not cover other issues; it did not go to the issue of talent identification or sports development when it came to the personnel involved; it did not go to the issue of travel costs or to the issue of coaching. So when we add in all those other projects that at the moment are being left to the States, I would suggest that figure of 2,000 applications could blow out to 20,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Federal Government has given a lead in the provision of this money. Regrettably money has not been allocated for this financial year, but I am hoping that the scheme will be resuscitated. The Federal Government deserves credit, as do previous governments, for giving the priority that has been warranted to sport. But I believe we now need to give emphasis to the rural and country parts of Australia and we need to ensure that the kids who live out there have the same opportunities as their counterparts in the metropolitan area.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the few moments I have left, I wish to go to another issue. I have raised this matter, in part, in this House on other occasions. Once I raised it in a party situation and I received a few cracks that I was looking for a plaque recovery for the economy of Australia. I suggested that we needed a `plaque system' to ensure that we did not lose the heritage that we have. In the past we have funded a famous peoples, places and events commemorative program. Having spoken to a previous Minister, Mr Barry Cohen, I now find that funding for that has dropped from hundreds of thousands of dollars in past years to only $50,000 this year. I believe that we cannot risk the loss of our heritage. We have to reactivate interest at the local, State and community levels to preserve and protect those important places and sites. We need to preserve the sites; we need to preserve the events. We also need to designate sites and past events. We need to try to find funds-possibly mixed funding-to renovate the famous places and also in some way to commemorate the people and the events in question.
      </para>
      <para>
       My immediate answer to this problem would be to come up with a national heritage plaque that could be produced, I argue, at a low cost, when one considers the economies of scale. I would suggest that these plaques be made available across the nation to local governments and community historic groups so that they could be put in place to designate some historic aspect that relates to our nation, be it post-1788 or pre-1788. That would encourage the recording of local history. It would involve local authorities more in this important area. It would also ensure that we have community involvement because there would be a task of ensuring that we authenticate the claims that are made.
      </para>
      <para>
       In all, we would gain because people today are interested in our history, be they domestic or overseas tourists. When they come to my area, they want to go to Mount Morgan; they want to see what central Queensland has been all about; they want to read about the history of the region. Yet they go to some places in my area and there is no way of knowing what really took place because there is no record of the event and no description of the place.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are advantages in economic terms from a tourism point of view. There are also advantages from an educational point of view and there are certainly advantages from a community involvement point of view because emphasis would be given to local history. I therefore ask the Minister to give consideration to this scheme. It could be simply a development of the present commemoration scheme that is in place. It would require additional funds, but I suggest the advantages would be many.

      <para>
       The Bill includes a number of amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, as has already been pointed out. These amendments will allow any money collected by the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service for leases, licence permits and other authorities to be used by the Service in its conservation role by having the money paid into the national parks and wildlife fund instead of into Consolidated Revenue. That is indeed history in the making. We have heard so often, at both State and Federal level, that all these funds that are collected by government bodies, no matter how small, have to go into Consolidated Revenue. I commend the Government for this step forward.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Bill also permits the Director to invest money held by the Service but not needed immediately and to accept bequests in the form of shares, securities and other forms of investment. I find this to be astonishing, wonderful reading; it is certainly something very new on the agenda in terms of available money coming into the hands of government bodies.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am particularly interested, as I am sure the honourable member for Lindsay is, in the increased funding that might now become available to the National Parks and Wildlife Service and associated Commonwealth services to engage in more research into, for example, bushfires. We come from an area that, prior to the last bushfire season in the Blue Mountains, was described as a powder keg. It is probably the worst potential fire area in the world today. The main reason for that is that we have not had a major fire through the Blue Mountains, which contains quite a bit of Commonwealth territory, for eight or nine years, maybe longer.

        —As the honourable member reminds me, it has been 13 years. As every experienced bushfire fighter knows, as the honourable member knows, and as I know, having been a captain in the surrounding area for nine or 10 years, the hazard that has built up as a result of the inability of those who could reduce that hazard to do so has created a tremendous problem, and a quite frightening one.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       A couple of days before Christmas-perhaps it was Christmas Eve-we had a very serious bushfire in the Hawkesbury region in an area where there had not been any hazard reduction for many years. Anybody who has been to an area of heavy bushland where hazard reduction programs have not been undertaken knows that when the fire conditions are right-when there is very low humidity and high temperatures and, in our situation, strong north-westerly winds-there is the potential for a great disaster. Indeed, quite horrendous fires occurred on that day, making the attendance of the very well equipped and trained bushfire fighters almost meaningless.
      </para>
      <para>
       When these wildfires get going-as they do in the Blue Mountains and as they will do again, if not in the next season then certainly in the not too distant future-it does not matter how well equipped the brigades are. I pay tribute to the bushfire brigades in the Blue Mountains and to the council and the fire control officer in that area for what they have done in equipping the brigades. The whole fleet is now dieselised in terms of the engines in the trucks and the pumps on the back, and the training that has been undertaken is very good.
      </para>
      <para>
       Having said all that, if we get a fire through the area without having done the necessary hazard reduction there will be massive loss of life. I can see the honourable member for Lindsay and myself approaching the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), perhaps after next December-it is quite feasible-to tell him that 1,000 or 2,000 homes have been destroyed by an horrendous fire. One of the main reasons why we have this great difficulty, as has been indicated a number of times, is that some areas of government-not only Commonwealth but State as well-do not have funding available to allow personnel to engage in the necessary hazard reduction activities. When I see that money will be allowed to be used by the government bodies who receive fees and lease money and all sorts of other things, I am very hopeful that there will be a removal of this difficulty that confronts many government bodies. In the past they have used lack of funds as an excuse to limit the hazard reduction that is necessary in these areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       Many people have mentioned hazard reduction in this debate. For the benefit of those people who might not know, hazard reduction simply involves choosing a time when the conditions which would allow a serious fire to occur are totally absent but when it is still possible to burn the underlayers of rubbish that gather over the years. As leaves and bark fall, these levels build up to sometimes 20 to 30 tonnes to the hectare of bushland. When a fire occurs and there are the conditions I mentioned earlier-low humidity, high temperature and strong north-west winds-we have a bushfire that is absolutely uncontrollable. They are called wildfire or crown fires and they roar through the tops of the trees like blow torches.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have attended some of these fires; I have watched them coming out of the valleys. They roar out of the valleys like giant blowtorches I have watched the big signs on the corners of the highways and roads actually melt before my eyes and drop in a heap of solder because of the intensity of the heat. I have seen the rocks on the side of the roads in the cuttings explode because of the heat. That heat has been generated because the fire has been a wildfire that has resulted from the lack of hazard reduction in areas that are prone to regular fires.
      </para>
      <para>
       If it were possible for us to leave the bush as it is and, hopefully, not see any fires pass through, that would be lovely. But because we have hundreds of thousands of houses scattered throughout these fire-prone areas something has to be done to reduce that fire hazard. I hope that a lot more money will become available as a result of the amendments to this legislation to enable State and Federal bodies who are able to do so to give assistance to local bushfire brigades and councils so that hazard reduction programs can be undertaken much more quickly.
      </para>
      <para>
       I know that the New South Wales Government has made amendments to the legislation to allow a workable arrangement between the Forestry Commission, the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service and local councils to work together. This is very commendable, and has been done to enable hazard reduction to take place in the Blue Mountains at a faster rate.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do think more money needs to be allocated to this problem. If we become more generous with these relevant bodies, then the honourable member for Lindsay and I will not find ourselves ringing the Prime Minister and others with horrendous tales, seeking massive assistance for the tremendous damage that will result-particularly in the Blue Mountains during the next or the following fire season-if nothing is done.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is not to say that we want to see the whole of the mountains burnt out. There is no more ridiculous viewpoint than that. We need a collective effort from the points of view of organisation and the granting of further financial assistance to enable this to be done in a very practical, organised way so that there will be strips of land around residential areas where firefighters will be able to reduce the hazard, and as well in other strategic areas so we will have some ability to control the fires in the Blue Mountains-fires which are looming upon us and which will be quite horrendous.
      </para>
      <para>
       I know I have the full support of the honourable member for Lindsay, who is at the table, in this regard. I hope that between us we will be able to apply more pressure, and perhaps get more assistance as a result of the extra money which I hope will be available following these amendments, to assist councils and to reduce the impending horror. I am not overstating the situation when I say `impending horror'. Anybody who has experienced a bushfire of the kind that can occur in the Blue Mountains will know exactly what I am talking about. We believe that the ingredients are now in place for a major conflagration in the Blue Mountains. It will make a very, very vivid impression on the minds of people who will experience it.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was very interested to draw out an old cutting that was in the Daily Telegraph in February 1985. It is headed `Politicians and ``greenies'' mean more Ash Wednesdays'. It is an expression of the views of a fellow named Ron Prior who was interviewed by Mike Safe, a journalist. Mike Safe said that he was talking `with a man burned up about lack of action on bush fires'. It is quite a good article. It is further headed, `Firefighter foresees future of ashes'.
      </para>
      <para>
       I see great destruction pending in the Blue Mountains and in other areas around the State-indeed, around the country- because we have this ultra concern about not destroying any bushland at all.
      </para>
      <para>
       I noticed when I was out at the fire on 23 December last year that during the day we had this tremendously uncontrolled burning of a crown fire, but when the weather conditions cooled down during the night, and the wind dropped and the humidity rose, the fire continued on through the bush, but all it did was take away the litter in a most wonderful way on the forest floor, leaving intact the boles of the trees and many of the shrubs which were about. They did not burn at all-they retained their greenery-whereas many of the trees burnt during the day were totally destroyed. I am talking about trees 40 to 50 feet high. The heat of the fire totally destroyed those trees.
      </para>
      <para>
       Anyone who remembers the bushfire which passed through the Grose Valley-in another part of the Blue Mountains through the Bilpin area-in 1979, I think it was, can visit that magnificent area of bushland today and see that it is still recovering. It has not returned to what it was due to the fact it had this giant wildfire pass through it. There had been no hazard reduction in that area in previous years.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am making a plea tonight that we be very generous towards organisations which have anything to do with the future protection of people who live in these fire prone areas. I do not intend to speak about policies where councils may have been a bit indiscreet in allowing people to build in areas where they ought not have been allowed to build. That is another area which needs to be looked at, but it is straying a bit far away from this Bill. I have perhaps strayed a little far away from it in some respects already.
      </para>
      <para>
       I draw this major problem to the attention of the House and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly). The Minister happens to be visiting my electorate in the Blue Mountains on the coming weekend, and she will see for herself how magnificent that area is, how many lovely homes there are in the area and how these may be preserved, and how damage may be minimised if there is an intelligent undertaking of careful hazard reduction-and if the money is made available to government agencies, both Commonwealth and State, to be able to do that.
      </para>
      <para>
       I commend this matter to the honourable member for Lindsay. I am sure he will be seeing the Minister when she visits the area. I know he shall bring it to her attention and that she will be very sympathetic to whatever he has to say.

        —The Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 now before us relates to a number of Acts, including the National Library Act 1960, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 and the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988. A number of these issues have been canvassed by other speakers in the debate.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I would like to focus my attention on two particular aspects that are picked up in this legislation. One relates to some minor amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 and the other to the Australian Sports Commission Act 1989, which will ensure that the financial transactions and general state of affairs of the Australian Sports Foundation are included in all reports to the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) prepared by it under section 63m of the Audit Act 1901. (Quorum formed)
      </para>
      <para>
       It is delightful once again to see such a large number of honourable members drawn to the House when I am on my feet.
      </para>
      <para>
       The issue I want to pursue is that of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. It is one which was canvassed in this House quite recently when the legislation came to this place. Of course it is something that honourable members of both sides of the House would endorse. At that time I expressed some concerns about the nature of the agency and the way in which it would operate. I will once again take the opportunity to say that there is concern on my part about how the information which the agency gets will be used by sports administrators.
      </para>
      <para>
       A number of those drugs which are on the testing list for the agency are drugs for which their efficacy in improving sports performance has not been established. Indeed, the use of some drugs on the testing list is illegal. It concerns me that the use of the agency may lead to conviction or indeed great embarrassment to sports people who may be tested in the course of their sport and found, for various reasons, to be using these substances.
      </para>
      <para>
       A concern was expressed after the last Olympic Games about the arbitrary level at which some of the blood levels have been set for sporting performance. Indeed, it was the case during those Olympic Games that one athlete from Australia was ruled out of the competition because his level of caffeine was above the level that had been established. However, it was established in an arbitrary way, for at the previous Olympics the level at which he was judged ineligible would have been adequate and acceptable. So there is concern about the way in which the agency operates.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no concern about the fact that we need such an agency, that there needs to be random testing of athletes and that athletes need to understand that using substances to enhance their performance will not be tolerated. There is concern about the way in which the agency operates. The agency needs to be vigilant and not judgmental in the way in which information is used and is made available to sports administrators. It needs to be carefully monitored. It is with interest that I will watch the performance of the Sports Drug Agency, which is in its infancy. I imagine that in future reports of the Sports Commission we will see the progress of that agency and will be able to follow it.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other issue I wish to canvass is that of the Australian Sports Commission. As is included in this legislation and as I pointed out earlier, in the future the records of the Sports Commission will contain the state of financial affairs of the Australian Sports Foundation. This Foundation was set up within the ambit of the Sports Commission to canvass and obtain funds from the private sector and to provide significant tax benefits to those who choose to be benefactors of sport. The majority of the funds that were made available through the Foundation last year were directed to particular projects and sports. Of the order of $9m was available to sport last year through this fund. Certainly it is something that has been very beneficial to sport in general and to the way in which amateur sports in particular can receive funding.
      </para>
      <para>
       What is more important to me than the way in which the Australian Sports Commission operates is the way we see the development of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). It is something about which I have spoken before in this place and about which I will continue to speak until I am satisfied that the aims and intentions of the Government and the Martin Finance and Government Operations Committee, which reported on sport, have been satisfied by the way in which the ASC operates. No-one would have been a greater supporter of the Australian Institute of Sport than myself. Conceptually, I believe that it was the right thing to do.
      </para>
      <para>
       Over the last decade there has been significant change in the way in which sport is structured and administered in this country and it is important that we take that into consideration. When we look at the development of elite sports people, it is important that we take into account the geographical, climatic and regional differences in this country and realise that if we are to fund and develop elite sports people, we need to do it where they are, where it is most convenient for them and where the coaches are. It is not a sensible approach in a country with the size and geography of Australia to have all that centralised in Canberra.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have significant and very high quality facilities in Canberra-no-one would doubt that-but what we do not have in Canberra is the people. As the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) would understand, the majority of young people, the majority of athletes, are in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth or Brisbane-in the major centres of population in this country. I think it is necessary for us to consider that when we talk about developing elite sports people in this country and the way in which we allocate funds for that purpose.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is the case that since the Australian Institute of Sport was established most of the State governments have established institutes of sport themselves. They are now providing sports science backup, sports medicine backup and coaching expertise to support the athletes, including the developing athletes, in those places. The suggestion has been made-and indeed it is canvassed by the AIS-that the AIS needs to provide associate scholarships for these people who choose not to come to a central program. This is essentially an argument about who gets the credit for the development of sports people. We need to go beyond that. It is nonsense to be arguing about naming rights when we talk about the development of elite sports people. We should be making sure that our allocation of resources is as efficient as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is the case in some sports that it is appropriate to have a centralised training program in one place because of the number of talented athletes available, the coaching expertise that is available or the necessary facilities that are available, but in the majority of sports that is not the case. It is not necessarily the best way.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the moment we find that many sports and sports administrators are held to ransom by the fact that they are under the impression that they will lose their funding and that their sport will lose assistance from the AIS unless they are involved in a national centralised program. Many athletes see their only chance of national selection and of getting the best coaching as being through centralised programs, and in a sense they are pushed towards those programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       What we should be doing, what the Australian Sports Commission should be doing-and it is what the Martin Finance and Government Operations Committee recommended and indeed I believe it is the intention of the Government-is supporting the best athletes wherever they are. `Wherever they are' does not mean supporting an athlete living in Widgiemooltha by himself; it means supporting athletes where they have accredited and well supervised and supported programs. That is what we mean when we talk about decentralising the AIS, increasing its efficiency and making the dollars go as far as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       The last time I spoke on this issue-only a few weeks ago-there was considerable media follow-up. Jeff Wells, in his article in the Australian of the weekend of 16-17 February, went to this issue. He was talking about the Australian Sports Commission and in particular the approach of ASC Executive Director, Jim Ferguson. I quote his last paragraph:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . he can be a statesman and grasp the logic of the coaches' concept that sport is best served by a federal network of excellence-not a federal centre of excellence.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think that is the issue that needs to be taken up here. We need a network of excellence in this country. The last time I spoke here I talked about swimming and I pointed out the fact that the Australian Institute of Sport's centralised swimming program received $700,000 and produced five out of the 38 athletes who were in the national team at the beginning of this year. A small program in Western Australia with $140,000 produced six athletes, and if you include the long distance swimmers many more. The majority of the athletes in the national team-33 out of 38-were produced in centres all around the country, close to their homes under the supervision of their own excellent coaches. The same should apply in a number of sports.
      </para>
      <para>
       Subsequent to that speech, just last weekend we had the national athletics championships. Again I point to the results. The performances of Western Australians in the national championships last week were extraordinary. I am not trying to be parochial in saying this, but although Western Australia has a relatively small population, seven national titleholders were from Western Australia-the best ever for that State. It is coincidental, but I believe that the following correlation is compelling: in Western Australia we have a program from the Western Australian Institute of Sport that indeed is embryonic but that is supporting future elite athletes. The way in which that program operates has been responsible for a great deal of the resurgence of sporting performance.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am sure that the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) will be interested to know that the national high jump champion is now a young Western Australian woman named Alison Inverarity, who jumped 1.94 metres-which is taller than him or me. Indeed, she is now ranked seventeenth in the world. She is a product of this regional program in Western Australia, which has excellent sports science and sports medicine backup and an outstanding coach in Tutor Bidder, who is a former Welsh national coach.
      </para>
      <para>
       I could go on and talk about other programs. The point I am trying to make is that the results in these national championships are indicative of the fact that local programs where people live can provide the sort of support and development that is important for our elite athletes.
      </para>
      <para>
       The arguments that we hear against this are interesting, but I do not think they carry weight. The first argument we hear is that, in an educational and vocational sense, the assistance that is available in Canberra through the AIS is greater than that which can be provided in the States. That makes a mockery of the fact that the States are responsible for education. Indeed State governments involved in State programs are in an excellent position to provide vocational and educational backup and support for athletes in their area.
      </para>
      <para>
       The fact that many young athletes could live at home with their parents is a huge plus. It must be as a last resort that we move towards centralised programs in sport. In respect of coaching, we can take the example of Western Australia. I have already mentioned Tutor Bidder and the success that he has had, but now the Western Australian Institute of Sport has secured the services of Andre Rodionenko, who was the coach of the women's gymnastic team from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics at the 1985 and 1987 world championships. He was the coach of the gold medallist in all round gymnastics for women in 1988. He is arguably the best women's gymnastic coach in the world, and he is part of that program. The rowing program in Western Australia has Stephan Muhlenberg, who was a former East German rowing coach at world championships and Olympic Games.
      </para>
      <para>
       Coaching quality is available not only in Western Australia, but in many other places. The only person who has been producing gold medal winning swimmers in this country over the last few Olympics is Laurie Lawrence, whose program is on the other side of the country. It is not the case that all coaching expertise resides in Canberra; indeed, it is spread across the country.
      </para>
      <para>
       When we look at the facilities, it is very clear that in Western Australia we have excellent facilities when it comes to swimming, gymnastics, hockey and cricket. In Tasmania we have a rowing program because of the excellence of the facility there. In Queensland, where the climate is so conducive to swimming, we have the impetus of the facilities that are available for swimming. When we look at sports medicine and sports science backup, we find that what is available all around the country is the equivalent of anything available in Canberra.
      </para>
      <para>
       We need to understand that a centralised fortress in Canberra is not the appropriate model for the next decade, and it is important that we consider that the future of the development of elite sportsmen in this country lies in the States where the people are.
      </para>
      <para>
       The AIS has led the way so far, but in the future it will be State programs that will do so; if the Australian Sports Commission is not careful and does not take note of this changing trend, then it will be left behind in the development of elite sports people in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is not a States rights issue; it is an Australian perspective, and cooperative effort is required if we are to use our sporting dollars most efficiently. That is the aim of the Australian Sports Commission. It was set up to provide independent and expert advice and an expert way of managing sports dollars in this country. It is my view that if its members are wary of the changes that are occurring in sport they will take a view that decentralisation of these programs is the way that we have to go in the 1990s.

       One of the characteristics of portfolio Bills is the fact that in many cases they provide for minor technical amendments, but honourable members appropriately take the opportunity to extend the debate across areas of interest and concern. To that extent, the final contribution, by the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), is an indication of the way in which debates can be used. People would be aware of the honourable member's long association with and contribution to Australian sport. I listened with a great deal of interest to his contribution to the debate. He brought to this debate a great deal of knowledge in the area of Australian sport and I think the House appreciated his thoughts.
      </para>
      <para>
       The contributions by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) touched on a number of issues relating to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. In particular, the honourable member for Macquarie made reference to his concerns about bushfires in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales. As a near neighbour of the honourable member for Macquarie, I can identify with those concerns, because the Blue Mountains area has been devastated on many occasions by bushfires. There was great concern during the course of the last summer-continuing into the early autumn-that once again that area could be ravaged by bushfires. It is one of those great natural disasters that is always on the minds of people who inhabit that part of New South Wales. The thoughts that were provided in the debate by both the honourable member for Cook and the honourable member for Macquarie have been noted.

       The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) in his contribution brought to the debate his special interest as chairman of the caucus committee on the arts, sport, the environment, tourism and territories. His interest covers the range of matters that are being dealt with in this Bill. I understand that a great deal of his contribution related to developments in far north Queensland in the Tully region, and in particular the Tully Millstream. That has been an area of interesting controversy as far as the proposals by the Queensland Government are concerned.

       I have had an opportunity to visit that area in recent times, and I realise that it poses some interesting dilemmas in debates relating to environmental questions, particularly when we look at the obvious questions of potential energy resources that could be provided by projects like that. Yet, on the other hand, people would obviously feel concern when magnificent rivers face potential damage because of major developmental projects.

       The proposal of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) related to his interest in country Australia, particularly central Queensland. I know of his interest in the King O'Malley aspect of the commemorative project that is part of the portfolio responsibility. I know that most people would recognise the great contribution that that great character in Australian politics has made to the political life of this country. The honourable member for Capricornia has made very strong and persistent representations to my office in wanting to push the case for an appropriate commemoration of King O'Malley's presence in the Capricornia region of central Queensland.

       As most people are aware, the amendments to the series of Acts that are covered by the Arts, Sport, Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill are largely of a technical nature but, as I indicated at the outset, they do allow members who are participants in this debate the opportunity to range fairly widely. I think in that sense portfolio Bills serve a useful function because they allow honourable members who contribute to these debates an opportunity to press those principal matters of concern to them. In particular, it gives honourable members who have a particular electorate in or professional relationship with some of the areas that are covered by the portfolio amendment Bills an opportunity to add that additional presence and contribution to the debates.

         —The Immigration (Education) Amendment Bill has been introduced to provide the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs power to broaden the categories of people who may avail themselves of English language and citizenship courses. The explanatory memorandum tells us that it also makes a number of minor technical amendments. That explanatory memorandum, which is the font of all wisdom in these matters, goes on to say:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bill provides that the Minister may arrange for English courses and citizenship courses to be provided to particular categories of persons . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        and for the Minister to arrange:
       </para>
       <para>
        for the courses to be provided to persons who hold a Temporary Entry Permit of a class specified by the Minister by notice in the Gazette.
       </para>
       <para>
        On reading all of that, we are little further enlightened as to what we are in fact discussing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) was one page long. He told us, by way of a little further elucidation, that the Bill allows persons holding temporary entry permits of classes specified by him to have access to adult migrant English program courses and citizenship courses and goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        This will enable participation in such courses by asylum seekers and nationals of the People's Republic of China and their spouses in accordance with temporary residence arrangements and access to government services for these groups announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his speech to Parliament of 27 June 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we know now that the Immigration (Education) Amendment Bill is about the provision of extra benefits to People's Republic of China (PRC) nationals who happened to be in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen massacre. Specifically, it allows for those people with a four-year temporary entry permit and their spouses who have been enabled by this Government to join them here in Australia to have access to the adult migrant education courses and citizenship courses provided by the Government at the expense of the taxpayers of Australia. According to the Government's estimates, approximately 11,000 people may avail themselves of these courses.
       </para>
       <para>
        To many, this Bill represents another flagstone in the bypass to permanent residency for a group of people who have not been required to satisfy normal migration criteria. This is reinforced by the explanatory memorandum which tells us that the very people about whom we are speaking are, `persons who have qualified for special provisional residence categories in Australia'. I do not know what was meant by the draftsman, but all honourable members will know that the explanatory memorandum is an aid to interpreting legislation and if people wanted to believe that temporary entry might lead them to permanency in Australia one could be forgiven for believing that that was a possibility when one sees that the Government uses the term that these are people who have qualified for special provisional residence categories in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill allows for access to English language and citizenship courses. We in the Opposition are not opposing that grant of permission to participate in those courses. But we do have concerns as to the way in which the Government has proceeded with this matter, as we have had concerns about the way in which the Government has dealt with the question of Chinese students generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first matter I seek to have clarified very clearly by the Government is that this Bill, which speaks of providing both English language and citizenship courses, is not providing citizenship courses discretely which are intended to aid people who are intending to be long term settlers in Australia. If they were discrete courses, I could see no reason to provide citizenship education to people for whom long term settlement in Australia is not intended. I have been assured that they cannot be separated. If that is the case, that ought to be made clear by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is the outcome of the inconsistent, ill-considered, ad hoc and, frankly, chaotic matter in which the issue of PRC nationals has been handled by this Government. The Opposition's position in regard to this matter has been consistent, considered and in keeping with the principles of existing criteria, long applied by Australia for migration selection and refugee determination. We have at all times said that there was no basis for the creation of a special category; that there was no basis for disadvantaging this group by not treating them with the respect accorded all other claimants for refugee status within Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the significant decisions made in relation to PRC nationals since the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, now the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), announced on 6 June 1989 an extension of temporary entry permits for PRC nationals, legally or illegally in Australia as at 4 June, until the end of the following month. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), belatedly realising the gross inadequacy of this provision, later announced on 16 June that the Government was further extending the visas for another 12 months until 31 July 1990. At the time of his announcement, Senator Robert Ray clearly enunciated the Government's intention to treat PRC nationals like any other applicant for refugee status. In the Senate Hansard of 6 June 1989 at page 3415, the then Minister said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Applications will not be determined on the basis of a class of people, but on individual merits. They will be considered on the basis of individual claims.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems that the Prime Minister forgot this little dictum when he announced on the Jana Wendt program exactly one year later the creation of a special category for PRC nationals. In a move characteristic of the Prime Minister's disregard for the parliamentary process, with which we are all familiar, he failed to consult his own Cabinet on a decision which was to have a significant and lasting impact upon the entire immigration program of this country. The Prime Minister announced a special immigration category for 19,400 Chinese nationals in Australia before 20 June 1989. This provided them with permits for temporary residence until 30 June 1993. Applications for permanent residency from members of this group would not be considered if the political situation in China did not improve at the end of the four-year period, we were led to believe.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those PRC nationals arriving after this arbitrary cut-off date nominated by the Prime Minister were entitled to apply only for refugee status under existing criteria. In this sense, they are exactly the same arrangements which apply to Sri Lankans, Lebanese, Iranians, Burmese and Fijians, to name a few of the claimants with whom we are all familiar. So we have two classes of people: some who have justifiable claims for protection and another group who may have no substantial claims for protection but are given by this Government automatic cover.
       </para>
       <para>
        By relegating this latter group to a special category, the Prime Minister was still not capable of fair dealing. He denied that very group of people, whom he told us he was seeking to protect, the protection that some of them could have rightly anticipated under applications they had already lodged within our law. The Government provided that unless PRC nationals withdrew their claims for permanent residency under refugee or special humanitarian criteria, or on the basis of family sponsorship and employer nomination, they were not entitled to benefits provided under the terms of the four-year temporary entry permit. These included, as they were announced later-at very considerable cost, I might say, to the Australian taxpayer-special benefits, family allowance, family allowance supplement, Medicare, labour market programs, English language training, with which this Bill deals, and education. The denial of these benefits represented a blatant attempt to bludgeon PRC nationals into accepting this limited form of entry permit.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, the Government scheme also denied claims by highly qualified, eminently employable and outstanding students, many of them within our universities, to be able to obtain permanent residency on occupation grounds-the very basis upon which other people are entitled to apply. The result of that has led to a very significant brain drain to Canada, the United States and Singapore in particular.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, in good faith, the Government has belatedly moved to remedy that shortcoming-a matter that I have drawn attention to previously. It was always understood that the temporary entry permits and the subsequent extensions were designed to deter PRC nationals from applying for permanent residency. The Prime Minister made it clear both in his statement and in newspaper reports as early as August 1989 that students were being refused application forms and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs was actively discouraging them from applying under this category.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fair dealing in relation to these students has been absent while blackmail has been used to compel withdrawal of applications for permanent residency. The most outrageous case of which I am aware was that of a young lady whose husband, a highly distinguished academic, was to undertake collaborative work in the United States and needed a re-entry visa to be able to return to Australia. He was told, `Your re-entry visa to go to the University of California for that collaborative work will only be given to you if your wife withdraws the application for permanent residency'-which she had separately lodged and which she was entitled to pursue. That is just one of many such outrageous cases that this Government's scheme has brought to my attention.
       </para>
       <para>
        I could go on, because there have been other developments since the announcement by Senator Robert Ray on 21 December 1989 of those who were here legally or illegally on 20 June 1989 and who believed that they qualified for refugee status and should apply before 30 July 1990- the date on which Senator Robert Ray led them to believe they were eligible to apply. That assurance that Senator Robert Ray gave was really the most unkindest cut of all.
       </para>
       <para>
        Several days beforehand, having led them to believe that they were entitled to lodge applications up until 31 July, on 19 December 1989 the new regulations that the Government introduced ensured that PRC nationals were no longer able to lodge those applications on humanitarian grounds for permanent residency and that their applications after that date would have no legal standing at all. Honourable members will know that that was because the PRC did not qualify because a country for which applications for nationals in the special humanitarian criteria had been made could not be considered until it was gazetted, and no countries were gazetted. So the Minister's invitation of 21 December can be described clearly as a rather cruel hoax on those who were considering applying in that area.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the Prime Minister declared on 16 June that the most immediate thing was to give these people the confidence they needed so that they would not be under any pressure whatsoever, it has to be remembered that the Government condemned these students to very considerable uncertainty and anxiety, and it has not relieved them of that burden until this day. Even now, to get applications processed by this Government, under the law students have had to apply to the courts of this land to compel the Department to proceed with that processing. It was part of the blackmail this Government perpetuated to ensure that they were denied that opportunity and forced into taking the four-year temporary entry arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are other matters relating to those students who were in China. In October 1989 the Government caused further confusion by applying new rules to student visas. The recruitment of new students under ELICOS-English language intensive courses for overseas students-from the People's Republic of China was suspended until January 1990 to enable a backlog of 20,000 applications in Beijing to be cleared. When the applications were reopened in January it was with more stringent criteria.
       </para>
       <para>
        This episode of mismanagement left many potential students unable to come to Australia and many penalised financially after paying up-front fees to Australian colleges. Australia had to endure the embarrassing spectacle of rioting students outside the consulate in Shanghai. Legislation in the form of the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill was required to right one of the consequences of this wrong. The cost to the Australian taxpayer of $50m, possibly, was thereby authorised to repay money to those students who were so wronged.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a category called pipeline processing that the Government introduced to deal quickly with applications of the estimated 25,000 backlog in Beijing, the Government used criteria that were much less stringent than the global criteria introduced for all other students. That meant further discrimination, in that case in favour of those who were in China, but it also allowed many intending illegal entrants into Australia. We still do not know the extent to which those post-Tiananmen Square students have obeyed the conditions of their visas and returned to China. There is enormous potential for continued numbers of overstayers as a result of that pipeline processing.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the time of the Prime Minister's extraordinary pronouncement of policy on the Jana Wendt show, the Opposition expressed grave concerns about the conduct of immigration policy and the Prime Minister's judgment on these matters. There was no sensible basis for rejecting case by case determination of PRC nationals, pre-or post-Tiananmen Square. The only fair and equitable option to pursue was the provision of proper resources for processing and an extension of time for processing under existing arrangements for determination of refugee criteria, or the other humanitarian arrangements that have since been put in place.
       </para>
       <para>
        We must remember that at the same time as this new category was created for Chinese nationals, the Prime Minister, in an extraordinary display of arrogance, dismissed out of hand the right of Khmer boat people now in Australia and applying for refugee status to be considered on a case by case basis. He simply declared that they were not political refugees. He did reconsider that matter later, but it was evidence of his attitude on this matter and this issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Determination of Refugee Status Committee was set up to do what the Prime Minister in his arrogance said would not be done, that is, determine what their status is and who is or is not a refugee. Properly, these people were entitled to be assessed in accordance with the definition of who is a refugee, which has been the subject of international agreement. A refugee is a person who is persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion and who is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister, to his shame, pre-empted and diminished the integrity of the whole process by making his own judgment in advance of those determinations. The blanket approach adopted by the Prime Minister towards categories of people applying for protection in this country made a mockery of the entire refugee program and jettisoned long-standing and well accepted internationally recognised practice with regard to the treatment of refugees, and Australia's reputation was thereby damaged.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some Chinese nationals, without doubt, were certain to be subjected to victimisation if they were to return to China. But it is far from clear that all students pre-June 1989 would have fallen into this category, particularly given the statistics of the make-up of this group of PRC nationals. In answering a question in the Senate in November 1989 the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, Senator Bolkus informed us that of the 12,973 PRC students who were in Australia before 20 June 1989 only 12.7 per cent were enrolled in tertiary courses and the balance were in non-formal courses, the majority of which were English tuition. He said that it was estimated that 40 per cent of the Chinese ELICOS students overstayed their visas at that time with the implied intention of remaining in Australia illegally. So we knew that before this decision was announced.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where does this leave us now? In the light of the Government's recent decision to lift the last economic and political sanctions imposed on China, the Government needs to make perfectly clear its position on the future status of Chinese students in this country. I am sure all honourable members are familiar with the statement by Senator Evans of 26 February on Australia's relations with China, in which he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government today decided to remove the remaining economic and political restrictions on Australia's relations with China of those applied in June 1989 following the tragic events in Beijing on 4-5 June 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on in that statement to say in relation to the Government's view:
       </para>
       <para>
        in other respects there have been discernible improvements in the human rights situation in China.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was the stated, considered view of the Government. The Opposition has no hesitancy in saying that the proper approach to deal with PRC cases is to look at them individually. That is, each claim for protection ought to be determined on that basis. There is no doubt that the greater claim of those who were pre- Tiananmen Square could be tested in that process. Those with entitlements under existing non-discriminatory criteria for a grant of resident status should obviously have their claims also properly tested. Spouse and occupational grounds are obviously amongst those entitlements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now, I have to say that that would be the Opposition's approach at the end of 1993. The same criteria that we have long said should be applied should be applied at that point in time. If there is no need for protection in 1993, then obviously those who are here and cannot claim on any other basis should be returned to China. The Opposition has of course expressed some doubts about the human rights situation in China. This view is obviously not shared by the Government, however. Under our approach, the question of human rights violations would have had no bearing on our own immigration program. On 27 June 1990, the Prime Minister observed that:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . unless we were confident that the situation in the PRC was such that human rights were no longer generally at risk, permanent residence would be granted to those that apply.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was the Government's stated position.
       </para>
       <para>
        Citing the `discernible improvements in the human rights situation in China' as adequate cause for lifting sanctions, will the Government now advise the PRC nationals in Australia on 20 June 1989, and indeed all of us, that as of 30 June 1993 those without permanent residence granted under normal immigration criteria will be required to leave? Will the Government announce that now?
       </para>
       <para>
        I have indicated that the Bill under discussion is not opposed by the Opposition. But that does not in any way derogate from the flawed decisions that the Government made which allowed PRC nationals to stay in this country. This Bill provides English language and citizenship courses under the adult migrant education program. But, according to the explanatory memorandum from which I quoted earlier, these places will be funded out of current appropriations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In December 1990, the report of the working party on post-secondary education training `identified significant gaps in resourcing and deficiencies in outcomes in English language programs'. The report from the Government's advisers said that many migrants were forced to leave programs before they had reached professional goals; and that these gaps applied to programs funded and administered at all levels of government. The report estimates that about 360,000 overseas born Australians do not speak English well or at all and, of those, 170,000 are in the labour force now. The working party estimated that less than one-third of these have any form of access to language training. Already, according to this report, there is a backlog of between 50,000 and 60,000 long term residents of this country with language difficulty who are currently disadvantaged by under-resourced adult migrant education program funding. That is the Government's advice.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given these alarming statistics of the total inadequacy of language training programs, how does the Government justify disadvantaging our long term settlers, the people whom we have invited here, by allowing access to a group of people who are not, or quite possibly will never be, permanent residents of this country? Again, to quote from the report:
       </para>
       <para>
        An NESB-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, a non-English speaking background-
       </para>
       <para>
        Australian resident without access to English language learning is seriously disadvantaged, possibly for life.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill provides that 11,000 people who have only temporary entry will be permitted access to these courses and quite possibly in preference to long term Australian settlers and residents in need of English language tuition and for whom, it is said in economic terms, it is important that Australia provide that facility.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's handling of this issue has exposed its social hypocrisy, political ineptitude and intellectual vapidity. This is a matter of very real concern. The Opposition will permit the passage of this legislation; it goes through without any opposition from us. But the need for this was borne out of the Government's decisions taken in relation to the PRC nationals. It is a cost which the Government said it would bear out of Budget. But the cost of the provision of adult migrant education programs is in fact being borne not by the Budget, but at the expense of other long term residents of this country, other people who have been invited to settle in this nation. That needs to be clearly understood.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that as I go around Australia speaking on these issues, I will ensure that every person who is denied a place in the adult migrant education programs will know that there were 11,000 places, quite possibly, removed by legislation passed tonight for which the Government was unwilling to find the funds to back up the decision that it took.
       </para>
       <para>
        While I am dealing with the question of funding, there are considerable costs to the Australian taxpayer involved in the decision that this Government took in relation to the PRC nationals. As I said in my speech earlier, many of those people had no right, if they were properly assessed, to remain in Australia. They had already intended to stay here illegally, and we have permitted them to remain on without testing any claims for protection. I would not want to send anybody back who had valid claims. But it is clear that if we had had the willingness to submit people to proper scrutiny, to examine their entitlement, a number of people who were permitted to remain by the Prime Minister's announcement would not have stayed in this country; the cost to revenue would not have been as significant as it is; the prejudice to other long term settlers would not have occurred; and we would have had funds left over to assist the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in relation to his deficit.
       </para>
       <para>
        This was a flawed decision taken by the Prime Minister largely, I think, because of his own ill-considered statements made in the environment of emotional pique at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and we are still living with the consequences of his ill-considered promises at that time.

         —In speaking in support of the Immigration (Education) Amendment Bill, I would certainly commend the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). It is through his remarks this evening that we in Government finally know the humane and caring attitude of the Opposition! It condemns the actions taken by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and this Government in assisting and helping those people who, through unfortunate circumstances-particularly the Peoples' Republic of China (PRC) nationals, to which the honourable member devoted most of his remarks-have been in this country afraid of something from which they would want to flee. There is nothing in this Bill appertaining to that particular subject.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What this Bill is about is the broadening of the availability of Australia's excellent English courses under our adult migrant education program (AMEP). The Bill itself will allow more people to be eligible to participate in the AMEP courses because they are designed to provide an opportunity for recently arrived migrants with language difficulties to participate in an appropriate sequence of learning arrangements; to acquire the confidence and language skills needed to function effectively in Australian society; and, particularly, to assist our new arrivals in attaining their goals.
       </para>
       <para>
        After participating in these AMEP courses, migrants will hopefully be able then to access appropriate employment, gain entry into mainstream education and training programs, communicate effectively with local services and in social situations, and continue to learn English independently. The program itself was established in 1947-well before the Tiananmen Square massacre-and it has become the largest government-funded adult English language teaching program in the world, and is one of Australia's main settlement services.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not long after the establishment of AMEP there were few language classes, living allowances or other educational supports provided to encourage migrants of a non-English speaking background to learn English. Today English language acquisition has never been more important, and the demand for places in English courses has never been higher-an impetus that the Australian Government strongly endorses. The Language of Australia, a discussion paper on Australian literacy and language policy for the 1990s, released in December last year and quoted by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dundas, states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs estimates that there is a backlog of 50,000 to 60,000 people seeking placement in adult English as a Second Language programs. This backlog, combined with low proficiency outcomes for those people who exit the AMEP program early (due to strong demand from new arrivals), adds considerable pressure to general education and training systems.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1988-89 an estimated 35.4 per cent of all incoming adult migrants aged 16 years and over required English language teaching. Generally 94.1 per cent of refugee and special humanitarian migrants require language instruction, while 62.4 per cent of family migrants and 18.2 per cent of migrants recruited on the basis of skill also require English language proficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        English needs to be learnt early before inadequate communication strategies have been established and migrants have become habituated to employment in jobs below their actual skill levels. Through the AMEP, incoming migrants are better serviced through access to longer periods of English language support. The key features of the program not only include the teaching of English but also a comprehensive educational assessment, counselling, placement and referral service. It includes professional and curriculum support activities, underpinned by the national centre for English language teaching and research. It provides a national management information system and client support arrangements such as free child-care and income support to facilitate access to the AMEP courses by women and financially disadvantaged clients.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the AMEP national plan, by the end of 1992 it is anticipated that 85 per cent of all resources will be allocated to the following priority groups: people with occupational skills in demand, preparing to enter the work force; employed migrants, requiring further English support for full work force mobility; unemployed migrants, needing English to enhance their work chances; and people with further study needs, preparing to enrol in courses to improve their employment potential. The remaining 15 per cent of resources will be allocated to groups with equally important social and life skill needs, such as migrant women and elderly migrants.
       </para>
       <para>
        The AMEP has grown rapidly since the Hawke Labor Government came to power in 1983. This has been due to an expansion of the immigration program, the heightened awareness of the long term importance of teaching migrants English, and the recruitment of increasing numbers of qualified migrants who require sophisticated English to use their skills. Operating on a budget of $83m for 1990-91, with 70,500 participants and 5,000 courses last year, AMEP has more than 40 major language teaching centres, covering every State, located in areas where migrants live. AMEP courses reach about 80 per cent of all incoming migrants and course options are designed for people in rural as well as urban centres. Classes are offered day and night-in class, at work or at home-and at individual learning centres.
       </para>
       <para>
        Typical AMEP participants are newly arrived migrants of a prime work force age not yet employed and who have a minimal knowledge of English. In New South Wales alone the percentage of these new migrants wanting to participate in the AMEP courses is 45.9 per cent, with the demand for the courses by the migrants in Victoria being 31 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are four adult migrant education services (AMES) centres which help the migrants living in my electorate of Prospect. These centres are in Fairfield, Cabramatta, Parramatta and Blacktown. The majority of students attending these centres are from Asia, with other key groups being from the Middle East and South and Central America. The main language groups of these students are Vietnamese, Arabic, Cantonese and Spanish. Khmer is also prominent, particularly in the centres of Fairfield and Cabramatta.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of these students are newly arrived in Australia, with less than three years of residence, are aged between 25 and 34 years, have about 10 to 14 years of education or less, have a very low level of English skills, are semi-or unskilled and have no formal qualifications, and are unemployed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Three of the AMES centres were extended in 1990 to meet the increasing demand in Sydney's west. Approximately 11,000 students attended the four centres servicing my Prospect electorate and 429 courses were run at these centres in 1990. As well as general English classes a wide range of special programs were available, such as bilingual courses to assist learners with their initial English learning, study skill classes to assist students undertaking further studies in mainstream institutions, job seeking skills classes to assist students in seeking employment, pronunciation classes to help students learn the standard Australian pronunciation, language of childbirth classes to help women deal with the childbirth process in Australia, office skills courses to provide training in clerical skills, and crossover classes to provide skilled migrants with work experience and job seeking skills.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because migrants are people at different life stages they face different settlement challenges. The majority will want to work and require support to become ready for the labour market. A growing proportion will be sophisticated self-directed learners. Others will be less confident, lacking experience in classroom situations. However, the importance of obtaining a firm grounding in reading and writing, as well as speaking and listening, can hardly be overstated. English language skills provide the foundation which will expand or severely limit migrants' potential for social interaction, employment and training throughout their Australian lives.
       </para>
       <para>
        The AMEP can be seen as a shrewd economic investment in Australia's future. Even more powerfully than in the past, knowledge of English will regulate migrants' access to life choices. I quote a recent report, The Challenge of Diversity: Policy Options for a Multicultural Australia:
       </para>
       <para>
        Successful settlement in a multicultural Australia means having the opportunity to participate in and contribute to Australian life on an equal basis with all other Australians. The single most important factor in accomplishing this . . . is English language proficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is rapidly becoming obvious in our society that those migrants with the best hope of continued employment will be skilled, literate in English and flexible-that is, they must be geared for a lifetime of retraining. Unskilled people with minimal English will be vulnerable to long term unemployment and economic marginalisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Research from a 1988 report by the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, called Immigration, A Commitment to Australia, demonstrates a clear nexus between poor English, low skills and long term unemployment. This Committee consisted of a demographer, an ex-ambassador to China, a Commonwealth Government representative and representatives from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, local government and the Ethnic Community Council as well as a town planner. These people consulted relevant groups in the community to investigate and report on Australian immigration policy. This report stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        There will not be a future for unskilled people in a rapidly growing Australian work force. Industry protection in such industries as vehicles, clothing, textiles and footwear has contributed to the maintenance of the kinds of jobs which many unskilled and semi-skilled migrants have worked, instead of restructuring the economy towards high technology, skills and design intensive industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet another report entitled Immigrant Qualifications: Recognition and Relative Wage Options has found--(Quorum formed) Obviously, in calling this quorum during my speaking time, the Opposition could not acknowledge the fact that the honourable member for Dundas had no knowledge of the Bill before the House. He tried to bring up the story of the immigrants who had been caught in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the main purpose of this Bill is to expand the range of persons eligible for English tuition courses under the AMEP and to allow the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) to arrange for language training and related services to be provided to non-government organisations, I for one say `wonderful'. Many migrants, not only in my electorate but in all electorates, will also say `wonderful', because it is mainly through the training and support of the AMEP courses that migrants will get the chance to assimilate into the Australian way of life.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many reports that have been canvassed dealing with migrants and the range of skills available to migrants within Australia, but all reports have found that immigrants from non-English speaking backgrounds were perceived as identical, whether or not they had overseas acquired skills. It was also discovered that the Australian born and immigrants with some Australian qualifications were more acceptable to employers.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is where the AMEP can help and has helped migrants so much. By accessing an English language program, migrants are better able to enter other more formal education and retraining to make them more attractive to employers. Many of the migrants who benefit from AMEP courses are professionals, business migrants, skilled trades people, factory shift workers, older teenagers, home-makers, elderly parents and adults preparing for further study.
       </para>
       <para>
        According to The Language of Australia discussion paper:
       </para>
       <para>
        Unemployment rates for recently arrived immigrants are about three times higher than for Australian born workers. Immigrants who do not speak English well or at all are particularly disadvantaged. Poor proficiency in English is also a major reason for under-employment of many migrants who may have gained high professional and technical qualifications in their country of origin.
       </para>
       <para>
        This sentiment is reiterated in a report that I received only yesterday from the Bureau of Immigration Research entitled The Cost of Low Levels of English Proficiency Amongst Immigrants in the Workforce. That report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is confirmed that there is a purely economic case for immigrants not proficient in English to undertake the necessary training. It is not just poor English which is a problem, but immigrants with reasonable knowledge of English also have much to gain from further improving their proficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clearly important to develop and maintain the facilities for immigrants with little or no English to acquire a basic knowledge. But on economic grounds, the strong case for providing opportunities for those with a reasonable knowledge of English to improve it further is just as strong.
       </para>
       <para>
        The AMEP courses cater to this advice. After completing initial courses in English, migrants are offered a range of specialist courses through the AMEP, again to help them get employment and become accustomed to Australian society. Advanced English courses within the AMEP are also offered by nine independent tertiary providers or language centres based in universities around Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important that this Bill before the House be carried. It is important that we have opened up the availability of AMEP courses to more people. I support the action of the Minister in bringing this Bill forward in this way.

This is a debate about a piece of legislation which actually adds fuel to a fire which was effectively started by this Government when it chose to give special treatment to a group of People's Republic of China (PRC) students who were here in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre.

         —I do not need any help from the honourable member opposite. This is not a debate about the effectiveness or otherwise of the AMEP. In fact, this Bill amends the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 and provides power for the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to broaden categories of persons who may avail themselves of English language and citizenship courses under the AMEP. I agree with everything that the honourable member for Prospect said, but she really missed the point of what we are talking about here.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that literacy is a problem among immigrants in Australia. A report released by the Bureau of Immigration Research last month estimates that problems in English language proficiency in the work force cost Australia $763m a year. That study found that Australia's aggregate output would increase by that $763m if most immigrants became as fluent in English as those who speak it as their mother tongue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report actually compared the earnings of a person with poor English and one fluent in English and found that the person who had poor English actually earned about 6 per cent less in dollar terms. Using the 1986 census data on average annual incomes, this means that those who did not speak fluent English were actually being paid up to $2,389 a year less than those who could speak fluent English.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is then quite clearly in the interests of both Australia and the individuals concerned for migrants to undertake proficiency training in the English language. English is quite evidently the first language of Australia and I believe that, ultimately, those people who wish to live here and become Australian citizens, with only limited exceptions, should be literate in English-notwithstanding that those intending to migrate to Australia are expected to be literate in some way. That recognises that the points system takes into account the applicant's English skills, but nevertheless there are still a large number of immigrants who do not have those skills. Many of these people come here as part of the family reunion scheme or as the spouses of people who have successfully migrated here. That is not to say that many of these people are not literate in their own language; clearly many of them are. But there can be no doubt that English is needed in order for them to optimise their earning ability in the Australian work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, many people arriving here do not participate in the AMEP because they may not be aware of the importance of English for successful settlement or, for many of them, because the financial realities are such that it is most important to find a job immediately, and in some respects that may preclude them from attending an AMEP. Despite these difficulties and the enormity of the task before us, as the honourable member for Prospect correctly pointed out, the AMEP has been very successful. Approximately 70,500 people participated in the program during 1989-90; 78 per cent of these people had been in Australia for less than five years and approximately 25 per cent of them were currently employed-that is in 1989-while 55 per cent were unemployed and the remainder were not in the work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        The AMEP national plan for 1990 through 1992 took into account various aspects of the program and included the expansion of child-care facilities, a strategy to promote the AMEP to eligible clients within Australia and before arrival and to inform the general public of the program. A survey of AMEP clients was conducted in order to assess the efficiency, effectiveness and appropriateness of AMEP services.
       </para>
       <para>
        It appears that the program is much more than just a matter of teaching English to a few new arrivals in unused classrooms at night, which is the common public perception of it. Clearly, its purpose is to provide the best possible vocational opportunities to immigrants and to help them integrate into the Australian lifestyle. It sets the foundation for long term residents who may choose to become Australian citizens. In fact, the citizenship component forms an important part of the program.
       </para>
       <para>
        In effect, this Bill seeks to grant access to the AMEP to those PRC nationals who were granted a temporary entry permit by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in June last year. That is really what this debate is all about. I remind the Parliament that the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), who spoke earlier, was critical of the Prime Minister's decision to grant en masse four-year temporary permits to all PRC nationals in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Consequently, these people were granted access to various Commonwealth-funded services and were allowed to apply for grants of permanent residency under the employer nomination category and to bring to Australia spouses and dependent children.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having made that decision-I emphasise once again that the Opposition did not support it in the way it was put into effect-it would in our view nevertheless be quite unfair not to let these people work to support themselves and not to allow them access to adult migrant English language and associated courses. To this effect, as was clearly spelt out by my colleague earlier, we support the Bill before the House.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, a number of important concerns about the Bill need to be emphasised further. Firstly, we need to recognise that although the Government claims that there are no additional costs involved as additional eligibility will be met within existing appropriations, the conclusion must be that for every PRC national or spouse or families who participate in AMEP there will be one less space for those people who have migrated to Australia and who have received permanent entry status.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true that a great many Chinese nationals will not require the AMEP as they have already studied English language intensive courses for overseas students. After all, that is what they were; they were here as students. However, it is estimated that, notwithstanding those who do not need AMEP, there will be around 3,000 people who will be eligible. We have to add to those a significant number-around 5,000-of adult dependants who will also require the AMEP. This must surely be a point of concern, especially when one considers the figures I quoted earlier about the cost to the nation of having new Australians with poor English capabilities in the work force.
       </para>
       <para>
        While many of the original PRC nationals may have applied for permanent residency, the fact remains-and I am not sure that the Government has made it entirely clear, and if it has not it ought to-that the majority of these people will have to return to China in about three years. I believe that the Government has brought about a huge problem for itself in creating this special status for PRC nationals, notwithstanding the human rights issues involved, and the honourable member for Dundas made very clear our sympathy in respect of that issue. No-one is advocating-certainly not the Opposition-that they should have been sent back to China immediately.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt in the minds of Opposition members that the Government should have taken a much more thoroughly considered decision than it did. The coalition argued at the time that a case by case consideration was the only proper way to establish adequately who had valid claims to remain in Australia under existing non-discriminatory criteria. It appears that in applying for permanent residency these people will now finally be considered in this fashion. That is the correct way to go, but they are entitled to stay here until 1994, even if their applications for residency are rejected.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the Parliament of the cost of this to the community. As I think the honourable member for Dundas pointed out, there are significant costs not only in the English training programs-we have already recognised that the Government has not allocated any more money, so there will not be any more effective or recognisable costs in that-but also in jobs that may otherwise have gone to Australian citizens and permanent residents and in the access the students and their dependants have now been given to the social welfare system, and so on. Those things may well add up to a significant cost to the Australian people.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it needs to be made perfectly clear-and I know the Opposition spokesman has made it perfectly clear to these people-that those people whose applications for permanent residency have been rejected will have to leave Australia in 1994. We should not equivocate on this because there is a suggestion in all of this that somehow we are seeing the thin edge of the wedge in terms of these people. There is a distinct possibility that they may be being misled and, come 1994, they will see themselves as having some special claim to stay here.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it needs to be made abundantly clear to them that if they do not qualify for permanent residence they will be leaving-and that might mean many thousands of them. I suppose it will be a problem for the coalition, being in government in 1994, to send them back. But we will face up to that responsibility and we will go through the correct processes when the time comes.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill, which gives access to one more government-funded program, should not be seen as the thin edge of the wedge. There is no implication, in our view, that these people will be allowed to stay on after their four years are up. As I said, when in government the coalition will take appropriate action depending on and taking account of, I hasten to add-knowing that the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) is following me in this debate and knowing of his compassion- the circumstances that exist in China at that time.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it would be preferable for those who will be returning to China not to participate in the citizenship component of the program. As I said earlier, there is a citizenship component and, in a sense, when we looked at the legislation we thought it might be desirable if these people were excluded from that component of the program. Obviously, for practical reasons that was not possible. In our view the fact that they are exposed to that aspect of the program may imply to them in some way that they are being prepared for citizenship, for which of course they may never qualify.
       </para>
       <para>
        In short, the AMEP is not geared towards people who are only in Australia temporarily. The honourable member for Prospect spoke about the fact that the AMEP had been in place for all those years. But it was not geared for temporary residents; it was never intended for them. It is designed, in effect, to ensure the future security of new Australians, and to provide a service that will benefit not only the nation, but of course the individuals themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even with this in mind, the coalition is of the opinion that those PRC nationals who will be here for four years cannot be denied the right to learn English and secure employment. We take the view that the Prime Minister's decision in the first instance to grant temporary resident status to all PRC nationals, and his subsequent announcement in June of last year to enable spouses to join those in Australia and granting access to government services for this group, was fundamentally the wrong decision. It was not thought through clearly. As my colleague pointed out, there was a conflict at the time between what Senator Robert Ray was saying and what the Prime Minister subsequently announced on television to Jana Wendt, apparently without consultation with any of his colleagues, and certainly with no reference to Parliament.

        We take the position that that was fundamentally the wrong way to go about doing things. It was not thought through clearly. Whilst we were all moved-I am sure each of us was moved by the scenes we saw occurring in China at that time-the decision that the Prime Minister took was not a rational decision. It was not a decision that measured both the interests, ultimately, of those Chinese nationals and the interests of the Australian people at large.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having made the decision that it did, the Government now has a responsibility for those people. The bottom line, the real point of this legislation, of course is indicative of the Government realising the extent of that responsibility. My advice-gratuitous though it might be, and coming from a fairly new backbencher-to the Prime Minister is that in the future he might consider more carefully any selective decisions he makes on human rights issues and immigration regulations. I could perhaps advise him to be less emotional and more objective in these matters, and remind him further that his first responsibility is to Australian citizens, to those who are permanent residents pending citizenship, and to those who are seeking to migrate here who have done the right thing by joining the appropriate queue. There are plenty of people waiting in line who would certainly question the way in which this matter has been handled.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe that the vast majority of Australians-particularly ethnic Australians-are very unhappy with the way that the Government has handled this matter. Having said that, as I indicated earlier, the Opposition supports this legislation for the reason that we really now see it as being the correct thing to do for these people and for others who may well find themselves in the same situation. It would be rather churlish of us now to oppose this legislation on the grounds that it was compounding a wrong.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said earlier, this legislation in a sense really adds fuel to a fire that the Government lit for itself. It is now in a position of having all these people here and recognising that it has a responsibility to them. It is for those reasons the Opposition now sees-and it is certainly a pragmatic point of view-that it is a piece of legislation that should be supported.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, in speaking on this Immigration (Education) Amendment Bill, I would note its particular relevance to the electorate that I represent. Of the 158 electorates in Australia, my electorate has the thirteenth highest number of overseas born, or the children of overseas born. It is seventeenth when considering those people who were both born overseas and who have resided here for less than five years. There is the reality of a number of migrant hostels from the early postwar years in Merrylands and Birrong, for instance, which saw eastern European migration, both from the Baltic States and the Ukraine. Of course, in more recent times there is the Villawood Hostel. So the electorate of Reid is at the coalface of these programs. Equally, the children of these residents are in schools such as Old Guildford, which has special English programs because of the high number of overseas born students. It is crucial that the adult migrant education program (AMEP) be effective.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In looking at the issue at hand, I indicate my appreciation of the efforts made. The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) has cited figures in regard to a failure of delivery to a significant number of Australian migrants. I have not read the particular report. He did not cite the pages, but I hope later on he elaborates on the characteristics of those people to whom services were not delivered. As was noted earlier by other speakers, this service was not created yesterday morning; it has existed since the late 1940s, and it has to be seen in the context of a fairly massive increase in funding, nearly doubling in the period since 1984. So if there have been some failures in that system, perhaps they did not happen since the election of the Hawke Government; perhaps they were partially the responsibility of previous governments. I think we should bear that in mind.
       </para>
       <para>
        I know of the paper the honourable member for Dundas referred to, but not having read it I do not know whether it included a survey of the reasons for a particular non-delivery to any group of individuals. I do not know whether assessments were made of their particular interests in taking those courses, et cetera.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, I want to put on the record, in the context of some criticisms, my appreciation of the service. With the current Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand)-and also on an individual basis-I had the opportunity to go to the Westbridge Hostel to see the teachers there in operation. It is somewhat dubious to criticise the system in the context of what I saw. I have rarely seen any work group in Australia have such a feeling of value in what they are doing. They have a sense of working to a goal to which they have a very deep personal commitment. I have witnessed that at that Westbridge Hostel.
       </para>
       <para>
        If there are failures, I can say it is certainly not for lack of effort. The degree to which people go outside their normal working hours, the degree to which they have developed resource papers off their own bat, the degree of in-service that occurs both locally and on a professionally centralised basis is fairly impressive to me. As I said earlier, there is a high degree of motivation amongst the employees there. There is a great degree of participation by them on a local scale in the programs and, as I said, in amending booklets to meet particular needs.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not just a matter of equipping people to go and work in a particular job; teaching is obviously a very broad task which involves dealing with varying levels of education and indeed covers a wide variety of language abilities. Significant numbers of these migrant people are illiterate in their own tongue. Many of them are traumatised by the very violent political situations that they have come from. I have had that personal experience at the Westbridge hostel. This is the kind of reality that teaching staff face. As I said, when we consider the age disparities, the range of English abilities, the slow and advanced learners, the illiteracies and diverse previous education levels of migrants, we see that the teachers face a massive task.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we talk about AMEP, perhaps it is worth remembering that a large part of the problem that has arisen with the Chinese students does stem from one of the less well thought out penchants for privatisation of education in this country in the English language intensive courses for overseas students (ELICOS) system. That system was utilised to try to destroy the migration rules of this country. In that context there must be some concern at the push for privatisation of AMEP in 1989-90.
       </para>
       <para>
        Turning to the specifics of the issue at hand, I personally have a lot of sympathy for the Opposition's position of demanding that there should have been individual assessment of the Chinese students at the initial stage. Quite clearly, if we are to have some integrity in the system, if refugee status is to mean something, if standards of endangerment to people are to be considered, then it is very difficult to put all that in the same circle as a wholesale allowance of a particular group.
       </para>
       <para>
        As has been noted by previous speakers, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), the decision to privatise the ELICOS program has been made and we are faced with a very large number of people in Australia seeking employment, et cetera, and operating within our society and not lacking English because of this privatisation effort in regard to ELICOS. As I said, ELICOS was widely used as a subterfuge to avoid our migration policy and was contrived by significant numbers of private school owners whose interest was more financially than scholastically motivated. We have to be realistic with regard to that process in time. We are talking about a fairly extraordinary situation and a fairly unusual proportion of people in that category. That category did consist of a significant number of migrant people who were perhaps more articulate than other groups temporarily resident in this country. It was a group that, it would be fairly logical to say, might be more politically motivated, more involved in issues and therefore perhaps more inclined to be persecuted subsequently.
       </para>
       <para>
        While we say that it is wrong to give special rights to this group, some circumstances were abnormal. We have to be realistic about the politics of the situation. There are already significant complaints from the Opposition about the staffing failures in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the waiting times. What really would have been the reality if we went down and assessed each individual? As we well know with migration, there would have been constant attempts to undermine the system, distort it, fabricate situations and invent levels of political activity and possible harassment. That would not have been a process that would have been quickly overcome; it would have dragged on for some time and diverted resources from departmental requirements. Those departmental requirements often involve looking at overcoming other attempts to distort and cheat the system and to jump in front of other people who are doing the right thing by adhering to our processes by filling forms out overseas. There might be concerns that some people should not have been allowed into Australia because they did not have genuine political activity and did not face harassment. In fact, it is said that a significant number of them, because they had the money required to do these ELICOS courses, actually come from the elite of the Chinese communist party system.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I say, at the same time the resources required and the major backlog we already have with regard to processing a variety of other refugee status people from the Middle East, Sri Lanka and a number of other countries would have meant a significant waiting time for those who do the right thing which should not have been tolerated.
       </para>
       <para>
        The original position of the Opposition was that it was all very sad because these refugees were queue jumping and given special provisions. As I said, I can see the logic of that position and I have some sympathy with it, but at the same time what we are also getting is the politically self-interested emphasis on the unspecified number of individuals who are deprived of rights under this situation. I am talking about those people who were so greatly threatened, who could have migrated here under our current rules but were not given an opportunity, who were bludgeoned into not applying for other forms of residence, were relegated into a sub-category, blackmailed and not given a fair deal. This emphasis on those individuals is an attempt to cultivate some support in those areas for political self-interest. Whilst there might have been a fairly insignificant number of those people, that is more than balanced by the other side of the coin in this decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        Quite frankly, one point that I, if not the Government, would like to emphasise is the need for people to actually apply overseas to migrate so that we reduce, as the current Minister has attempted to, the number of people who seek to change status while in this country for reasons such as a sudden illness in the family, contrived marriages, et cetera. If those people have genuine fundamental rights to be part of our migration program, then perhaps we can see about that in 1993. Perhaps they can go back and apply from China just as people are lining up in Ankara to travel to Damascus and a number of other countries around the world to seek to become part of our programs. I do not think that there is really that much great hardship for the small unspecified minority who have been mentioned. We also have this new-found concern with the brain drain of these overseas students who, as the Opposition has correctly described previously, are in Australia predominantly under subterfuge to migrate anyway.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a bit hypocritical for the Opposition to talk about the Government's decision to reinstitute relations with China. There were not too many doubters in the Opposition when some of its members decided that they had better rush over to China and establish trade contacts, have deputations there and try to move things along a bit quicker than the Government was doing. To come now and say that they have a lingering interest in the rights of those people in China is perhaps questionable.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would again like to stress the efforts of the service. As indicated by previous speakers, despite some denigration, we are talking about a fairly major service unparalleled in the world in its size and endeavour. We are talking about a service that aided 70,500 people last year, a group that is predominantly lacking the language, is predominantly unskilled, and predominantly very lowly educated.
       </para>
       <para>
        There must be some concern that all of this might be destroyed by people with an ideological bent who are not willing to analyse the reality of the situation-that is, the reality of moving towards privatisation of the scheme, a privatisation that would not guarantee local availability and that would not specify the access that currently exists in regard to child-care. The honourable member for Dundas has talked about people who are denied equity of access. Certainly, it will be a lot worse if there is any attempt to bring another scheme following the ELICOS pattern into this sector as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a situation where any change or attempt to further turn this area over to the private sector-an attempt so failed through ELICOS-would involve a diminution of the network of information that currently exists; of the networking between various sites; and of the high standards of teacher accreditation, which no-one opposite could dispute; and would not cater for the particularities of this group and the different levels of requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I would like to reiterate some doubts about the original decision. We have to attempt to have some integrity in the system. Every person who is allowed into Australia causes some general public concern about the system. It creates the groundwork for community opposition and hostility to migration in general. It is unfair to those people who have legitimate claims to humanitarian access to this country. For those reasons there must be some doubts about the original decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1991, the facts are that these people will be here for four years; that they do need access to the system; and that they are part of the Australian community whether it be for four years or longer. To deny them this access and right to better their circumstances obviously undermines general society. I support the Bill.

         —We are debating the Immigration (Education) Amendment Bill in the House tonight because once again amending legislation is required to fix an Act that was changed by the Government by announcement in the press-that is, the Immigration (Education) Act. It has done it again. The Government is good at that sort of thing-government by press release. I congratulate the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is at the table. I appreciate that he was not involved in this particular debacle. Nevertheless, over and over again the Government legislates by press release.

        The thrust of the Bill that we are debating tonight, excluding a number of minor technical amendments, basically gives right of access to English language courses and citizenship courses to the Chinese nationals who were unable or unwilling to return home after the Tiananmen Square massacre. The open door policy enunciated by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) shortly after Tiananmen Square has given rise to the short-circuiting of usual migration procedures-some would claim it is queue jumping-by the large number of people who originally came to this country to further their education. Now we are being asked to facilitate that group's learning of the English language at public expense. This is most definitely a backdoor, underhanded way of fast tracking migration for a particular group of people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Surely it would have been more appropriate to investigate and assess each individual case on its merits. After all, that is the way that every other migrant or would be migrant is assessed. I know that for those who come to my electorate office and who are one point short it is no go; they are not permitted to enter Australia. They are not migrants to our country.
       </para>
       <para>
        One complaint that I have with this particular piece of legislation is the continual reference in the document itself to the word `persons'. We are in the process of so dehumanising and depersonalising the English language that perhaps we should not be teaching English at all. I maintain that English is a rich and vibrant language. It is, as a result of its richness, its comprehension and its ability to convey complex ideas in addition to straightforward statements, coming into more or less universal use.

         —Even with an accent. `Persons'-my goodness, what on earth are we all about? This Bill is about access to English language courses. I hope that these courses are a little more specific as to include gender. `Person' is such a non-specific term and word that it conjures up pictures of almost inhuman androids or the like who have no real relevance to the subject, which is in fact people. The men and women who came to this country as students on temporary short term visas and who, through the tears of the Prime Minister, have now been allowed to stay for up to four years and perhaps even permanently are individuals. They are people, not persons.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This Bill is basically a Government housekeeping Bill. It is a Bill that is necessary, I contend, because the Government needs to get its house in order to deal with some 20,000 Chinese nationals who came here to visit for several months and ended up unexpectedly staying several years, perhaps even permanently. The way in which this matter of extended visas and permanent residency has been handled was a mess from start to finish. It would appear that no checking was done as to the validity of claims for student status in order to qualify for the four-year temporary resident permit. Yet here is a government opening the way for temporary residents not only to jump the migration queue but also to shove aside those who did it the right way in order to fasttrack into English language and citizenship courses at the public expense.
       </para>
       <para>
        While on the subject of citizenship courses, I wish to raise the topic of citizenship. The definition given in the Bill is:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . a course of instruction designed to impart an understanding of ways of life in Australia and of the rights and duties of an Australian citizen.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a requirement that all migrants pass this course prior to being granted citizenship. That is my understanding. Is that so, Mr Deputy Speaker? Is it a requirement? If not, why is it not? Is it because we are so desperate that we accept all comers without first determining whether they have a real understanding of what it is to be an Australian citizen?
       </para>
       <para>
        Actually, the definition of citizenship course is most inaccurate. It is not about citizenship duties or prerequisites to become an Australian citizen. Rather, the citizenship course, as provided by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, appears to be an information service on how to make use of government services such as registering for unemployment, Medicare, sickness benefits, the first home owners scheme and other social security benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Migrating to this country is one issue. Learning to speak our language is another. But citizenship is really something quite different, separate and very special, and it is certainly not a step to be undertaken lightly. I am pleased to see that this legislation is opening up English language courses for newcomers to our country, but it should not be at the expense of migrants who have been here for some time and who have been working so hard that they have not had the time to do the courses or perhaps even have not had the knowledge that such courses exist or are available at no cost.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some 20 per cent of those participating in the adult migration education program have been in Australia more than five years. It is indeed commendable that the Government is expanding the range of people who wing down a report into literacy. I would foreshadow that that report will deal with courses on English as a second language. Everyone in this place should look forward with great expectation to receiving that report.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recent reports from the Bureau of Immigration Research suggest that problems in English language proficiency among migrants in the work force are costing Australia $763m a year. A study which was released in Canberra on 4 February this year said that about $134m was estimated to be lost in output and occupational health and safety costs because of people who spoke what is termed `poor' English. The report concluded that an overall improvement in English proficiency had the capacity to yield an estimated earnings increase of 6.5 per cent. It would appear that there is a very good case, purely on economic grounds, for migrants to undertake English classes to improve their language capability and consequently their incomes through increased productivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) emphasised in his delivery the value of English as a second language and the value of those courses for migrants. He talked to us about his appreciation of the courses and their value to our new citizens and to our country. I have no disagreement with the honourable member for Reid. It is clear that those people who come to this country without English as a first language have great need of English courses and literacy courses in order to be able effectively to participate in our society, to understand our literature, to have access to the legal profession, to have access to government programs and services and to understand our sometimes incomprehensible documentation and our incomprehensible forms, including taxation, social security, Austudy, et cetera.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Reid and I are one in agreeing on this issue. But there are only so many bickies in the barrel. There are only so many dollars and there are only so many people we can afford to train, or else some other program somewhere must suffer. We now have potentially between 20,000 and 40,000 extra people shoved into the system, so somebody suffers. It is either our Chinese students who suffer or it is new migrants from Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia-perhaps Jakarta-Germany, Austria or any country where English is not the first language. They are the ones who will suffer.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Reid went on to say it was hypocritical of the Opposition to talk about our interest in human rights in China regarding the refugees. I say to the honourable member for Reid that that is a lot of rot. My goodness, talk about hypocritical! Simply because the Opposition had the audacity to say that the Prime Minister went running off with the tear jerker again, he comes into this place and makes these statements. He has absolutely no idea what he is talking about; it is just something else to carry on with because he did not have enough time to fill up the speech. He did not make it as it was.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clear that the Opposition is not hypocritical at all. The Opposition has been clear and straightforward. It has told the Chinese students exactly where it stands with respect to this issue. So that is a lot of nonsense. This Bill is all about giving English language courses and citizenship courses to those Chinese-some 20,000 of them-that the Government said should stay here, or could stay here, because of the Tiananmen Square incident. That is terrific.
       </para>
       <para>
        On humanitarian grounds and on all humanitarian concerns I support the retention in Australia of those Chinese students who were under threat. But this legislation changes the eligibility for those courses. The financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum says:
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be no increase in Commonwealth appropriations as a result of the amendments made to the Act by this Bill. The cost of extending eligibility for the Adult Migrant Education Program to some classes of temporary entry permit holders will be met within the current appropriation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I question the validity of that statement. Surely it cannot be accurate. It is my understanding this week that English as a second language courses are not only fully subscribed but that migrants under the business migration scheme are really taking up their entitlements to these courses to the maximum.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would not deny any migrant the right to learn English in our country, but I must admit that I have to question why our business migrants, who have to come up-front with half a million dollars before they are accepted, and who, according to the press this week in Queensland, are dumped on the Gold Coast without any possibility of starting up a business without any assistance from the Department, have come without, it seems from the information that I have, any English as well. We have these great business migrants coming into Australia and we are going to teach them English-maybe-and boy are they taking up that entitlement. But when the hell are they going to start a business? I do not know; perhaps someone here does.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those in the business migration scheme need in excess of half a million dollars in assets and they have to set up a business within strict guidelines. One would expect that surely they had English before they came here. Is that wrong? I hear a lot of conversation on the other side of the House. Is it wrong to expect that they should have had English before they came here? Evidently not. I believe that their participation in the program is extremely high. The places are full of many migrants who need the program-they really need English as a second language-and are unable now to have access. Perhaps it should be a requirement for citizenship that applicants have a competent standard of English, that they undertake courses and that they are able to pass a test on Australian history, political institutions and the Constitution. I know that such a suggestion will be controversial, but Australian citizenship is highly valued by those swearing allegiance to the Queen. Our nation would be better served by citizens with good English language skills and an understanding of our history and political institutions. That is worth a thought.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Labor Government has demonstrated an absolute lack of principle in dealing with the students that we are discussing tonight. Back in June of 1989 we all saw our Prime Minister in tears over the dreadful massacre in Tiananmen Square. Then he announced that all Chinese students currently in Australia-about 20,000-would not be forced to return home against their will. Those who arrived after 20 June 1989-about another 20,000-were encouraged to apply to stay here on humanitarian grounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        What about the thousands of people around the world who were having their applications processed for migration as at June 1989? Were they also offered an extended visitors visa to come and live here for four years-`See if you like it; go home if you do not'? Where is the justice? Following hot on the heels of that fiasco, we had the announcement in July 1990 that these same special visa temporary residents would have access to almost the complete range of taxpayer funded Federal Government services. The Bill that we are debating tonight is being introduced to open up the adult migration education program to the queue jumpers while they are still visitors. To add insult to injury, in the same week that we are debating this amending legislation, the Government has decided to lift all remaining economic and political sanctions on China.

         —in reply-First, I want to thank those honourable members who took part in the debate, although a number of speakers paid little heed to the substance of the Immigration (Education) Amendment Bill and expressed a wide range of views, which I would be happy to debate at a more appropriate time. However, I will address some of the more outrageous comments made by honourable members. Even though this is a small Bill, with precise sets of words in it, one would have thought that honourable members opposite would have been able to grapple with it, but it seems that not many of them have read it. They have attributed to this Bill a whole range of issues which I can assure them are not reflected in the legislation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The point to remember is that people who will now become eligible must hold a temporary entry permit of a class specified by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs by notice published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. That is the key phrase. The shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), has returned to the chamber and that is good to see. I listened to his earlier comments, and I will refer to some of them in a moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The previous speaker, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), and a number of others, spoke about the financial impact and, of course, in the explanatory notes it talks about the current appropriation. It does not say, for argument's sake, that in the future funds will never be made available to pick up the increased demand which may flow out of the eligibility being provided for these people. There may be a range of people eligible for this, some of whom could be groups that the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations-of which the shadow Minister is a member-made recommendations to me about concerning arrangements for married folk, de factos, et cetera. Spouses could become eligible for something like this. People who are granted refugee status under the new arrangements will now become eligible because of this particular Bill. The Bill was a fulfilment of the promise made by me by way of an announcement in the press last year. I draw the attention of honourable members to the following paragraph on the second page:
       </para>
       <para>
        Access to the adult migrant education program would be given to all except those who had studied under English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        One assumes that they have gained English through that course. That was announced last year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member does not read his correspondence; that is the trouble. He comes in here and mouths off and, of course, he is not fully across the topic. A few cheap shots and away he goes, sending out the speech to the electorate. Some people in his electorate will be very interested to read his comments, I am sure, and we will probably all hear from them. A number of things were said about the People's Republic of China (PRC) students who were here on 20 June and those who came afterwards. Clearly, they are two quite distinct groups. That decision was made, contrary to the views expressed by the shadow Minister, after a lot of thought, weighing up a range of issues at the time which we are still prepared to stand by.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mentioned the fact that there are two groups, the first being those who were here prior to the cut-off date of 20 June. Clearly, one would have to say that most people in Australia at the time of Tiananmen Square and around that time-and I have said this before-really had to fight to get on a platform at any of the meetings held in the capital cities. It is a bit of a cheap shot to have a bit of a ping at the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) when one could have gone to any number of meetings around Australia where people displayed their emotions in a range of ways.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would also be fair to say that the community generally, and I include the media, would have left these people in no doubt as to what protection we were going to provide. At the meeting that I spoke at in the Melbourne Town Hall, all political parties were there, business leaders were there and trade union leaders were there, and all called for the protection of these people. It is all very well, as I said, to come in here and make these claims, but I put it to the honourable member that this was a decision based clearly on the needs of these people, then and still now. We do not back away from that decision at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sure that they will be interested to know that the shadow Minister talked about uncertainty. My God, when they read his speech they will become very uncertain as to their future-and no doubt they will read his speech. I think he has contributed most unfairly to this debate by making that threat about what will happen to them in the event of a change of government and his becoming a Minister, which is not likely to happen, thank God-and the Chinese people would be most grateful for that.

That is a quite different situation. There is quite clearly a difference in the situations of the two groups. That, I am sure, is known to both this side of the House and the Opposition side.

        The honourable member also talked about a range of other things. It is extraordinary that he said that he would go around Australia telling people that funding shortages or the lack of a service being provided in their region was caused by these PRC people. That is a very unfair thing to be saying to people. I hope that he does not say it, and I really do not think he will because I know him better, but he did say it here. I think it is most regrettable that he would use people in that way. We go again to the current appropriation.

        The honourable member also referred to the working party on post-secondary English language training. It is clear that he has not read the report. That working party served a valuable purpose by examining the situation and producing a report that has been widely circulated in the community and on which the community has been invited to comment. The report gives the users of the program a unique opportunity to comment to the two Ministers involved, namely, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and me, and I think that is a very solid approach. But the honourable member has in some way denigrated the report when, on any view of it, it could be claimed that it is not a bad report.

The Government recognised that the program needed examination; that has been done. It will have to be discussed by the Government in the not too distant future, and it will be. The Government is also giving the users of the program access to that process, which is something the Opposition did not do much of when it was in power. On that point, it is interesting to note that in the 1983 Budget $36m was allocated; last year $92m was allocated. This is the Government that the Opposition claims is not really interested in the program.

        The honourable member for Dundas referred to the Cambodian situation and implied that these people somehow were being disadvantaged. There is no group of people claiming to be refugees anywhere in the world who have been given more access to the processes than have the people who arrived on our shores. The first boatload of people are now housed in Sydney-26 people, 17 cases. This group made application and their assessments had been completed. However, the people who were advising them sought an undertaking from the Government that these submissions could be re-examined by the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales. Rather than face the prospect of there being any hint that people who had come here seeking refugee status were being denied their rights, I readily agreed to that-quite properly, I think. I was approached by representatives of the churches and other organisations with a request that the Legal Aid Commission review the applications just to ensure that all steps had been taken. That is now occurring.
       </para>
       <para>
        It takes an extraordinary amount of time to do the work involved in these cases, as the shadow Minister and others know. The interpreting problems, et cetera, that emerge will take time. These cases will be presented by 5 April this year. At this point none of the cases have been lodged.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of boat two, 123 people are in this group. There are 86 cases. Again, the work on applications is being done with a lot of community involvement. Again, the Government made sure that every single opportunity was given to these people to present their cases in the most detailed way. We are really talking about life. That has to be understood. That is why we have taken every precaution to ensure that people get proper access. This work has been done by the Refugee Advice Casework Service in Melbourne. To date, there are submissions covering 14 cases. As I said, there are 123 people and 86 cases. There will be five cases per week coming in between February and June.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third group comprises 79 people, who are in Darwin, and 55 cases. Honourable members will recall that we had these people housed in tents. I was seeking accommodation for them in other parts of the country. I met with an almighty coalition of forces in Darwin-the Catholic church, the Anglican church, the trade union movement, the business sector and the Northern Territory Government-who said that they should be allowed to remain in the Northern Territory. Again, we complied with that community wish. I think that some 25 lawyers in the Northern Territory came forward offering to carry out the work, which is-I repeat-very extensive in terms of people presenting their applications. I am advised by the lawyers that all applications from this group will be completed by 31 March.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the last couple of days two other boats have arrived here, their occupants seeking refugee status. There were 33 people on board the first boat. They are currently in Darwin, as is the second group of 35. It is premature for me to inform the House as to where these people come from. At this point they are claiming certain things. That is currently being investigated by the departmental officers dealing through interpreters. I raise that because it was implied that the Government was not approaching in a proper way the Cambodians and other people who have recently arrived. The world is changing quite dramatically in terms of the people arriving on our shores and in other countries. We here have certain obligations under international law to ensure that people get full access to our law and to what is able to happen under our law. That is why we are taking all this care to ensure that people are given access to their entitlements in relation to these applications.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude by saying that the Bill, whilst minor, generated a fairly wide debate. I have taken on board the comments made by honourable members on both sides of the House. I recognise that there is an increasing demand for the programs. Honourable members, when they go back to their electorates, can assure their constituents that I will be striving to take up the challenge to increase the services provided. I commend the interest shown by honourable members on both sides in what is a really worthwhile program for people to have access to. As a previous speaker said, this is important for people; in a country such as this their whole life can be affected by whether or not they have access to English. I could not agree more. We are striving to do that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Immigration (Education) Amendment Bill does provide access for people, but, I repeat, people who will be given access by gazettal, by their entitlement being gazetted. Some of the wider comments that have been made, such as those referring to the court case et cetera, I cannot address, but I would like to and will in the future.

         —I intend to make certain brief comments, if I may, because I am conscious that I am eating into the time of my colleagues and believe that that time should be devoted to the adjournment. I thank the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) for outlining the situation in relation to the Khmer Rouge. But let me make it very clear: at no stage did I imply that they were today being treated in an improper way.

        I thank the Minister for his comments tonight because they were important in clarifying the situation. But I do want to make this further point: the time that it is taking to make decisions in relation to the Khmer is, in my view, sending a wrong impression about the prospects of resettlement in Australia to those people overseas who may be contemplating making a very dangerous journey by sea. It is not a matter upon which there ought to be delay, and that is a point I have made elsewhere and will continue to make.

        The second point that the Minister did not deal with, which I simply want to point out very clearly, is the long term situation in relation to People's Republic of China (PRC) nationals pre-Tiananmen Square. I understand the distinctions very clearly in relation to the PRC students and PRC nationals in this country. The situation is that they have temporary residency only. If the Government intends permanency, it is a decision it could make today. If the Minister intends permanency, he could make that decision now. I do not believe that he wants to. Having regard to Senator Evans's comments about the situation in China, that is a matter that for those people needs to be clarified.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister can leave those people in limbo and make comments about what I have said. I do not resile from what I have said one iota. What I have said all along is that a case-by-case determination is the proper route to take. Those people who were here who may have had greater claims because they were pre-Tiananmen Square would have had that considered by those who considered each individual case-and that was the proper way to go. Again, we would not send anybody back who had a proper continuing claim for protection. But those who have no claim, in our view, have no entitlement, unless they meet the same criteria for permanency as any other applicant is able to satisfy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The only other matter that I want to deal with briefly-it is the only other point of contention-relates to appropriations. I know that governments like to keep appropriations and budgets in their own hands. But the fact is that as much as the Minister may seek to provide additional funds, in a Budget context next year fewer funds could be provided. That is what could happen. Simply to say that there may be the possibility in a new Budget context that there will be more funds ignores the obverse, which is equally clear, that there could be fewer funds. That happens in a Budget. The Minister knows more about the workings of finance than I do. The point is that the explanatory memorandum states:
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be no increase in Commonwealth appropriations-
       </para>
       <para>

        as a result of the amendments made to the Act by this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The financial impact statement made by the Minister in the explanatory memorandum tells us that there will be no increase in Commonwealth appropriations as a result of amendments made to the Act by this Bill. If the Minister is suggesting that there will be additional appropriations in some forthcoming Budget--

I am happy to talk to the honourable member for Dundas and the Opposition at any time about any way they may suggest could assist in the process. I would welcome their ideas; that is what this place is supposed to be all about. I have made that offer before. If they have any suggestion as to how we can protect the rights of people to the fullest and speed the process of getting that information together, getting it lodged, so that there is no interference with their rights, I would welcome that input. I say that to both sides of the chamber.

         —Yesterday in Question Time the Treasurer (Mr Keating) misrepresented me in statements that he made, inferring that I had made disparaging remarks about the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Some five hours after the Treasurer had misrepresented me I was permitted in this House to make a personal explanation. In making that personal explanation I was severely limited in what I could say in my defence. Tonight I want to elaborate further on that personal explanation.

       <para>
        The Treasurer sought to draw conclusions from an interview that I had made on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio with ABC interviewer Judy Tierney. That interview was conducted on 26 February 1991 in Hobart. For the information of the House, I wish to quote at greater length from that interview. I quote directly from the transcript that has been provided to me by the Parliamentary Library in Hobart:

       <para>
        MAX BURR Well the Liberal Party is performing very well, particularly under Dr Hewson. I think Dr Hewson, he is engendering a confidence, a hope that perhaps he might be able to lead the country into a better state of economic resurgence than what it is at the moment. I think that the present Labor Government has simply run out of steam, it has run out of ideas and clearly it's become lethargic as a government, so that the country is looking for a change in government, now Dr Hewson himself I think is at this stage stimulating a confidence in a hope for the future, but it hasn't been there for some considerable time . . .

       <para>
        If the Treasurer had had the honesty to read in full the comments that I made in the radio interview he would have given a totally different impression to this House than he tried to give. What amazes me is why the Treasurer of this country would seek to draw on a rather obscure interview by a humble backbencher to justify his claims here that there are some divisions among members on this side of the House.

He is prepared to hold onto his position for the sake of his own ego and to the detriment of this country and every person living in it. The Opposition has continually called for the resignation or the sacking of the Treasurer but, because he will not resign, because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will not sack him, he comes into this House and tries to use every obscure reason to create divisions in the Opposition.

He ought to produce a blueprint that he believes should be followed by this country for its economic resurgence rather than try to stimulate some divisions on the Opposition side.

        I remind the House that it is not the Opposition that is the Government of this country; it is those honourable members on the Treasury bench. They will not stimulate confidence in this country by trying to gain cheap political points. What we want and what the country wants is a blueprint for the economic recovery of this country. I believe very firmly that it is only Dr Hewson and the Liberal Party that will give the lead that this country desperately needs.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, as I said, the recent floods in the Gulf region of my electorate have created for my constituents untold stress and hardship which have been exacerbated for some by the disgraceful actions of a certain insurance company. This company has given new meaning to the term, `Kick them while they are down'.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The rain began in the Gulf of Carpentaria in early January and it is only in the past week or so that it has begun to ease. The communities of Normanton, Karumba, Burketown, Doomadgee and Mornington Island have been isolated for almost two months. As a result, the normal supply routes to these communities have been cut leaving the residents largely reliant on emergency supplies flown in by the State Emergency Service. The SES is to be commended on the service it has provided to these communities, but its job has been made more difficult by the lack of all-weather airstrips in the region. For example, the Mornington Island airstrip has been closed 14 times in the last two months.
       </para>
       <para>
        By mid-January there was a serious shortage of food and supplies available. I visited Normanton and Mornington Island about this time and the shelves in the supermarket were devoid of any fresh produce and milk, and supplies of other basic items such as sugar, flour and toilet paper were extremely low. In an attempt to relieve the situation the Mornington Island Shire Council, in conjunction with the local SES coordinator, organised for a sea barge to carry emergency supplies from Cairns to Karumba.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 30-metre flat bottomed barge, The Tasma, left Cairns on 22 January on the long voyage around Cape York and down to Karumba. However, the weather gods were determined to continue wreaking havoc. The barge overturned in heavy seas off Weipa. Thankfully, the four crew on board were rescued, but the entire cargo was lost. This was certainly a serious blow to the Gulf residents because their supplies and their morale were now at a critically low level.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, worse was to come for some local traders who had many thousands of dollars worth of goods now at the bottom of the ocean. They found, to their horror, that their insurance companies were unlikely to accept liability for the losses, because the goods were not insured for marine transport. While one can say that these traders should have checked with their insurance companies first, it needs to be remembered that this was all arranged under emergency conditions and that transit by sea was the only option available.
       </para>
       <para>
        There were some who did check their insurance policy and were relieved to note that the class of risk listed was `marine cargo'. I have a copy of one such policy in front of me. However, with certain insurance companies, nothing is as it seems and in this case `marine' has no nautical meaning at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        On behalf of one of my constituents, I have been dealing with one of the insurance companies in question, namely Lumley General Insurance Ltd of 199 Charlotte Street, Brisbane. As the facts will show, `charlatan' would be a more appropriate address in the circumstances. I have been shocked and dismayed at the attitude this company has taken. It has shown a complete lack of desire to assist its client in any way in this emergency situation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have in front of me a copy of a letter in which Lumley General Insurance has formally denied liability for the loss. It states that my constituent's policy only covered goods transported by road. But as I said earlier, all roads were under water. Unbelievably, however, Lumley's has had the temerity to deny liability without a formal claim even being submitted. It has even refused to issue my constituent with a claim form. I have been told in no uncertain terms by Lumley General Insurance that, `This is the end of the story'. However, I disagree and I am determined to ensure that this in fact is just the beginning of the story.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of other insurance companies that have clients in similar situations have issued claim forms and are investigating the same. While the final outcome of these claims is unknown, it has been indicated that the insurance companies do recognise that their clients were operating under emergency circumstances and that the claims should be assessed accordingly.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do hope that these companies recognise their moral obligation and that they accept liability. I refer here specifically to Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Australia) Ltd and the AMP Society. I call on them not to take the same approach as Lumley General Insurance. I ask the House: what is the use of an insurance company that makes general propositions to clients and then relies on cute legalisms in an attempt to avoid its moral obligations?
       </para>
       <para>
        Basically, Lumley General Insurance is saying that `If you want to test our ruling, then you spend more of your hard earned money and take us to court'. These types of insurance company should be closely examined by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) as to their fitness to be involved in the insurance industry. If this is the approach Lumley Insurance takes--

         —I generally try to refrain from raising in the House parochial matters concerning my electorate, but I am deeply distressed by the matter which I would like to raise tonight. It concerns the town of Bulahdelah situated on the Pacific Highway within my electorate. In the town there is a volunteer bush fire brigade and a volunteer rescue association.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Recently these organisations acquired telefinder pagers from Telecom Australia so that they could contact each other in cases of emergency. They now find that the pagers fail to operate simply because there is need for a telefinder repeater in the area of the township. The township has a population in excess of 1,000 people. It is a large farming area with a timber industry, dairy industry and grazing industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        In making a decision to reject this town's request for a repeater station, Telecom Australia has neglected to recognise the fact that this town is situated on a busy highway. Practically all the calls that these voluntary organisations receive are reports of accidents on the highway, involving people who do not even reside in the district. They certainly receive a couple of such calls every week. The situation is always urgent. The organisations are notified by the police to attend the accident immediately. They save people's lives. I know a few people who have been saved because of the work of these organisations. But now they find that their pagers cannot operate properly.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have made representations on behalf of these organisations. Telecom Australia admits that they should not have been sold the pagers and it has offered to refund their money.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not the point. Whilst I recognise that Telecom Australia is a corporate body, surely to goodness it can bend a little to supply telephone repeaters to two voluntary organisations, each with 14 or 15 people active in them. The organisations were talking to me only the other day, and I totally agree with the complaint they have that they are entitled to this equipment. They are doing a virtually national job upon a busy highway-the Pacific Highway-which is inadequate to meet the great demands of the traffic in that area. It is mountainous land and there is often an accident there. Undoubtedly, something has to be done to assist them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am wondering whether the Minister, who was in the House last night at this time, may be prepared to lean a little upon Telecom Australia and to point out to it how necessary it is that these voluntary workers, saving the lives of many people year in year out, should receive their telephone repeater, which can be easily located within the area to give the service. They have also pointed out to me that, when the people who have pagers are travelling through areas such as Newcastle and the Taree-Forster area nearby, they are unable to use them because of the poor reception. I raise the matter here because I am very concerned about it. I have a sympathy for the people concerned and for the work they have done, as I said earlier, from a voluntary point of view. I ask the Minister to try to assist the people concerned.

         —I wish to raise a matter which is of very serious concern to me and my electorate. Over recent times there have been a number of activities in my electorate which are designed to cover up what I would suggest is a case of gross mismanagement of community funds. Everyone from our area, and everyone in Victoria, is aware of the situation which preceded and followed the collapse of the Pyramid Building Society and the Farrow group. There has been a concerted campaign, largely headed by a public relations firm which is very close to the Victorian Liberal Party, I might say, designed to cover up what happened.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What happened to those building societies was that their management was inept and incompetent-there is no other word for it. The people who were running the societies used their positions of trust to take risks with the savings of ordinary people, with the result that those savings were lost. It is a very serious situation and one which I find of concern, even more so because there has been a concerted effort to cash in politically on the problems which have confronted the people who have lost their savings.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the first days after the collapse, the Liberal Party of Australia made it absolutely clear that it did not believe the Government should underwrite such organisations, nor should governments be responsible to guarantee funds. Since that time, a gentleman named Lucas in Geelong, who has twice been an unsuccessful Liberal Party campaigner and is seeking preselection again, has made a series of statements which are totally unacceptable in their standards and in their moral content and are designed to exploit the situation for political purposes. I find that quite objectionable. The Pyramid Building Society, I repeat, collapsed because of problems associated with inept management-

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) No. In the ALP policy launch on 8 March 1990 the Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, committed the Government to an extension of marriage counselling and related services. The sum of $15m was not mentioned. However, the Prime Minister did commit a total of $128m over three years to a range of proposals to deal with crises in people's lives which included the marriage counselling funds.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) The Report of the Australian Institute of Family Studies was launched in June 1990 and its recommendations have not yet been fully considered. However the Government has set in train a number of initiatives in this context:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) a number of meetings have been held between peak bodies representing Marriage Counselling organisations and officers from the Attorney-General's Department to establish the needs of clients and the best way in which organisations, with the assistance of the Government, can address those needs. These discussions have included the question of the most cost effective ways of addressing the needs of rural and remote Australia;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) a mapping exercise is underway to determine those areas most in need of counselling services. When this has been determined, the Government will be able to expand services more equitably than has been the case in the past and more effectively use the limited funds available;
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) mindful of the limits on the available funds, the Government is also taking steps to place an emphasis on the quality of the services provided and to put in place financial controls to ensure that funds are expended in such a way that the maximum benefits are achieved;
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (b) Guidelines for organisations seeking approval to conduct programs of Marriage Counselling, Family Mediation, Marriage Education, Adolescent Mediation and Family Therapy are available for organisations seeking funding. Copies of these Guidelines are available from my Department.

       A further $0.760m was set aside for administration, with $0.440m remaining unallocated. The additional funding in 1990/91 has been used to augment existing services. A decision on the allocation of the additional funding available in 1991/92 and 1992/93 has not yet been made.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (d) At the present time funding of the services provided by organisations is on a cost reimbursement basis of up to 75% of the amount expended. As part of the review of the manner in which the Program funds services, the funding formula is to be assessed for effectiveness and may be amended.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (e) As agencies are funded on a cost reimbursement basis, it is feasible that agencies providing identical services but incurring different levels of costs may receive different levels of funding.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (i) Some church organisations have lower costs because of their greater use of volunteer labour and access to church owned facilities. Since funding is on a cost reimbursement basis, funding levels will reflect such lower costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Not applicable-church affiliation is not a criterion in relation to funding.

       NOTES:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Actual exports differ from statistics on applications resulting in a permit because sales do not always proceed after approvals have been granted or some deliveries are yet to be made.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) These statistics do not include applications relating to temporary ``exports'' such as returns sent to Australia for repair, goods returned for warranty reasons or goods exported for demonstration reasons. Such applications will add another $81m to the 1989-90 total for approved applications.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Approvals resulting in exports are those for which documentary proof of export has been received.
