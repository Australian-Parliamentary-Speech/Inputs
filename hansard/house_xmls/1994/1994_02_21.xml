         —The Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994 proposes to amend the Telecommunications Act 1991 to ensure regional, rural and remote Australians have access to telecommunications of a standard available to the majority of people in Australia—a simple enough aim, yet one ignored in the current legislation and by this government. If a telephone is considered an essential service in metropolitan communities, it must be judged indispensable in rural and remote communities. However, gross inequities lie in the provision of telecommunications services between urban and rural centres. No formal mechanism exists to ensure telecommunications in rural areas keep pace with services accessible to metropolitan regions. In fact, there is a very real fear that service levels will deteriorate in rural Australia as a direct result of competition.

         The federal government must be made to honour its responsibility to provide equitable access to information services. Communications are the technological highways to future development in rural and remote Australia. Rural and regional communities will face new threats to their viability if they cannot keep pace with businesses in the national and global economy. This is the gloomy prospect facing many rural and regional communities, given the government's vague determination of the obligation under the Telecommunications Act 1991 to provide a standard telephone service to all people in Australia on an equitable basis.

         Section 288 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 embodies the principle that all Australians are entitled to have reasonable access to a standard telephone service and to pay phones. The obligation to provide a standard telephone services fails at the very point of definition. In section 5 of the act the standard telephone service is defined as a public switched telephone service; in other words, a basic service. However, the basic service provided in urban areas far exceeds the basic service provided in rural and remote areas.

         Furthermore, the USO makes no provision for enhancing telecommunication services in rural and remote areas when access to improved technology becomes generally available in metropolitan areas. While the basic telephone has reached 95 per cent of Australian households, the service quality in urban areas surpasses that realised in rural areas. Analog systems are still in operation throughout rural areas which in effect deny reliable transmission of facsimile, computer or other data. A significant number of digital radio concentrator systems, the predominant rural telecommunications medium, suffer a high incidence of capacity related technical reduction in quality of service, including the lack of service, dropping-out and noisy lines.

         Further, services unavailable to the bush include caller line identification and itemised billing. Local call access to essential services and communities of interest is unavailable to many remote households. As these examples clearly illustrate, the standard service in country areas does not equate to the standard service in urban regions. It can therefore be argued that in some areas service quality is such that Telecom's universal service obligation is not being met. If such obligations are not being met now, there seems very little hope that rural telephone systems will accommodate the information services of the future.

         The standard telephone service as defined in the act will become increasingly irrelevant in today's information and technological age. The definition must be updated to ensure rural and remote areas have access to a standard of service comparable with the standard of service available to the majority of people in Australia. This bill makes the necessary update. The amendment also provides that if a definition is to be set by regulation the standard or standards so determined must ensure that the standards of service are comparable across Australia.

         The proposed amendment to section 38 of the principal act deals with Austel's general functions and would require that indicative performance standards recognise that services of similar standards should be available to all people of Australia. The proposed amendments to section 246 dealing with technical standards would impose a new paragraph (b) to provide for similar standards for all people. The other provisions of section of 246 would remain, that is, subsections (1), (3), (4) and (5). The proposed new section 246(A) would allow the minister to give direction to Austel about the performance of its functions in relation to section 246. This is consistent with the ability of the minister to give directions to Austel.

         The definition of a standard telephone service now in the act can be changed by regulation. However, given that no such regulations have been prescribed, the introduction of this private members' bill aims to trigger the necessary change. Governments should not shirk from the responsibility of providing equitable and affordable access to information services. The vast nature of the Australian continent demands governments play a role in the provision of service equity. The Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994 challenges the government to maintain and improve regional and rural telecommunications. I present the explanatory memorandum.

       Mr Speaker, next week coalminers from Queensland and New South Wales will assemble outside Parliament House to bring to the attention of honourable members and the Australian public the threats to the export coal industry. We hear the phrase `history never repeats itself'. I can assure the House that history does repeat itself in so far as the Australian coal owners are concerned. The periodical negotiations with Japanese coal buyers over the price of coal are a permanent reminder of history constantly being repeated and for this the Australian economy and taxpayer pay a price.

        Mr Speaker, as you would know more than most, coming from the Illawarra, it is with monotonous regularity that Australian coal owners, after negotiating with Japanese coal buyers, return to this country and announce that they have had to accept reduced prices. What happens, as honourable members would be aware, is that the Australian coal producers go to Japan, are holed up in a hotel somewhere in Tokyo, and are invited to come in individually and negotiate with a centralised Japanese buying authority. When it is discovered that one of the coal owners has caved in—last time it was BHP—there is a weak link in the chain. The price of that first producer is forced down and then there is a great scramble of producers who want to get volume share of the market.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Recently, though, not only was there a reduction in the price but also there was a reduction in the volume. In the past when there has been a reduction in the price by increased volume they can make up that shortfall in the price, but this time there was a reduction not only in the price but also in the volume. The producers return from these pilgrimages to Japan, wring their hands and proclaim piously, `Unfortunately, this is the best deal we were able to achieve given the circumstances', and they then proceed to give us chapter and verse the reasons why.

        It is nothing short of amazing that these selfsame coal owners are the most stubborn, hardnosed, intransigent of negotiators when it comes to dealing with their own employee trade unions and also, I might add, various Australian governments, both state and federal, which have in the past bent over backwards to accommodate them. The outcome of the coal owners latest round of negotiations with Japanese buyers will have a horrendous effect on Australian export earnings. As I said before, when there is a drop in the price there is usually an increase in the volume, but this time we have seen both a drop in the price and a drop in the volume.

        This will mean that something like $500 million of this country's export income will be wiped out without any regard to the consequences not only for the industry itself but for the country as a whole. It is time we accepted the proposition that coalmining and the production of coal in this country is too important to our economy to be left to the producers, who have abysmally failed to show they are able to control this industry. They trot out feeble excuses and they claim, `This is what the market can stand; the Japanese economy is such that we are forced to accept lower prices for our coal'. During the boom times in Japan, I never once heard a coal producer return from Japan and say, `Because of the booming Japanese economy, the buyers have given us higher prices for our coal'. Never once did they say that.

        The significance of coal exports to the Australian economy cannot be overestimated. Coal is our most important export earner. The pussyfooting approach that coal producers adopt when confronted by united Japanese negotiation teams cannot be allowed to continue any longer. From April this year Japanese steel mills will be paying an average price of $44.90 per tonne for our coal—a shameful 12 per cent reduction in the benchmark price of coking coal. In terms of Japanese currency, this means that Japanese steel producers are today paying only 36.7 per cent of what they were paying a decade ago. The price then was $52.52 per tonne, which was equivalent to Y12,475. Today they pay Y4,853 per tonne.

        What is the response of coal owners to this sell-out to Japanese buyers? They demand increased productivity and more sacrifices from Australian mineworkers and threaten more closures. This cry is echoed by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), the opposition spokesman on resources. In articles in the daily commercial news—I refer to one in particular that I have seen recently in the

I invite the honourable member for Gippsland to come with me to the Illawarra and, in front of a meeting of coalminers in the Wollongong showground, repeat some of the nonsense that he is saying. Mr Speaker and I have both attended those meetings. I invite the honourable member to come along and put his proposition there or to come with Mr Speaker or me to one of the pits in the area. We will take the honourable member down the pit. The statements that he is making show he knows absolutely nothing about coalmining in this country and the conditions that the miners work under. As I say, that is a standing invitation to the honourable member for Gippsland to come to the next rally at the Wollongong showground—it is quite a sobering experience, as we all appreciate—or, if he does not really want to go to the showground, I invite him to come with us to one of the pits in the area.

        The coalminers have accepted changed work practices, retrenchments, relocation and mine closures in order to obtain greater productivity and efficiency in their industry. They have also accepted them in the so far vain hope that these miners who remain in the industry will have some long-term security of employment. They have made the Australian coal industry a world leader in its field, and this should be duly recognised by us all. The coalminers' efforts to bring stability to the industry and better job security for mineworkers is being placed in jeopardy by the actions of the mine owners who have kowtowed once more to the Japanese. This latest round brings forth calls by the owners for greater sacrifices by their employees and the threat of more closures, increases in productivity by reducing working conditions and the lowering of safety standards—standards, I might add, that were forced on the employers by the miners and the courts.

For too long mine owners have shown that they cannot be trusted to ensure that the interests of the nation as well as the needs of the industry are adequately served. The time is long overdue for a national coal authority. The industry, as I have said before, is too important to be left to the producers. Under a national coal authority—

The workers in the industry should have a security of employment which they deserve and have lacked to the present day. The only way that we can guarantee the future stability of the coal industry in this country is to have a national coal authority.

        —In responding to the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), I will take the second point of his motion first—the recognition of the importance of coal exports to the economy. My electorate of Hinkler spans the south-eastern flank of Central Queensland's famous Bowen Basin and includes the mining town of Moura. When coal was discovered there last century it took some time for its production to be developed; interestingly, it was under a National Party government—the one that my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) is so ready to give a touch up. In the early 1960s, Utah and later BHP developed this field. A trial shipment of highly volatile coal from Moura to the emerging Japanese steel mills in 1959 kick-started three phenomenal decades of coal industry expansion in central Queensland. Coal production in the Bowen Basin now totals 75 million tonnes annually.

This is clearly evidenced by the development of power stations, railway lines, ports and other infrastructure. Most of the new towns in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) would not be there were it not for the Queensland National Party government and its kick-starting of open-cut coalmining in this country.

        I remind the honourable member for Throsby and, in anticipation, the honourable member for Gilmore that it was the same National Party government that pioneered modern resource development that took place in Queensland and, for that matter, in the rest of Australia. I will cite a few examples: development of the first commercial oilfield, construction of the first oil pipeline, construction of the first gas pipeline, first commercial use of natural gas, development of Weipa, the birth of the export coal industry and development of Australia's largest open-cut mine.

When that did not work, they took a 180-degree turn and said, `Well, we were making too much money for the state Treasury out of coal freights'.

        As for export prices, the matter is pretty simple. The signals have been going out for six months or more that Japanese steel production would drop from 108 million tonnes to 95 to 97 million tonnes in the coming year. To some extent, that has been offset by sales to China but these will not be available in the coming year. Add to that the problems of the Japanese economy and the uncertainty of its political stability and we have a problem.

With major depreciation in the Canadian dollar that country saw its salvation in tonnage contracts sharply undercutting nations like our own. Australia was faced with Japanese buyers being offered a cut of $5 a tonne to take Canadian coal. It has been the philosophy of the Australian coal industry—and I would like the honourable member for Throsby to listen to this—to maintain market share and tonnage to keep mines close to production capacity and to be ready to benefit when prices recover.

There is no proper way that taxpayers would tolerate the cost of stockpiling coal until the proper price was received.

        Finally, I would like to talk about the effects of the government's economy on the coalmining industry. The New South Wales Coal Association estimated that the government's 3c a litre rise in diesel excise—going up to 5c a litre by next August—will cost that industry $3 million per annum. The total amount paid by the New South Wales coal industry in diesel fuel excise is now $30 million. In my electorate, Moura is 184 kilometres from Gladstone. The diesel trains use 5.5 million litres of diesel per annum. This increase, by August, will increase the operations of that line per year by $275,000, giving a total excise bill for that coal line of $1.7 million.

Now they are belly-aching because the coal mines are not efficient. We cannot compete internationally because jobs are at risk. As honourable members know, jobs are going to be mostly at risk in the less efficient areas of the Hunter and the Illawarra. I have no doubt that those opposite are here today defending their position because, if they do not, they will be at electoral risk. This motion is little more than crocodile tears and shows a very poor appreciation of international trade and very little vision and understanding of the role of Australian mining companies in the Australian economy.

It was said in an earlier speech on this subject that the coal producers in this country have bent over backwards to support the Japanese steel merchants.

       Since price negotiations for the fiscal 1988 coal shipment, Japanese industry, led mainly by the electric power industry, has been endeavouring to lower the approximately 70% share of Japan's coal imports held by Australia and diversify its coal supply sources, but there is only a small chance that their efforts will be rewarded in the near future and that a leading coal supplier that can challenge Australia's hold on the market will appear. Therefore, to raise the steam coal supply capacity, Japan will have to maintain its basic direction of increasing the supply capacity of Australian coal as the primary source, while adopting concrete measures to increase the supply capacity of the other coal exporting countries. The expected tightening of steam coal supply and demand in Asia from now on makes adopting special measures that conform to the situation in each of the coal exporting countries even more important, and it is hoped that by doing this, industry can ease the pressure on the steam coal market and keep coal prices down.

       The reality is that the Japanese have been manipulating the market. In one part of the paper the IEE suggests that Japan should invest heavily in infrastructure for the Chinese coal industry so that China will not import Australian coal in the future, so as to artificially reduce the price of our coal. If those opposite do not recognise that and do not know about that, then perhaps they should take the bags off their heads and take a look. The reality is that we are being done over and done over badly.

With the recession in Japan and the competitive threats from Canadian producers, the choices were fairly limited for the Australian producers and government. Without doubt, Australia's coal producers have been among the world's leaders in getting their basic business into shape in the last few years. They have been more responsive to customer needs and have already secured strong market shares in Asia which, without doubt, in the next two to three decades will be the world's key growth market for bulk commodities such as iron ore and coal.

        A lot of the problems we are talking about today stems from the government's so-called industrial reform package of last year which did not address the situation in the coal industry. In particular, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has left a lot to be desired in the area of industrial relations reform of the coal industry. The Coal Industry Tribunal is archaic. It has been around for too long. I think it came into existence in 1946. It has existed outside mainstream industrial relations for way too long as well.

        The fact is that coal is not a high demand product at the moment, but this is cyclical and a return to better times must be expected. It is therefore a perfect time to continue with the efficiency drive so that, when the good times do come, the profits can be maximised. A coal marketing authority will do nothing for the industry. I believe that the Coal Industry Tribunal certainly has no role to play in the export price negotiation field, which really should be dominated by coal producers with very little government interference.

The shadow minister for resources and energy, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), has already clearly stated that such industrial action causes severe damage to the industry.

        The main argument I would therefore like to put to the House today is that, as the coal industry is facing stiffer competition in 1994 than ever before, if we are going to protect our markets it is vital that we are reactive to this competition.

We have to send a clear message to Japan that we are not totally reliant on its market, and we are not going to be totally at the behest of the way it wants to set the pricing structure. It comes down to supply and demand. But as the honourable member for Gilmore said, we cannot just stick our heads in the sand, leave the coal in the ground, and expect all those people to still be employed—20,000-plus people.

       Still the creation of a de facto national coal authority is a very real threat. The Coal Industry Tribunal (CIT) is considering issues raised by a coal strike last September over the issue of a low-priced contract to supply coal to Turkey. The tribunal was set up in 1946 when coal was in short supply and demand was soaring. Three major reviews in the past 10 years have recommended its abolition, but the CIT continues to operate as though coal was a strategic industry warranting its own industrial relations system. And herein lies the loophole. If CIT decides that coal marketing is an industrial relations issue because it affects job security, it effectively will be claiming a role for itself as a marketing authority.

I believe that it also has the support of the overwhelming majority of members of this chamber and senators who either directly represent coalmining areas or who have some association with them. This motion is not preoccupied with marketing, although that issue is presently of the utmost concern—for good reason. This motion raises questions about the management of Australia's coal reserves, employment and investment, the impact which Japanese investment is having in the industry on the negotiation of contract prices and contract tonnages, and the need for Australia to exercise an appropriate overseeing or surveillance of an industry which provides us with the greatest amount of export earnings of any single industry in Australia.

        We have been through this before. In 1988 there was a shake-out in the industry and about 23 coalmines closed. The coal represented by those closures has been sterilised now and probably lost forever. Australia is the biggest single exporter of coal in the world; we provide about 60 per cent of the total amount of coal which enters into world seaborne trade. So the coal industry is important for Australia. It is also important for employment—investment in the industry—and for regional Australia. It is important to my constituents as it is to the constituents of the honourable member for Throsby, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) and other honourable members.

        This is not just a recent concern. In May 1979 Stewart West, the former member for Cunningham, told the parliament that recent coal export negotiations had resembled the Mad Hatter's tea party. There has not been much improvement. Sometimes it is the small producer exporters who drive the market down and the large exporters complain. This time it is the large exporters, such as BHP, which have allowed the prices to dip and the smaller producers are complaining about the impact. It is not so many years ago that the smaller producers, in selling coal to the Japanese, allowed the prices to dip to the extent that they did.

        We cannot expect any support from the states on questions of this kind because their royalties are collected on a tonnage basis, so it matters little to them what prices they sell for.

        The situation we now have as a result of safeguards that have been built into the system by this government is better than it was in the late 1970s. But, as a result of competitive negotiations which have taken place in Japan, we still have coal price reductions of between eight and 12 per cent. That will translate into something like $350 million in lost export earnings for Australia. If we add to that an equivalent reduction in the price of steaming coal—about another $150 million—it means we lose a total of $500 million in coal export earnings. If that is then used as a lever, as it is now being used by Japanese iron ore importers, we stand to lose another $230 million in export earnings. We could lose almost three-quarters of a billion dollars in export earnings for two of our major exports as a result of insufficient overseeing to ensure that appropriate prices are achieved.

       Without proper transport facilities in Australia, primary industry, manufacturing and tourism industries cannot function to their full potential. The network of highways and roads around Australia is a major part of those transport facilities.

        At the same time as the federal government has cut road funding, its collections from fuel excise have risen dramatically. In this process, the ratio between the excise collections and the amount of Commonwealth road funding has deteriorated badly. In 1982-83, fuel excise drew $1,364 million and road funding was $850 million—in other words, 62.4 per cent of excise collections. In the 1993-94 budget, fuel excise collections are estimated at $8,379 million against a federal road funding outlay of only $1,013 million, or about 12.1 per cent—an absolute disgrace.

It is home to Australian Defence Industries' heavy engineering plant and will soon be home to a major aluminium rolling mill. So a great deal of traffic—from heavy freight trucks to tourists and people travelling to and from Tullamarine airport—uses the Calder Highway, yet the federal government continually refuses to give this major transport route the status and funding of a national highway.

Today cars and trucks use this route at speeds of up to 100 kilometres an hour when much of the road is probably now no safer than it was 140 years ago, the only difference being it has a sealed surface. Work is being carried out on the Calder Highway. Various duplications and bypass stages have either been completed or are approaching completion.

I have heard the honourable member for Charlton speak on this issue many times. I note now that the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) has come into the chamber. He would be aware of the need for greater infrastructure development of Australia's highways and the need for greater involvement of the Commonwealth in providing funds into that area.

        The Calder Highway, as I said, is a major part of that national highway structure but, because of the government's inaction on this, it has not been characterised as having  national highway status and it does not attract federal funding. The federal government must act to ensure that the Calder Highway is given the funding and the national status that it needs to reduce not only the death toll and the carnage but also the economic benefits that can be attributed directly to the upgrading of that highway to a national status. I mention all of the areas in tourism, manufacturing and primary industry. It is one of the most productive areas in Australia to the north of Bendigo, including all of the Sunraysia area. I understand my colleague the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) will be speaking in support of this motion. He would be aware of the massive input into the Australian economy which derives from the Sunraysia area.

        —I am saddened by the comments made by the previous speaker, my colleague and good friend the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). In this case he has brought to the notice of the chamber a very important issue—the Australian road transport infrastructure and the need to improve it. He pointed out the needs of primary industry, manufacturing and tourism, which industries will enhance Australia's export performance—I think everybody would agree with that. It is all a matter of how much we can spend at any one time.

        The large part of the argument that he put is quite spurious. He and his colleagues are well aware of that. He first dealt with a comparison of federal fuel excises. That kind of comparison is like comparing apples with oranges and it completely misrepresents the position. He said that in 1982-83 some $1,364 million was collected in federal fuel excise of which some 62 per cent was spent by the federal government on roads—I will not dispute the accuracy of his figures. He compares that with the $8,379 million being collected in 1993-94 in federal fuel excise and only $1,013 million of that being spent on roads by the federal government.

        Let me say right at the beginning—and this is where the spurious nature of this proposition is so clear—the crude oil levy was established by a previous conservative government, the title and the arrangements mechanisms were changed and it all became lumped together under the one heading of federal fuel excise. So it was a matter of substituting names to a large extent. The large bulk of money being collected by crude oil levy became known and is now known as federal fuel excise.

        To make that sort of comparison also ignores the fact that there is a considerable change in road responsibilities. He said that the road effort of the federal government over the past 10 years is appalling. Let me counter that argument with this: in the decade to 1992-93, some $11,973 million has been spent by this government on road improvements in this nation. In no decade in the history of this federation has such an amount of money been spent. We say quite proudly that more has been done by this federal government in that decade from 1982-83 to 1992-93 to improve roads in this nation than has been done in any other decade in the history of this country. So let us put aside the crocodile tears and the misrepresentations about that.

        In 1991 Prime Minister Hawke and the Premiers agreed on a new sharing of road responsibilities. At that Special Premiers Conference it was decided that the federal government from this year on would contain its funds and spend its money only on the national highway system. That national highway system was expanded to include the Newell Highway in New South Wales north to Brisbane, and the Sturt Highway west across New South Wales as a Sydney-Adelaide route. That was not a decision by this government; it was a decision made at a Special Premiers Conference, of which the Victorian government was a part and which everybody in this chamber knows about.

        To compare the reduced federal expenditure because we now have responsibility only for national highways and our money is tailing down with expenditure or collection of excise is again a comparison of apples with oranges. It totally misrepresents the situation. I am saddened, as I said in my opening words, that my good friend and colleague, who has represented Australia well with me, would advance that kind of misrepresentation. He knows what the truth is and his colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) knows what the truth is and he will tell us when he speaks later. The figures cannot be disputed.

        There is a joint responsibility in building and maintaining roads in this country. Federal government is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the national highway system. State government is responsible for all of the main road systems and arterial roads other than local roads, which are the responsibility of local government. As we withdraw earmarked funding for the states for arterial roads, that money goes to the states as part of their general revenue grant. They can do what they like with it. They can spend it on roads. They can spend it on something else. We would like them to spend it on roads. Some of the states have siphoned off the money. I think in New South Wales already some $50 million of the roads money has been siphoned off to railways. It is very difficult to verify, but my understanding is that the Victorian government has siphoned off some $100 million of federal money from roads. But that is a decision for the state.

        Let us look at this excise issue. Excise is a form of indirect tax of general revenue. What do we do with it? Part of it is earmarked, under the new arrangements, for expenditure on roads. Obviously it can be said that the money from federal government that goes to our national highway system comes out of fuel excise. Part of it goes to paying for hospitals, schools and defence. The major part of it goes to the state governments with no strings attached. The state and territory governments can spend it as they wish on the priorities that they determine.

        State and territory governments constantly tell Canberra that they know best how to spend money on roads, general services and transport infrastructure. The state, if it wishes, can add money to its own resources or spend whatever portion it wants of that general revenue grant, which includes federal excise, on any projects it wishes. It is a decision for the state or territory government concerned. Building and maintaining roads is a joint responsibility.

        The House Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure recently completed a report on the efficiency and performance of the road building and road maintenance industry. The committee found, incredibly, that there was an absolute paucity of hard information on how road money has been spent in this country. We encapsulated it in these few words:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Never has so much money been spent by so many people, for so long, with so little information gathered and analyses carried out on how well the money is used.

       It is not just a matter of how much money we spend on transport infrastructure; it is a matter of how well we spend it and what priorities we attach to the building projects. Now, for the first time in the history of federation, a system is under way to find out from local governments the value of their road systems at the end of each financial year, what money would need to be spent to bring the roads up to tip top condition, and what money they are proposing to spend in the current financial year. That is all being collated by the National Road Transport Commission.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Again, there is an absolute paucity of information. A few councils have some idea. We went through the whole program. We found that the inefficiencies associated with road building and road maintenance were very much a matter of the stop go nature of road funding. The taps are turned on; the taps are turned off. There are long administrative delays between state governments and us. There is the budgetary timing in this place. Then there are delays from the states to their sources; states to local government; states to divisional road engineers; and all the way down to district engineers. These are all administrative problems affecting the efficiency of how money is spent on roads. There is the poor timing, the poor planning, the lack of coordination in road programs, the inadequate utilisation of expensive road plant and the smallness of some road projects.

        The important issue is to make sure that we spend the money as efficiently as possible and we spend it in the right places for the right reasons. As a federal government, we have done more in this decade up to 1992-93 to improve our road system in this country than has been done in any other comparable decade in the history of this federation.

        Let us look at what really happened. While there was a change in the crude oil levy, he did not tell us that that did not excuse the government for repeatedly cutting the amount of excise that was going towards roads. We ought to look at the facts. The change to the taxation of fuel was made in 1985. For most years after that, the amount of money going into roads declined significantly while at the same time the amount of money that was being collected in fuel excise rose.

In fact, many more useful things would have come out of it if it had not been for the activities of the current Prime Minister. Again, the facts show very clearly that the government is still increasing fuel tax. We have just seen the latest budget efforts. Where is the increase to road funding? Where is the increase to the states for their road funding? Where is the increase to local government for its road funding? The answer is that the Commonwealth is just pocketing it. The situation now is that about 1c in every 8c that is collected from motorists is going back into road funding.

        This government has an appalling record. I do not believe that this last decade is the one when the most effort was put into roads. As I recall it, many more roads were built in the 1960s than in the last decade. The government has an appalling record in terms of its taxation of the road transport industry and motorists. It has an appalling record in its whole basic neglect of road infrastructure and the way that money has been spent. While I fully endorse what the honourable member for Shortland has pointed out, I find it incredible that it took all these years for the government to realise just how much money was being wasted.

        —I thank the House. The other point that really ought to be emphasised—which my colleague the honourable member for Bendigo did—is the importance of investment in infrastructure. Some excellent work has been done to show that it is important not only from the point of view of developing the nation but also because for every $1 billion that we invest—some work was done by the Australian Automobile Association—we show a very good return on it. Some work reported by Mr John Cox shows that, for every $1 billion invested, we increase private sector output by $880 million. That in itself shows that the government has a very sad record in not recognising the importance of this investment and the priority that it should have.

        The honourable member for Bendigo knows that the Calder Highway is not part of the national highway, which is the responsibility of the national government. He indicated that he knows that the present Victorian government, which is made up of the same political party to which he belongs, will not be putting the type of funding into the Calder Highway which that highway obviously needs. Significant allocations of funds were made to the Calder Highway under our national arterial program, because it was identified as being in that network. As the honourable member is aware, supplementary funds were made available to the Calder Highway under the provincial cities and rural highways program. The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), together with the Calder Highway committee, has always been a very strong advocate for increased funding for the Calder Highway.

        This is an important road and I would hope that the Victorian government will recognise its importance. I have no doubt that the honourable member for Bendigo, as a result of his genuine concern, will be in touch with his colleagues in the Victorian government and draw their attention to the inadequacies which persist with that highway. He should also draw their attention to the fact that this year we, at the request of Victoria and the other states—I emphasise that it was at their request—untied $300 million of what had previously been earmarked for road funds. We handed it back to the states. We said to them, `Look, as a responsible level of government in Australia, we have no doubt that you will use those funds properly. They were road funds. You wanted them untied. You wanted the opportunity to exercise your own discretion in connection with the use of those funds'.

        The states did exercise their discretion—as soon as we untied the funds they took them out of roads. In New South Wales, the total which went out of road funding was $50 million. I think it was even more in Victoria. My colleague the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) says that it is closer to $100 million. This is almost the total amount of the untied funds that went to Victoria.

You blokes are ripping off our road network. You're using road funds for other purposes instead of those purposes for which they have been designed'. If there is any continuing deficiency in the road network in Victoria, I appeal to the honourable member to keep it under surveillance.

        What we really should do is examine what the national road network as a whole would be like now had it not been for the fact that the Whitlam government introduced a national highway system. The national highway is a magnificent network. Initially, it ran for 16,000 kilometres right around Australia, linking together the capital cities. The federal government then took over that responsibility because the states did not necessarily give it priority.

        In New South Wales, for example, it is more important in respect of all of those roads that feed through Sydney, not so much the roads that link Sydney to Brisbane, Sydney to Melbourne or Sydney to Adelaide. The federal government, including the predecessors of the honourable member for Bendigo and his colleagues, took over that responsibility. We said to the states, `Every single cent that is spent on those initial 16,000 kilometres and now 18,000 kilometres of important road links around Australia will be spent out of national taxpayers' dollars, whether it be for construction or for maintenance'. We took that responsibility for them. It is now their responsibility at this stage to acknowledge that the burden has been eased from their shoulders and to put more of their funds back into those roads which are their own responsibility.

        —In supporting my colleagues the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), I introduce some experience into this debate since the government members who have already spoken have missed the point—I practised in Australia as a civil engineer for 20-odd years—by drawing to the attention of this House the fact that we have not been allocating sufficient funding to road infrastructure. Australia probably has some of the worst and most severe road conditions of any nation in which to design, construct and maintain roads. Because of the large geographic diversity of our country, we are often required to use local quarries for pavement material for the most cost-effective construction, which means that the best materials are not always available. Our road infrastructure system has been deteriorating around our ears, despite the funds and the amount of money spent over the last decade. This was brought to our attention by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who asked about how much can a government spend at any one time. But the Australian Labor Party has been in government for 10 to 11 years. So there has been an enormous amount of time.

        Back in the mid- to late 1980s, leading up to the bicentenary, about $2 billion—a reasonable amount of money—was allocated specifically to the construction of road infrastructure, particularly of national highways. I commend the honourable members who have already spoken who probably played some part in allocating that amount of money. However, the real point is not so much the proportion of the federal excise that is allocated to road funding specifically but the total amount. Even $2 billion per annum is a token gesture towards what is necessary for this country to lead itself into the new century.

        It is disappointing for me to note that in the last budget, as the honourable member for Bendigo brought to our attention, funding was slashed from a total of $1.6 billion to $1 billion and then to $800 million, which is the amount foreshadowed for the next year. The point is that this halves the total amount in the two years. The Kelty report on regional development, as each region is analysed by the committee, has a common theme running through it: the need for strategic modernisation and development of our road infrastructure. The report also has a whole range of other themes. I put a serious challenge before the government: as this report currently stands, it is a series of motherhood statements, but a commitment must be made for a reasonable amount of funding to be allocated to the national road network.

        The honourable member for Bendigo made reference to the Sunraysia Highway. I draw his attention to two specific federal highways in my electorate. One of the appalling aspects of our road system is the statistics. I mention the Sturt Highway, which the honourable member for Bendigo mentioned. In the short length of 125 kilometres, from Mildura to the South Australian border, heading across to the rich, horticultural areas of the Riverland, in the last 10 years there have been 390 accidents—21 fatal accidents resulting in 28 deaths, 120 serious injuries requiring hospitalisation and 435 people hurt to the extent of requiring medical attention. That is a federal highway which is specifically known as a fatigue zone.

        I also mention the Western Highway, which has a huge vehicle density of 1,500 vehicles per day. It gets traffic from Horsham across to South Australia. There were 1,149 accidents in 10 years—44 fatal accidents resulting in 58 deaths, 413 serious injuries and 562 people hurt to the extent of requiring medical attention. If those accidents are translated into dollar terms of the cost to our public health system, the equation for cost benefit and spending money on our national road system could be justified. I challenge the government, as it considers expenditure as we come up to the next budget sitting, to rethink its attitude and to bring Australia into the new century by improving road infrastructure.

        In Tasmania a number of pressing problems need to be addressed in some way or another, particularly in relation to tourism and recreation. These areas have been neglected because of a lack of strategy, yet they should be given consideration. Under the present criteria, Tasmania's Marlborough Highway does not receive a priority to warrant a major upgrading, but specific usage now requires it to be made up, as it is a very important link between two other major road systems. The Lake Highway, which is a link between the north-west and the south, needs sealing and upgrading if the area is to realise its potential for tourism, fishing and boating.

There was a photograph in the local press this week showing how the state government has made itself a laughing stock with a road that has been put through and comes to a dead end. I am not suggesting that this service should even be sealed. A gravel road would be adequate, provided it were maintained. All that funding has been paid out to seal a road that, at the moment, services three residents, and that is mainly in high summer. It cannot be justified in any way. Another 22 kilometres of road would provide a round link for a tourist operation. It is these sorts of issues that local and state governments have to reassess. They have to look at making their road dollars go further to try to link with other modes of transport in the region.

        I was very impressed when I took a trip in 1988 to Bergen, Norway, a town not unlike many in Tasmania. There they use the transport system very efficiently. There was a tour called `Norway in a nutshell'. I took a train through some spectacular scenery for two hours. The train met a ferry system that toured the fiords and various settlements. After wandering the fiords for another couple of hours I was deposited at a bus stop to get back to Bergen. This system of transport was picking up freight all the time and used the tourist passengers to help the system to be more efficient and effective. The national transport planning task force will be an ideal vehicle to address the role of road transport in Australia and to improve the transport system.

       Female genital mutilation is the worst type of culturally acceptable assault. It has been practised on females by some ethnic communities for thousands of years to ensure their virginity as `maidens' and their faithfulness as wives. It is important that this procedure be not seen simply as female circumcision, especially since it has no medical or religious basis. It is a traumatic and violent attack on women and children that is painful, dangerous and has serious long-term physical and psychological repercussions. It can cause death.

        For those listening the details are horrific, but not to expose them would be to underestimate the argument for reform. Female genital mutilation can involve any one of four procedures, although Armstrong suggested in the

       The first and least severe form of female genital mutilation is called ritualised circumcision. In this case the procedure may be wholly ritualised, whereby there is a cleansing and/or an application of substance around the clitoris. In other forms of ritualised circumcision the clitoris is scraped or nicked. This causes bleeding but results in little mutilation or long-term damage.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The second form is simply called circumcision, or sunna. This involves the removal of the clitoral pupuce or hood. The glans and body of the clitoris are meant to remain intact. However, this second form often involves removal of the glans of the clitoris. A third form is called excision, or clitoridectomy. This is said to be the most common form of female genital mutilation. It involves removal of the glans of the clitoris but usually the entire clitoris and often parts of the labia minora as well.

        The most severe form is infibulation. This involves the removal of virtually all of the external female genitalia. The entire clitoris and labia minora and much of the labia majora are cut or hacked away. The remaining raw edges and the labia majora are then sewn together with acacia tree thorns and held in place with catgut or sewing thread. Sometimes a paste of gum arabic, sugar and egg is used to close the vulva. A small opening about the size of a matchstick is left for passing urine and menstrual fluid. A straw, stick or bamboo is inserted so that, as the wound heals, the flesh will not grow together and close the small opening.

        It is understood that in recent years in some areas where doctors perform the procedure, the labia is sewn together without cutting. Following marriage, the husband must penetrate the infibulated vulva. In some countries, this is done with a knife before marriage is consummated. In Somalia, the husband uses his fingers, a knife or razor while in other cultures the husband's mother or grandmother measures his penis, makes a wooden replica the same size and cuts the  infibulated opening of the bride accordingly.

        There is substantial evidence that this sickening practice is occurring in Australia. Although it constitutes an assault or child abuse under existing statute law, the legal situation remains unclear and therefore inadequate. Other Western countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom, have passed specific legislation to outlaw these practices. Australia must do the same. Multiculturalism has given much to Australia and ensured a rich diversity in my own electorate of Adelaide, but there are some practices that are so abhorrent to the wider Australian community that we must be prepared to say that we will not tolerate them. We do not permit women to be stoned to death for adultery, as is the practice in some other parts of the world. We would not allow children's and women's faces to be mutilated. Therefore, it is imperative that we do not allow the genital mutilation of women or little girls just because that area of their bodies is hidden from sight.

        The Family Law Council recommended in its just released discussion paper that legislation should make it clear that all forms of female genital mutilation, including ritualised circumcision, are not acceptable in Australia. It says there are serious doubts about the capacity of current state laws to cope with these types of international offences and reaches the preliminary conclusion that legislation should be passed to put these issues beyond doubt. The simplest, most effective and quickest way to achieve these legislative aims is for one act to be passed which builds on existing state legislation and services. I call on the government to introduce such legislation and, in doing so, highlight the need for education.

        The practice of mutilation in Australia is shrouded in secrecy and evidence is mainly anecdotal. Documentation is limited, but I have spoken with social workers who, while maintaining the necessary confidentiality, have left me in no doubt that they are aware it is happening. The Somali community in South Australia has alleged the practice occurs in Melbourne using `old grannies'. The South Australian Children's Interest Bureau has also documented a case of a child admitted to a private hospital on Christmas Eve 1992 to have female genital mutilation performed by a doctor. Cases have been identified within the Malaysian community in Western Australia, while there is anecdotal evidence that there are Egyptian women in Melbourne who perform the operation.

        Female genital mutilation has occurred for at least 5,000 years, predating Islam, Christianity and other major religions. Both Muslim and non-Muslim religious leaders have emphasised the absence of a religious foundation for the custom. It is widely accepted as a way of controlling women.

It is almost with shame that I realise the lack of parliamentary action on this issue while there have been individuals and small groups fighting for some time to have the horrors of these practices publicised and outlawed. In Somalia, where up to 90 per cent of women are infibulated, the Somali Women's Democratic Organisation has succeeded in getting a public campaign under way. We must support them. The secrecy which surrounds the issue can be lifted only if women themselves speak out about the practice. Those who sit in this chamber have an obligation to respond and to see that this reform takes place. In this country we are fortunate that women have a right to sit in parliament and to speak out without fear. We must help women from other communities who do not enjoy the same freedom.

        In closing, I highlight the fact that, while I condemn the practice, I do not condemn those people trapped in this tradition. It is important to understand that many migrants to Australia from countries where the procedure is widespread do not necessarily support it. If, by legislation, we save only one little girl from undergoing this barbaric procedure, our efforts will have been worth while.

I think it is an extremely important one and I know that she, as a former nurse, feels strongly about this as do I think all the women in the House. I would also like to congratulate the Family Law Council for bringing out this discussion paper, which was issued less than a month ago, on which I understand the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) will be basing his considerations regarding any future legislation.

I will not call the act on women circumcision because I do not think it is at all. I do not think the procedures can be compared, but if comparing them one would have to say that for men it would involve removing the penis and stitching the testicles together.

        As the honourable member for Adelaide has said, it involves not only a very painful procedure but also a painful lifestyle. Urination is long and painful, sex is painful and certainly not enjoyable and menstrual blood builds up because there is not sufficient outlet. There is an instance quoted in the discussion paper of girls in Africa being killed because the build-up of menstrual blood has bloated their bellies and they are thought to have been pregnant.

It is about power and, sadly, it does give women in these communities virtually the only power they have; that is, power over their daughters. I have been told that some women in the UK who have realised that this is an inappropriate thing to do to their daughters have now questioned their own womanhood and are now blaming their own parents. There is a lot of psychological disturbance among those people as it also leaves them virtually powerless in those sorts of families.

        As has been said, this act is child abuse and the law in this country does not allow child abuse. It does not allow common assault, which this act also represents. There is legislation in all the states which makes this illegal. Australia has supported all the UN declarations concerning violence, and particularly violence against women. It is a signatory to the World Health Organisation resolution that this matter should be constantly monitored and acted upon. However, I agree with the honourable member for Adelaide that a ban needs to be put on this particular practice. The fact that it is illegal under other legislation does not make it strong enough.

        I also agree that education runs hand in hand with legislation. There is a group of African women in Melbourne at the moment who, I understand, are working with women in their own communities. This is appropriate because, when we get into this area of cultural practices, I think it is inappropriate that Western women are seen to be dictating to women from other cultures, so it is much better that the education comes from their own people.

So the fact that we are banning it will not make it more so. I certainly endorse those things that the honourable member for Adelaide has said and support the motion.

        —In seconding the motion, I acknowledge the sensitivities of this subject. Cultural differences are often difficult for others to understand and, in this case, accept. Changes to Australia's immigration policies over the past two to three decades have resulted in a much more ethnically diverse migrant intake than previously. Certainly, the issue of female circumcision—now usually referred to as female genital mutilation—has attracted public attention here only in recent years. While female genital mutilation is part of some cultures' tradition, no-one is prepared to defend it publicly in Australia; nor are there any medical or religious grounds for it. However, the fact remains that an increasing number of Australian women and girls have to endure horrific lifelong emotional and physical scars as a result of this barbaric mutilation of their genitalia.

        The serious health risks of the procedure itself are substantial. Further, the girls' mothers are often afraid to seek medical help for their daughters for fear that these amateur circumcisions are reported—resulting in further humiliation—when, in fact, they have been forced to agree to the traditional practices of their homeland.

        As a result of some requests to Australian doctors to circumcise young girls, the Australian Medical Association has recommended to the federal government that female genital mutilation be outlawed in this country. Dr Brendan Nelson, President of the AMA, has said:

       Dr Nelson's call to outlaw female genital mutilation followed a Melbourne magistrate's statement that the practice was `clearly' happening in Melbourne and—because government policy is still being formulated—children are going to continue to suffer a `surgical intrusion' of their bodies which is clearly `a type of assault'. The magistrate's comments accompanied the granting of an interim protection order over two girls, aged 18 months and three years, who had been circumcised.

        For far too long in this country this subject has escaped public attention and comment. As a result, the practice has continued unhindered. If we do not take it out of the `too hard' basket without further delay, its continuation should be on our consciences—and heads. While the Department of Health investigates the issue and formulates policy, young girls continue to be sexually mutilated in this country. Whilst I recognise that legislation on this subject would normally be accepted as the responsibility of our state parliaments, it must be acknowledged that as a nation we are party to a number of United Nations declarations and conventions which contain sections relevant to it. This puts an obligation on Australia to live up to the statements it has endorsed in international forums.

        The doubt and hesitancy which has characterised our authorities' efforts to combat female genital mutilation means that the Commonwealth government must take the lead. This does not necessarily mean that it should force its preferred legislation onto unwilling states. It does mean, however, that it must stop dithering and must act. For example, it could draft some model legislation for consideration by state health ministers. It could include genital mutilation of female Australian children in campaigns against child abuse and domestic violence. Above all, it must immediately abjure the conspiracy of silence which has allowed the bodies and psyches of our little girls to be so horrendously abused.

        When migrants come to Australia, they bring with them many good and useful attitudes and practices. The devotion to family is an excellent attribute for the vast majority of migrants. Australia also gives to the migrants a lot of wonderful advantages. Equality between men and women and the rule of law are two of the more valuable Australian advantages. Unfortunately, some unpleasant folk customs are also brought to Australia. Female genital mutilation is undoubtedly one of the worst.

Female genital mutilation is a totally barbaric and outdated ritual that has about as much relevance to the late 20th century as witchcraft. Apart from permanently resulting in diminished sexual pleasure for women, it causes humiliation, psychological problems, pain, infection and often death. I stress that it equates in no way with male circumcision.

        About 100 million women in the world today have been mutilated in such a way. They are concentrated in about 40 countries, especially in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia but, because of migration patterns, this practice is spreading to other countries of the world. Probably several thousand women in Australia have experienced this degrading practice, mainly before they came to this country. No accurate figures are available, but there must be upwards of several dozen who even now have it practised on them in Australia in one form or another.

        The average Australian would have no idea what female genital mutilation involves. They probably think that it is some harmless nick in that region or something like that. It is usually performed without anaesthetic. The child is held down. Instruments which are used are often dirty and blunt and include kitchen knives, razor blades, glass and sharp stones. The wounds are dabbed with ash, lemon juice, herbs or cow dung and bandaging that is performed can trap excreta in the area. Death often occurs, not only from infection but from accidental cutting of the pudendal artery, the clitoral artery or the dorsal artery. One book on this subject states that 100 million women have gone `missing' as a result of this practice.

        Eighty per cent of female genital mutilation is done in the home. I was interested to find in one study that 16.2 per cent of it is performed by barbers. Girls are usually done when aged between one week and 14 years, with a concentration in the three- to eight-year-old age bracket. The operation varies from relatively harmless scraping or nicking in the clitoral area through to the removal of the clitoral hood and surrounding tissues, to the total removal of the clitoris and labia minora, to infibulation, which is done on 80 to 90 per cent of women in some countries. During the process of infibulation, the entire clitoral area, the entire labia minora and much of the labia majora are cut, hacked or scraped away. As a National Party member, a farmer and a veterinarian, to me it conjures up images of something like the radical mulesing operation that is performed on sheep, whereby the skin at the back of a sheep is hacked away to cut down on flystrike.

        During the process of infibulation, the raw edges of the vulva are often sewn together with acacia tree thorns and sewing thread after being brought together by a paste of gum arabic, sugar or egg. Only a very small hole is left, which can make urination very difficult; on average, it takes about 15 minutes, drop by drop. As the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) said, a bank-up of menstrual fluids can develop as a result. To keep this hole open after the operation, often a piece of bamboo, or straw, or a stick has to be placed in the area. Sometimes, when the hole is not sewn up, the legs are bound together, which often has to be done for weeks. On the wedding night, in order for consummation to take place, it has to be torn or cut open. It is often sewn up again after the female becomes pregnant and then opened at childbirth. Scarring causes a high rate of infant mortality, slower births and a lack of oxygen, causing brain damage for those children who live. The hole may be closed again after the adult female gets pregnant again, or when she becomes divorced, or upon the death of her husband. It is a totally barbaric practice.

        As the only male speaker of the six to speak to this motion, I think it is somewhat ironic that, even though the practice grew out of a patriarchal society, nowadays it is performed by females—both assistants, who hold the child down, and midwives, who largely perform the operation. I am delighted that this barbaric practice is changing, and I believe that every female group in the world should speak out against it. The laws in this country are far too vague about it. This has been recognised in Canada and England. They have brought down specific laws over and above the child abuse laws which we have in this country. This is something that we should do here too. Education is important, but we must have specific laws. I urge everybody to support the motion.

Obviously, in our multicultural society, our national agenda has said that we have to manage the consequences of cultural diversity in the interests of the individual and society as a whole. However, it also includes the right of all Australians to equality of treatment and opportunity and the removal of the barriers of race, ethnicity, culture, religion, language, gender or place of birth. So in managing this very difficult issue we need a legislative framework to make it very clear that this practice is not acceptable, but also we have to set in place through community networks an ability to assist new migrants to our country understand that it is not acceptable.

        —I am delighted to have the opportunity, however briefly, to speak to this motion. In the brief time that I have been in the parliament, this is the first time that I have heard complete and utter agreement from both sides of the House. It is a wonderful reflection on all the speakers who have spoken on this particularly vexing issue that they have agreed and have been fulsome in their praise of each other. The honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) made an aside a short time ago, `Look what happens when you let women run things'. Perhaps that is a lesson for all of us because she certainly has done a marvellous job today on this particular issue.

        It is also refreshing that this matter has been spoken about so openly. When the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) was speaking to me earlier today she said, `On a subject as important as this one, you really have to be fairly blunt about what you are talking about because it is no good speaking in euphemisms if people do not understand'. Everyone has made the case very categorically and very clearly about how barbaric the practice of female genital mutilation is.

         —The sports rorts affair is with us again. There is yet another example of the scandalous behaviour of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in administering the community grants program. I wonder whether the Ford Motor Co. will be introducing a special new option for the motor vehicles that it supplies to the Commonwealth car fleet. It appears from the story that has appeared in the newspapers over the weekend that it ought to perhaps provide a special fold-down whiteboard option in the Ford LTDs that it supplies to drive around ministers.

         The minister for sports rorts could certainly have used a fold-down whiteboard in the Commonwealth car that she used en route to the Greensborough bowling club in the marginal seat of Jagajaga prior to the federal election. Apparently, a grant of $60,000 was announced to that bowling club as part of the sports rorts program. During the minister's trip, that grant rose from $60,000 to $100,000. I have calculated that the cost to the taxpayer of that little car trip was about $1,000 per kilometre. That is not a small amount in anybody's estimation. The situation has come to a head—

It represents an enormous loss of talent and productivity to the community and conservatively costs the nation over $50 million. I ask the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson): when will the report of the CFS working party, established by him last year, be completed; why has he restricted its terms of reference to the Medicare ramifications of CFS only; what about his government's support for basic CFS research; and will we see this recognised in May's 1994-95 budget or will we see further frustration from CFS sufferers, who are neither supported nor believed?

         The first test of this government's exercise of opportunities for backbenchers to speak in this place will come this afternoon. The first test will be whether its ministers can answer 14 questions in 45 minutes and whether the government will give people an opportunity to speak in the grievance debate. The second test will be whether at 5.15 p.m. the government starts government business, which I assume will be the case. It is a requirement of the government to make sure that its ministers shorten their answers so that 14 questions are asked within 45 minutes, and that people are given an opportunity in the grievance debate to make the comments on behalf of their electorates that they are duly entitled to make.

I will tell the House about Michael Harris, a former union organiser and lifelong Labor Party supporter. For 22 years he has been a member of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union. Last year, we saw this union exercise its idea of Labor's industrial relations policy when it sacked Mr Harris without question. Why? Because he would not drop campaign material in letterboxes for Mr Ron Edwards, the defeated Labor member for Stirling. Mr Harris said:

         The Labor Party and the unions have, by practising the hypocrisy and double standards that we are used to from them, shown that their policy is, `Do as we say, not as we do'. Had Mr Harris worked for private enterprise and been sacked because he refused to hand out Liberal Party paraphernalia, the unions would have chucked a mega-wobbly. Now that the shoe is on the other foot and their duplicity has been exposed the unions have shown that they are not for the worker; they are only there to provide a springboard to launch their hierarchy into the parliamentary Labor Party, irrespective of the lies they must make. The unions have again underlined that, with Labor, the workers are damned.

Although I congratulate the government for recognising Macedonia at long last, it is a great pity we were among the last to do so. We should have been among the first. I am concerned at some of the restrictions that have been placed on this recognition. I would question whether they are acceptable under international law. One is that the Macedonians change their flag; another is that they display no symbols. There are various other things.

I would ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) why in this case it was felt necessary to put these restrictions on the recognition of the sovereign independent state of Macedonia. Regardless of what the restrictions may be I shall continue, as I always have done, to call Macedonia by its rightful name—the Republic of Macedonia. The flag of Macedonia will remain displayed in my office alongside the Australian flag, as indeed will the symbols of the sovereign independent state of Macedonia.

In demanding that Adams publicly renounce the use of violence, the minister displays a very poor understanding of the historical circumstances which have produced the republican movement. Such statements also misrepresent the nature and source of violence in Northern Ireland. The minister of course did not bother to ask Prince Charles whether he would renounce the use of terror by the armed forces in Northern Ireland.

         From the pogroms in 1922 to the calculated killings on Bloody Sunday, nationalists in the north of Ireland have borne more than their share of the terror that has afflicted Northern Ireland. Ironically, it was Gerry Adams who instigated the so-called peace talks and, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs should know, without Sinn Fein there will be no peace in Ireland. The President of the United States is prepared to meet Adams; yet our government, despite the avowed commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to an independent Australia, curtsies before mother England.

As a rural member, I find it somewhat upsetting that the government changed its road funding formula on commitments made at the 1990 Special Premiers Conference.

If it were not for those programs, part of that road would still be a depression built road of the 1930s, particularly the section between Lithgow and Bathurst, which was part of a Depression road building project during the 1930s. As a result, it is now possible for people to drive right through from Sydney to Bathurst on a very good standard of road, and that is improving as each day passes.

         —I am pleased that the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) is in the chamber. While we are talking about expenditure based on political considerations in a program such as the sports rorts program, he will recall, as a former minister, the local capital works program. In my electorate, the city of Wanneroo, which is one of the fastest growing municipalities in this country, got absolutely zilch from that program, yet it had 8,500 people unemployed. The honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), who is here today, had about 5,000 unemployed in the city of Canning, yet that particular municipality got $3 1/2 million. If ever there was a program that was designed and calculated to help out members in marginal Labor seats, it would have had to have been the local capital works program that was announced in the 1992 federal budget. While we are examining the ramifications of the sports rorts affair—

         —This is a question from the high taxation specialist. Those opposite have to have some front to be asking questions like this after having tried to impose a goods and services tax on people, and at the same time having tried to suggest that they would provide unfunded income tax cuts in a budget. Had a coalition government been returned to office, people would have ended up wearing the income tax system and a 15 per cent goods and services tax on every single item they consumed—on goods and on services.

         It is no accident that it took a Labor government to make this the lowest taxed country in the western world. Let me repeat this because I want to make sure it sinks in: it took a Labor government to turn Australia into the lowest taxed country in the western world. That is what it is. Our revenue share in GDP, when compared with the other 27 countries of the OECD, puts us at the bottom of the league table. That is because these days the funding of the public sector, the Commonwealth, is smaller than it was in 1983-84 and, therefore, requires less revenue. That is why we have been able to introduce those tax changes. When I became Treasurer in 1983 the top marginal rate of tax was 60 per cent; it is now 47 per cent. The corporate rate was 46 per cent; it is now 33 per cent. Dividends were taxed twice, now they are taxed once. As well as that, there is massive depreciation in the tax schedules for companies.

I was reflecting on how personal and corporate rates of tax had come down. The green paper which has been prepared on the question of unemployment canvasses the options of a jobs levy, that is, a levy to raise income to pay for programs to guarantee work experience and training to the long-term unemployed. That report goes to the core question of how we get this disadvantaged group back into the mainstream labour market.

         —In response to the question I can say that the government regards micro-economic reform as being most important indeed. Of course, it was this government which initiated the program of micro-economic reform. We had to transform this economy from the rather lacklustre, uncompetitive, inefficient economy which we inherited back in the early 1980s into an economy which could be internationally competitive and internally much more efficient and competitive. It is the program of micro-economic reform that we have instituted which has brought that about and enabled us to greatly improve our international trading performance, to be much more competitive in the rest of the world and to provide the platform for substantial economic growth in the future.

       <para first-indent="16">

         We are not intending to rest on our laurels. Indeed, we see the need for further enhancement of micro-economic reform if we are to get to those higher levels of economic and employment growth which we know to be necessary if we are to meet the ambitions of the Australian people to improve their living standards and, in particular, to get the economy growing at a rate which will give us employment of a substantial order and enable us to knock the unemployment rate down to much lower levels. It is an essential part of our program.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In that respect, as we look at where to go from here, given all the micro-economic reform to this stage, there is one clear area where we need to focus considerably—that is, those areas which are under the control of the states. In that respect, the Hilmer report on national competition policy clearly focused on the need for the Trade Practices Act to be extended to cover the areas from which it is currently excluded, which in the main relate to state government enterprises—to open those enterprises to competition and to force them therefore to become more efficient.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That is a very important agenda indeed. It relates to key areas of the economy like electricity, gas and various other areas of infrastructure which are important for us to produce efficiently if we are to give our basic producers the best possible chance to be internationally competitive.

         We will be taking this matter up with the states at the Council of Australian Governments meeting in Hobart next Friday. At that meeting we will be not only asking the states to support us on the implementation of the Hilmer report—of course, their support is absolutely essential for that to happen because they have to pass complementary legislation—but also looking at taking steps with them to reform the legal profession, workers compensation arrangements, water resource policy, free and fair trade in gas, electricity reform and Commonwealth-state roles and responsibilities. That is a very substantial agenda which we are asking the states to take on and we certainly expect that we will have their support to do so.

         However, there has been some concern from the states that this may have some untoward effect on them in the sense that it may affect their revenues. In a short-term sense, maybe that is true but maybe it is not. If it is true, as far as the federal government is concerned, we have not shrunk from micro-economic reform because of some temporary impact on our budgets. Our budgets have suffered considerably due to the direct effects of micro-economic reform in terms of reducing revenue and increasing outlays. The tariff reforms, for instance, are costing us something in the order of $600 million a year in lost revenue. We do not regret that in the sense that we did that consciously knowing that that would be the outcome and believing it to be the most appropriate thing to make the Australian economy more efficient, but it has a direct budgetary effect in that way.

         There was also substantial outlays for the waterfront reform and the shipping industry. The waterfront reform is a very important reform. The fact that there is a dispute now just demonstrates the degree of that reform because it would not have happened under the Liberal regime in the old days. There would never have been a dispute about the sacking of people by an enterprise because there was no enterprise employment at all on the waterfront when the Liberals were in charge of it. All that happened was that, instead of people being laid off and the industry trying to make itself more efficient, it simply passed on the costs in a cost-plus way to the consumers. The industry simply had no intention of becoming a much more efficient industry until we forced it to do so. As part of that approach, we spent about $170 million to achieve it. It was money well spent to make dramatic changes in that industry.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There have been various other ways in which we have suffered an impact on our budget, but I will not take up the time of the House in going through them. I simply say to the states that, if there is such an impact, it will be a temporary one because the main game is to get the economy growing faster. If micro-economic reforms by the states in conjunction with us lead to faster economic growth, which they will, the states will benefit from that through a higher level of income for the whole community and therefore increased tax revenue for them. I say to the states: support us to the hilt on this. This is a very important next step in the micro-economic reform agenda. It is a crucial next step for the Australian economy. If we can bring this home with the states, Australia can set fair for higher levels of economic growth for the rest of this century and beyond.

         I want to stress that in the last four years we have seen a great deal of progress on the waterfront. That is worth remembering and recording because we have seen container terminal labour productivity double during that period. We have seen average ship turnaround times halved.

The only thing those in the opposition had in common was their cry to kick the union can.

         —We are used to Ian's empty-headed comments; he has given them to us for 20 years. In 1994 the National Health and Medical Research Council allocated $1.4 million to breast cancer research projects. But there is a $14 million commitment of funding to cancer research, much of which is of a generic variety that affects all cancers and that, of course, naturally, affects breast cancer as well. So one cannot delineate to the dollar what is going to breast cancer and what is going to other areas. The National Health and Medical Research Council has given extra weighting to breast cancer research applications. Forty-six per cent of the applications in this area were supported for 1994 compared with an overall success rate of 27 per cent for other applications.

         The government has recognised that more funding is needed for medical research and it has committed itself to a target of lifting health research funding to two per cent of total health expenditure by the year 2000. This will mean that a greater level of funding will be generally available to medical research, including for various cancers.

         Due to the proven benefits of an effective screening program in reducing the incidence of breast cancer amongst women in the most heavily affected age group—which is 50 to 69 years of age—the Commonwealth is heavily involved with the national breast cancer screening program, which has been undertaken in collaboration with the states and territories, and $30 million is committed to the program for this financial year. By June this year, it is anticipated that the program will have the capacity to screen 630,000 women each year.

But, given the figures we have seen of an increase in the incidence of success for applications in respect of breast cancer, one can expect to see a higher level of funding going to, peculiarly, breast cancer related research projects.

         Clearly, the reason for the extremely buoyant condition of the housing industry is that the levels of affordability are the best they have been for a decade. Indeed, one could argue that the success of the government in creating a new economic paradigm in this country has been directly translated into the housing industry. Where interest rates are low and inflation is very low, a climate is created in which there are unparalleled degrees of confidence.

         In part, one can refer to these conditions as reflecting more choice and more appropriate housing in the housing industry, a recognition that demographic change itself creates a certain level of demand, and that there is a need for different kinds of housing and that that, in turn, is fuelling demand. But there is a concern in the longer term that with these current levels of commencements being very high there must be some falling off.

         It is important to recognise that, while conditions are very good, those conditions clearly will not last forever. That is a very good reason why the housing industry needs to look to operating in more of an international environment, to look to the opportunities not only to build housing in this country, which it does extremely efficiently, but also to manufacture housing related products internationally. Today's news from the Indicative Planning Council is indeed good news. There have been very high levels of commencement this year. Many thousands of younger Australians are getting into housing in conditions of affordability that are as good as they have been for a decade.

I ask him again: if the commissioner finds that there is any environmental risk in that 68,000-pig proposal which the Prime Minister currently has, will he do the right thing and move it?

         —We would all be aware that over a number of years there have been significant problems in the construction industry concerning tendering, management and work practices. The industry has been characterised by industrial unrest for a number of years. Both sides, industry and management, became used to coping in that environment—a very poor environment in which to construct major projects in this country. The point was not to cope with the environment but to change it. In 1991 the government established the Construction Industry Development Agency and by a couple of means has ensured that we now have far more efficient major construction in this country.

         Using the power of the Commonwealth and state governments, which are major constructors in this country, we seek what we call prequalification criteria from contractors, subcontractors and consultants. In effect, this is a due diligence process to ascertain such things as whether these people who contract to do work are able to complete the work, whether they are financially viable and whether they can complete the job on time, as they claim they can.

In the last sitting of the parliament, I spoke of the Commonwealth's commitment to funding substantially increased places in higher education institutions, so much so that, in the decade 1988 to 1998, there will be an additional 100,000 places. But our commitment to open learning is our further support for spreading the ability to expand opportunity in higher education as well as bringing much more flexibility to enable those people who cannot physically visit a campus—for whatever reason—to nevertheless gain learning and higher education, including the qualifications that go with that.

Unlike some of the overseas experiences, this is not an open university. It is essentially support for in the main a brokerage, whereby the universities—and now 18 have signed up for this—offer their courses and, in the process of offering those courses, have at the same time to give the accreditation if the person qualifies.

         —I have no recollection of that issue, none whatsoever. But I can say that, in the lead-up to the 1993 election, there was an occasion when the Leader of the Opposition promised in Cairns to give away more than $30 million, which is more than the entire sporting program budget. On 16 February last year the Leader of the Opposition went on the John MacKenzie radio program in Cairns and promised $30 million towards setting up a university at Cairns. He said:

He should be whipped along by the media for being the humbug and hypocrite that he is and for proposing to dish out $30 million while berating the minister for a program where every proposal she ticked was eligible to be ticked by her and where the matter in dispute was choices by her—not eligibility, but choices by her.

         This funding was proposed by the Leader of the Opposition when there was no program and no eligibility. It was like the question asked in the election campaign about the tricked-up funding for Telecom. When the journalist asked him, `Who costed it, Dr Hewson?', he said, `I did it'. When asked, `How did you do it? How did you get the $30 million?', he said, `Three times 10—because I am on the winner's box and I'm sliding home to ballot box day.' Well, Mr Speaker, it was not that easy, and he is still in opposition. But what this reveals is what a complete hypocrite and humbug he is—as is the shadow minister, who has done his best under difficult circumstances but who, I am afraid, is not good enough.

         But there is more than micro-economic reform at the heart of this new training system. In fact, it is about empowering ordinary Australians. The new training system, which will be implemented in cooperation with the states from 1995, is designed to ensure that Australians have access to post-school training which provides them with qualifications which are nationally recognised. It will also provide them with the generic skills they need to retrain as their own personal needs and interests, as well as those of the economy, change in coming years.

         In early January I provided in principle approval for six pilot projects under the new Australian vocational certificate system of training, which is specifically targeted to meet the training needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. These pilots are scheduled to commence as soon as is practicable this year. They cover a diversity of activities including a program of the Catholic Education Office of Western Australia, which is training young Aboriginal people for administrative support positions in remote rural communities. Another notable example is the scheme training young people for work in community stores in isolated Northern Territory settlements. Late last year I had the pleasure of meeting the Aboriginal trainee of the year, an outstanding young man by the name of Jamie Liddle.

         —We have all had a briefing on the new standing orders, and we thank the clerks for that and thank you, Mr Speaker, for the arrangements you made for it. However, there is some doubt about the application of the seven-day rule. Sure, it applies in the standing orders for legislation which may be, by special arrangement, referred to the new main committee, and that is clear-cut. But what is not clear cut is what happens when a bill rolls on into the House proper. Does the seven-day rule apply or will the opposition be confronted with a second reading speech under the process and a shadow immediately having to reply?

         In the context of these new standing orders I wish to raise two matters. Firstly, to the extent possible—and I know you are limited by the letter of the standing orders—can you advise whether the seven-day convention should apply in all circumstances relating to legislation unless there is a suspension, which is a matter then for the House to address?

         Secondly, I understand this new main committee is going to be set up in one of the committee rooms. I ask you to give consideration to something that has already been debated—though I do not dwell on it. There was a hefty body of opinion on the floor of the House a few years back that the old Speaker's chair should have been utilised. I submit that this would be a good opportunity to bring the old Speaker's chair up to the second chamber.

My understanding of the process is that there is an opportunity to ensure that the second reading and the debate on the second reading can proceed with the leave of the House without the need for the seven-day rule to be observed. That may be something which the government is still looking at as we finetune the detail of the proposals in the House. Indeed, we are all learning—and if in fact that is not the case, I am sure I will be told as well. I will ask the Leader of the House to respond in a minute because I think there is some general interest in this.

          The room to be used for the second chamber, or the main committee, is still being looked at. As to whether the Speaker's chair from the old Parliament House might form part of that chamber, I would suggest that it probably would not in that the architecture of this place does not readily lend itself to that. The size of the room in question might be a problem, and there is some historic interest in where the chair should be situated.

         —My understanding of standing orders, which I have subsequently confirmed with the clerks—and the opposition might discuss this with the clerks, too—is that the material is not going to the main committee. The situation is not dissimilar from that which applies now. Technically speaking we could debate the bill the next day, not immediately. Standing orders would have to be suspended to debate the bill immediately. There are a few things that we will have to nut out in that regard, particularly the presentation of appropriation bills connected with budget statements. We will need to work our way through that. Obviously it is not the government's intention that that is how the chamber should proceed, so we shall look more closely at the standing orders to work out ways we might get around it.

         We are principally concerned, in the way in which the standing orders were drafted, to obviate a concern which had been expressed around the chamber that matters could be, without consideration by the opposition or consultation, forced into the main committee, with debate being taken out of this place. There were other features of the operation of the main committee which, if we go through them, would make that virtually impossible because, effectively on any disruption from either side of the House, we can take stuff out of the main committee and put it back in here. But it was determined that there definitely should be that gap to allow detailed consideration by the opposition.

         It would not be the intention of the government to take advantage of the fact that we could introduce legislation one day and debate it the next. There is no particular reason why we should, any more than in the old way we would have introduced legislation, done the second reading straight away and then brought it on the next day. Generally speaking, there has always been an allowance of at least into the next week, if not strictly the seven days. There will be no intention by the government to walk back from that. My attention has been drawn to the particular problem associated with it and also to the problems associated with the way in which the budget, and particularly the budget reply, is done. If there is a need to act on it we will.

        —by leave—Mr Speaker, on 2 February I raised in this place a matter of possible breach of privilege arising from the unauthorised disclosure and publication of documents received by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. The documents related to the committee's review of the Auditor-General's report

        In accordance with the rules and procedures adopted by the House, I raised this matter in the committee to ascertain whether the disclosure of those documents amounted to a substantial interference with its work and, accordingly, whether I should bring the matter back to the House and seek precedence for a motion to refer the unauthorised disclosures to the Standing Committee of Privileges. The view of the committee was that there was nothing to be gained by referring this matter to the Standing Committee of Privileges. However, I and the committee believe that the disclosure has certainly damaged the committee and has made it much less likely that our work can be completed in a cooperative atmosphere.

        At the beginning of the committee's public hearing on 16 December last, the chairman, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), referred to the committee's long history of bipartisanship and its reputation for taking reasonable and fair approaches to the issues before it. I strongly agreed with the chairman's intention that we should take a cooperative and essentially non-partisan approach of the audit report wherever possible. Perhaps under the circumstances this was a vain hope, but I and I believe a majority of the committee were deeply disappointed when these documents were leaked.

        The disclosure was ill-considered for two reasons: firstly, it was a very divisive action as far as the committee was concerned and, secondly, it was unnecessary because the proposal before the committee was that it would authorise the publication of those documents anyway. Indeed, the committee did so at its meeting on the following Thursday morning. It would have enhanced the committee's credibility and helped to foster a more professional approach had the documents been disclosed first by the committee itself.

        It cannot be said that the unauthorised disclosure of these documents has substantially interfered with the work of the committee, particularly when one takes into account the fact that we later authorised the publication of the documents in question. However, the disclosure of details of the proceedings of a private meeting of the committee held with the Auditor-General on the evening of Thursday, 3 February has been much more damaging. It has exacerbated the partisan and divisive atmosphere that has entered our deliberations and it has diminished the prospects for building mutual trust and respect between committee members.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        More seriously, these latter disclosures have cast considerable doubt on the committee's ability to conduct private briefings and to guarantee confidentiality of those with whom we meet. As far as possible, our inquiries ought to be conducted in the public arena, but there are times when we need to be able to hold private and frank discussions. Future witnesses are unlikely to feel quite so relaxed when privately briefing the committee on sensitive issues.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        I am also concerned that our inability to prevent these disclosures or to take action against the people who have so damaged the committee may spill over and affect the work of other committees. The person who made these disclosures and the journalists who published the material so obtained have done the committee and this House a grave disservice and may have seriously damaged the committee system as a whole. The work of the committee has been interfered with and its future deliberations compromised but, as I said earlier, our view was that there was nothing to be achieved by seeking to review the unauthorised disclosure of the documents to the committee of privileges and I do not intend so to move.

The facts are that, as a result of receiving advice on 15 November 1992 from the applicant for that particular grant that an application had been made, I wrote on 17 November 1992—two days later—to the assistant director of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories giving the strongest possible support for the merits of the Ravensthorpe application. A copy was sent to the applicant. It  should  be  noted,  nevertheless,  that  in doing my duty as an MP I wrote to the department, not the minister, as I was still mistakenly of the belief that the merits of such applications would be decided by experienced officials, not some ministerial whiteboard lottery.

       We the undersigned citizens of Australia draw to the attention of the House, that there is widespread concern amongst patients realising the cost involved, in being treated for problems relating to infertility, whereby certain expensive drugs and procedures are required to necessitate conception. The Government has imposed a subsidised 6 cycle limit on G.I.F.T., I.V.F. and associated procedures. Taking into consideration that as few as 12% of all cycles, induced or otherwise, are going to result in a conception and that as many as 50% of all conceptions end in abortion, this leaves the patient with only 6 subsidised attempts in her lifetime to produce a family. A stressful gamble often resulting in many patients being forced to forego the prospect of a family as raising the necessary money is indeed prohibitive.

         `The law' supposedly exists to protect the innocent from those without ethics or scruples. Yet this same `law' is now used as a weapon against these `small people'. Only in the Bible does David beat Goliath. This was proved with a vengeance when we were forced, unassisted, to take Australia's largest insurance company to court in a civil action, and were destroyed in the process.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        This document is one of several that my constituent has prepared in an endeavour to highlight the deficiencies in our legal system in so far as equality of access is concerned. The cost of justice has been the subject of a long running inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The committee has published several discussion papers on the cost of legal services and litigation. To date it has presented two reports with at least one more in the pipeline.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The reports make very interesting albeit somewhat disturbing reading. They serve to highlight the fact that for many Australians, particularly those in the middle income group, our legal system is far from user friendly. Whilst the rich can usually manage to afford their day in court and the poor can usually get legal aid, the majority in the middle are being denied the effective and equitable access to legal advice and justice they deserve and to which they are, or should be, entitled.

         The matter which has caused and is continuing to cause my constituent and his family such distress is extremely complex. More than 5,000 pages of court transcripts and other documents are involved. It relates to an incident in mid-1990 when a person or persons forcibly entered and set fire to the factory where my constituent conducted his manufacturing business.

         Obviously it is impossible to examine all of the pros and cons of this case in the 10 minutes available to me in this debate. I do however have the permission of my constituent to make full details available to any members who may be interested in learning more about how our so-called system of justice is in fact riddled with injustices.

         To briefly summarise the situation, following a fire at my constituent's factory, a claim was lodged with his insurance company. It soon became obvious that his insurers had no intention of settling the claim although it took them some eight months to actually deny the liability in writing. During this time my constituent struggled to keep his business operating. To quote him:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is not overstating the case to accuse the insurance company of psychological warfare. Deny everything, cause delay and expense wherever possible; then accuse the victim of every conceivable crime, irrespective of the evidence. This is guaranteed to exhaust them financially, emotionally and spiritually—long before the matter is heard in court.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, about two years elapsed before the matter got to court. By this time my constituent had been forced out of business. He may have lost most of his assets, but not his perseverance and his determination. Fortunately, there was a solicitor who was sympathetic to his predicament. Again I quote from one of the documents my constituent has supplied:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Our family solicitor, who operates a one man practice, took the case to court with the help of a young and inexperienced barrister, receiving only a nominal advance towards costs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Even though the facts were in our favour, at the actual hearing we were outclassed and annihilated by the insurance company's team of trained experts. An under-12 football team against the current AFL premiers would be evenly matched by comparison. A crow picking the eyes out of a new born lamb would have been closer to the mark!
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        By the time the matter got to court, I was suffering from stress related problems, was unable to concentrate, had memory lapses, knew what I wanted to say but couldn't find the right words, and was easily confused.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The hearing lasted for over 4 weeks.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        During the hearing, there were discussions between the insurance company and the judge over precedents. The insurance company admitted that they intended to try to establish new ones. Perhaps this partly explains their determination to win, irrespective of the cost. What better way to set a precedent where the facts are against you but to totally outclass the opposition?
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Through the tactics of character assassination and false or misleading information they succeeded in convincing the judge that: nothing I said could be believed; I lit the fire; no claim had been lodged; the claim was fraudulent and exaggerated.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The insurance company did make an offer—$200,000—half-way through the hearing. An offer of this magnitude would have been considered generous in the 8 months following the fire, and acceptable up to the time we finally lost the business; till then the situation was salvageable.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When it was finally made, well over half the amount would have gone directly in legal costs, the balance covering only a fraction of what was still owed on leased equipment. Having lost plant, equipment, and customers, there was no "business" left to salvage and we would be bankrupted anyway.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The timing and amount of the offer can be compared with waiting until a damaged ship has sunk and then offering the materials needed to effect repairs.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Having won the first round, the insurance company is doing everything it can to stifle the matter, and ensure that there is no appeal. They have blocked disputing the decision by taking the matter back to court, and forcing us to supply security to cover their costs should we lose the appeal.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The amount involved is $45,000—based on $15,000 a day for an appeal hearing of 3 days.

        Anyone seeking to demonstrate how finance can overcome facts in our legal system would be hard pressed to find a better example.

        It is hardly surprising that my constituent is so disillusioned and cynical about a system which in theory is meant to provide equal opportunity and accessibility for and an even-handed approach to its treatment of both plaintiff and defendant but in practice does exactly the opposite. He has provided me with a very detailed and comprehensive commentary on the events leading up to the court case, various aspects of the evidence presented to the court, the manner in which it was presented and the judge's decision in the matter.

         I am not a lawyer, but much of what he has written makes very good sense. Many of his arguments are logical and believable. Many of his claims can be substantiated and many of the possible explanations he offers are quite reasonable and plausible. Despite the fact he may have excellent grounds for an appeal, he does not have, and has no prospect of obtaining, the $45,000 which the insurance company has sought as security for costs and which the court has agreed should be paid before the appeal can proceed. End of story.

         Most of us are familiar with the figure of Justice which adorns many of our court buildings—a very famous and once proud symbol which is now, sadly, perhaps best described as an anachronism. In the experience of my constituent, the perfectly balanced scales that Justice so confidently holds aloft should in fact be heavily weighed down on one side to represent the advantages that exist under the law for those who have the financial resources to exploit them. Rather than representing impartiality, her blindfold symbolises a legal system that has shut its eyes to the reality of a demonstrably unjust and unjustifiable situation. Fortunately for Justice, the weapon she grasps, her means of defending all that is right and fair, is a sword. Had it been a gun she would have almost certainly and with good reason shot herself in the foot by now.

         My constituent is not the only one who has been forced to learn the bitter lesson that a citizen's right to access the court system, particularly in regard to civil matters, depends not so much on the validity of their cause but on the size of their bank balance. It is a sad and sorry reflection on our legislators and legal practitioners that the old proverb about one law for the rich and another one for the poor still applies in Australia in 1994. I particularly include the legislators because it is too simple and too inaccurate to lay all the blame for the current inequities in our justice system at the feet of the legal profession. Certainly they are partly responsible, but only partly. In this context, the words uttered some 160 years ago by Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States, are still valid and worth repeating:

         The coal industry is, in effect, several industries. We are the world's largest coal exporter. Seventy per cent of our production goes to export. Accordingly, our industry, its workers and the firms that depend on the coal industry are very vulnerable to the changes in export prices. One would expect that, after almost 200 years of exporting coal, we in this nation would have developed some commercial maturity, some commercial sanity, some commercial advantage and some commercial strategy in how we mine and sell our coal—our major customers certainly have.

        The summary—the quotes from that report—points to the idiocy, almost the immaturity, of the Australian coal industry.

We are saying, `Wouldn't there be some semblance of maturity in the market—getting together and organising some commercial advantage to counter the negotiating muscle of the Japanese steel mills?'. As I have said, alas, there is nothing there at all. Clearly, we have a continuing case of organised buyers dealing with disorganised sellers.

         On top of that, the ultimate insult comes when we turn to the report of Akira Chimura, who wrote the article `Securing Supply to Meet Increasing Demand for Steam Coal' for the International Cooperation Department of the Institute of Energy Economics in Japan. Mr Chimura refers to the fact that sales of coal are likely to increase in Asia and that there may be loading holdups in some places and some constraint points. That is not new in the coal industry. Ships were queuing on the Australian coast for coal in the 1890s. There is nothing new about that. There are always peaks and troughs. One would have thought that, 200 years on, somehow Australian industry might just have gained a bit of commercial nous. It has not, and it cannot keep on blaming the people who work in the industry. They have been involved in change and have made sacrifices, but the benefits have gone straight into the pockets of the Japanese steel mills and the organised buyers abroad. The Chimura report, on page 11, states:

         If demand for steam coal in Asia does rise sharply in the future, then Australia will be in the position where its capacity to export coal will be restricted due to loading bottle-necks . . .

        That is a fallacy. I will not go into all of it, but the case made is wrong; it is out of date. The confession continues:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Consequently, unlike the case of coking coal, for steam coal there are no leading suppliers that can keep the price demands by Australian shippers in check. In contrast to the Australian coal shippers, Canadian coal shippers place greater emphasis on securing contract quantities than on demanding large increases in contract price, therefore, Japanese companies moved ahead with price negotiations with Canadian coal shippers, and through this, they were able to keep the coking coal price rise demanded by the Australian shippers to a much lower level.
       </para>
       <para>
        What a clever strategy. The Japanese companies knew what they were doing. Who are the mugs? The Australian sellers, the Australian industry. Another section on page 11 states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . many Japanese companies have invested in loading port management and operation organisations such as PWCS, so to prevent a tightening of the steam coal market and a sharp rise in prices, Japanese companies must give positive lateral support, especially in funds procurement, to these organisations in their efforts to expand the loading capacity of the ports they manage.
       </para>
       <para>
        These companies are saying, `Go out there; go down to these mugs down south; invest in their industry and in the loading facilities. Make sure there is continual growth and supply and growth and capacity. That way you, as buyers, can depress and hold down the legitimate price expectations of the nation of Australia, its industry and its workers'. They have actually excelled themselves in playing off one supplier against the other.

         In the past 10 years Japan has saved $31.2 billion in the purchase price of coal—one-fifth of our overseas debt. What happens in Australia with industry organisations? If anybody dares to suggest, `Let's get Australian industry organised, be like Australians and match our competitors, our buyers', he is decried: `How dare you suggest that you intervene in the market?'. We are not saying we ought to organise the market. But, for heaven's sake, the producers in the coal industry  should not be cajoled into opening up more mines, continually expanding supply and putting pressure on sales, causing underground mines and older mines to close.

         In one mine in my electorate—the Moonie mine, which closed last week—there are 15 million tonnes of good coal. Three mines have been closed in my electorate in about the last three years. All of the underground mines seem destined for that in association with the policy of the New South Wales government. But there is a greater responsibility here to this nation, to the reserves we have been blessed with, to those who come after us, to extract the maximum benefit for this nation from that asset we have. I call in this parliament on our government for an end to this open slather approach to the coal industry and the introduction of a clear, specific and responsible strategy for the mining and marketing of Australian coal.

         —There would be little dispute in this parliament that among the most notorious of the former communist regimes of eastern Europe was that of Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania. Ceausescu came to power in 1965 and retained an iron grip over Romania until Christmas Day 1989. On that day he and his equally evil wife, Elena, were executed after trial in the wake of a popular uprising by the Romanian people.

         Apart from the appalling hardship and cruelty Ceausescu inflicted upon his countrymen over a quarter of a century, his government persistently exported to the Western democracies terrorism, murder and drugs. Much of the criminal activity in these and other areas was organised by the brutally efficient Romanian foreign intelligence service, the DIE. The grisly international work of the DIE was well documented in the 1987 book
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Red Horizons
         </emphasis>
         , written by the former head of Romanian intelligence and defector to the West, Lieutenant General Ion Mihai Pacepa. Of course not all Romanian criminal activity overseas was state sponsored, but DIE involvement was certainly a catalyst, as was Ceausescu's emptying of Romania's gaols of most professional criminals in the 1980s. This was also about the time that Australia first encountered significant problems with migrants from Romania, for the limited number who had come to Australia from 1945 until the end of the 1970s settled well into Australia and created no noticeable law enforcement concerns.

         The greater number of this relatively small ethnic group has, like so many other ethnic communities, made a solid contribution to their adopted country. Nevertheless, from the early 1980s onwards substantial criminal activity has emanated from Romanians now living in Australia. Initial criminal activity was especially evident in the forgery of official and commercial documents, including drivers licences, passports, letterheads, letters of introduction and so on. The quality of these forgeries was very good, which clearly reflected the fact that many of the perpetrators had learnt their craft well from the DIE. These forged documents were largely used as the basis for false claims for various social welfare benefits.

         A multiplicity of Romanian criminal groups presently compete against each other fiercely for a share of the drug trade. Unlike some other criminal groups, they do not have a structured hierarchy that plans and implements operations overall. Romanian involvement in the drug trade centres largely on the distribution of heroin, though of recent types there have been indications of some trafficking in cocaine, marijuana and amphetamines. Arrests of Romanian drug traffickers show that the heroin seized with them is usually of a high level of purity—often 60 per cent to 85 per cent.

         Four of the Melbourne five—Dimitru Capatina, Vasile Chelariu, Dorel Varan and Petre Rebedia—are currently being held at the Maribyrnong detention centre pending assessment of their claims for refugee status by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The fifth Romanian stowaway, Ion Epure, is apparently the one most likely to be granted refugee status and has already been released, yet he is the one with the five dot, dice shaped tattoo on his hand that normally indicates that a gaol term has been served back in Romania. Also, while in Maribyrnong, Epure and certain of the others were visited by known and suspected drug traffickers. Despite these many disconcerting facts about Romanian criminals in Australia, only law enforcement agencies in New South Wales and, to a lesser extent, Victoria have conducted any investigative work into them of consequence on an ongoing basis.

         This dismal situation also reflects little credit on the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs' screening of migrants from Romania under this federal Labor government's period of office—now some 11 years. The time has arrived to literally start sorting the good from the bad before what is now a major law enforcement problem on Australia's east coast collapses into a catastrophe. I seek leave to table information on unique offenders which I obtained under my FOI request to the Victoria police and which I referred to earlier in my speech.

         —My grievance relates to the desperation of the opposition in its somewhat tedious pursuit of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in the so-called sports rorts affair. The opposition's desperation relates more to the fact that it lost the last election and that it has now lost its identity and its clarity of philosophy. The sad part is that those opposite think that their pursuit is a symptom of their virility as an opposition whereas in fact it, in effect, shows that they are really political zombies.

         The shire of Diamond Valley made an application for a grant for $100,000 on behalf of the Greensborough bowling club. The shire was prepared to put up $100,000 of its money to achieve the project's success. As you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a great lack of bowling facilities in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, particularly around the electorates of Jagajaga and Scullin. There are no bowling facilities in the Greensborough area, yet the demographic profile of the population in that area shows a very high proportion of older people compared to other areas in that region. The strength of the club is that it already has about 100 members, even though it does not yet have greens. People are joining the club in anticipation of it going ahead. That was the fact beforehand.

         The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has been caught out in this House by twisting the truth with innuendos of impropriety, just as he did on another occasion about matters in my electorate. It is not a new story. I would have thought that, if the opposition had been so concerned about this matter, let alone alert, it would have taken up this issue back in November 1992 when it was made public in Diamond Valley. At that time the story was not big enough to hit the national press, but it was certainly public in Diamond Valley. Senator Kemp and other members of the Liberal Party very keenly ran around trying to put together the greatest campaign in Liberal history to get the seat of Jagajaga. If it was such a big issue, why did they not pick it up then?

         As strange as it may seem, I have one thing in common with the honourable member for Higgins and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson); that is, we all supported applications under the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities grants for bowling clubs. The only difference is that I supported the program but the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Higgins did not. They supported projects in their electorates, but they did not have the guts back in 1992—in Jagajaga, or Higgins, or Wentworth—to say that they did not support that aspect of policy and that it would get the chop under Fightback.

So why did they not attack the program in all electorates back in 1992-93 instead of playing their games now? As I said, in 1992 this project was no secret in my electorate. I digress very slightly to note that the interesting part of this matter is that they were supporting clubs which already existed while I, along with many other people in a lot of other seats, was supporting facilities which needed to be built. That is part of the problem—they are quite happy to go out and give to those who have it, but they take umbrage at the fact that grants were given to clubs in order to service areas where no services existed.

         The honourable member for Higgins ran around on Friday, Saturday and Sunday trying to get another angle. He always does this a couple of days before parliament resumes. All he is doing is promoting himself. All the opposition is doing is trying to distract attention from its own problems. The reality is that it is a bit late—only about 14 months late—on this one. Why did it not wake up to it then if it was such a big deal? It was public. It did not need the honourable member for Higgins or some of the piranhas in the press to pick it out or an FOI request; it was there. That is what makes this thing such a farce.

Would every member of this place who has lobbied for a project to be upgraded or shifted or improved say that the minister or I was wrong and they were right? What rubbish! I can recall a number of times when members of the opposition came into my office with delegations, making big fellows of themselves, trying to get projects and things for their electorates, and they were given them, often against departmental advice, because of the force of the case they put. That is what our system is all about. That is why we have representative government.

          —Before I go on to the topic of my grievance, I wish to respond briefly to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples). If it is the case that he is not concerned with but rather supports the sports rorts type of approach to divvying up funds, I wonder whether he can explain why, for example, the safe Labor seat of Denison in Tasmania can get $593,000 when the total number of applications was worth $1.2 million and my electorate was able to get only $27,000 when we put in $1.4 million worth of applications. It is about discrimination of a politically biased nature, and that is what we are complaining about. Maybe he would like to explain how that can occur. How can one electorate, such as Denison, get $593,000 and four Liberal electorates, added together, get only $557,000? There is some sort of discrimination going on. That is what taxpayers are interested in.

          Today I wish to grieve on an issue which I think would be recognised by everybody in this country as one of great concern; that is, the nurturing of and caring for young people and children. In Western society, and in Australia as part of Western civilisation, one of the things we are all consciously aware of is that there are people in our communities who, for one reason or another, find themselves in difficulty and in need of social support. Often there is a great heartache associated with those people.

          Just to illustrate: the children might be homeless children, children involved in divorce or suicide, sexually abused children and so on. There is this fallout in our society which I think all of us have a great concern about. Yet I believe we as a country are unable to really focus on some of these crucial issues for young Australians. One of the things which really disappoint me about this parliament is that there appears to be—and I think the changes in the parliament which are occurring even exacerbate this—a lack of capacity for us to exchange ideas across the parliament for the benefit of this country. I think that is a great tragedy.

          In this particular debate I want to focus on the fallout that occurs in our society. Over the break I spent some time doing some research on this and I found that no matter where I looked in Western civilisation the picture could be painted very simply. The sore from social fallout in our society is getting bigger, the bandaids which governments can apply to that social fallout are getting smaller and the number of people that are being paid to put the bandaids on is getting smaller. Wherever we go—whether it be the United States, Canada, Australia, western Europe—we find a similar style of things occurring. In other words, we cannot keep up with the dislocation and the social fallout that are occurring in our society.

          There are 50,000 to 70,000 homeless children in Australia. About 800,000 of our children have been involved in the dislocation of their family through divorce since 1975. Many of those 800,000 children are going to grow up in fatherless homes. If this sort of tendency continues, instead of having fatherhood as something which is of vital importance to the nurturing of both our girls and boys, we will find that fatherlessness, not fatherhood, is more typical in this country—that is a great concern. Each year about 45,000 divorces occur in this country—children are involved in divorces; 160-odd teenage suicides occur; about 5,000 children aged from under five to 17 are sexually abused and about 5,000 children are physically abused.

         I think that is the crux of the matter—the debate needs to be one which is conducted in a compassionate and understanding way. The social science evidence is now coming in clearly from around the world, whether we like it or not—and we, as parliamentarians, as people and as leaders of this great nation of ours ought to heed it—that, compared with children from single-parent families, children who receive nurture in two-parent families are six times more likely to live in a financially adequate home and are two to three times less likely to have emotional and behavioural problems. The evidence is overwhelmingly coming in throughout the world that they are less likely to drop out of school, less likely to abuse drugs or be in trouble with the law. Not only that, we also find that children from intact families have a much lower risk of being abused physically or sexually.

          Many children who suffer the difficulties of family breakup do not bounce back after their parents' divorce or remarriage. We have this notion that the children will get over it. The evidence that is coming in is that they are not getting over it, the difficulties are being prolonged during their life and are having devastating effects on them. Children from functional families have a much easier time at achieving intimacy in relationships, in forming a stable marriage and even holding a steady job. Many of us did not think that these things would appear, but the reality is that if we do the research and the reading we will find this coming through.

          In summary: family breakup and divorce, even though they may benefit the adults involved, are invariably harmful to many children and are dramatically undermining our society. I think that we as members of parliament should start to focus on two facts. First, we have to underpin those people who are divorcing and who have a need, but on the other side of the equation there is a great need for the children in our society to be cared for, if at all possible, in two-parent families because the evidence is coming through that we are devastating future generations of this nation because adults are not putting in the time and the effort to care for and nurture their children.

         —I would like to direct my remarks today to the decision made by the Queensland government on 14 February to refuse the offer by the Commonwealth for the transfer of Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital to the state public system. It was a great disappointment that the Queensland government made such a decision as I do not believe that it was in the best interests of the people of Queensland.

         By any objective measure, Greenslopes hospital is an excellent facility providing first-class care to veterans, war widows and community patients. It is widely regarded by medical practitioners, administrators and patients alike as the best public hospital in Queensland and one of the best in Australia. There are a number key elements that have combined to achieve such a reputation: the dedication, ability and compassion of the staff—medical, nursing, ancillary and administrative; the first-class infrastructure and facilities provided; and the commitment to excellence at all levels in the delivery of care to patients.

         This is too valuable a facility to be lost to the public sector. The Queensland state health department needs to have such an excellent acute care teaching hospital included in its system. For this reason, I have written to both the state health minister, Ken Hayward, and the Commonwealth veterans affairs minister, Senator John Faulkner, urging them to come back to the negotiating table to sort out an arrangement on the issues which caused the Queensland government to reject the Commonwealth offer. I understand from a letter I received from Ken Hayward that Queensland was not happy with the financial arrangements which were to apply in the second five-year period from 1999 onwards. Surely, with goodwill and a commitment to the principle of integration from both sides, a reasonable compromise could be negotiated.

         I also appreciate that there currently exists an over supply of beds in this inner-southern region of Brisbane. The Princess Alexandra Hospital has over 600 beds and is on the border of my electorate and the electorate of Griffith. The Mater public hospital, with a similar number of beds, is only a kilometre or two from the PA. Greenslopes hospital, with 350 beds, is only two to three kilometres away. QEII hospital, with 200 beds, is another three kilometres south. Therefore, there is a need to rationalise the bed numbers and the facilities provided in this area as the demand here is much less than for faster growing regions, such as Logan City, the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast and Far North Queensland.

         In my discussions with the state minister over the past 18 months or so, I pursued the concept of utilising Greenslopes hospital for the expertise and excellence that it has developed as an acute aged care facility. I felt that it could become the specialised aged care hospital for the south side of Brisbane with the transfer of such responsibilities from existing old facilities at the PA hospital. I believe that this would have been a viable option and would have suited the Greenslopes hospital staff and the facilities. I am very disappointed that the state government did not spend more time and effort considering this option.

         The Commonwealth's offer to the state government was a generous one. The hospital and all its resources were to be handed over free to the state. Further, the Commonwealth guaranteed full recurrent funding for the first five years and case-mix funding for the subsequent periods. However, if we are unable to achieve further negotiations or a satisfactory outcome, the next option for the federal government is to offer the sale of Greenslopes to a private operator. This is not an option I prefer, but it is the next most viable alternative to integration into the state system. This has occurred with the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital in Western Australia. Its sale has been successfully negotiated with the Ramsay Health Care Group, which assumed responsibility this week.

         If this sale of Greenslopes is to proceed, certain requirements and guarantees need to be put in place to ensure that no-one is disadvantaged by the process. Firstly, I am pleased to note the guarantee provided by the state health minister that a privately owned Greenslopes hospital will be licensed by the state to operate fully and effectively as a private hospital. Mr Hayward advised Senator Faulkner of this guarantee last week in a telephone conversation and confirmed that fact to me in our own discussions on this issue. Therefore, we are able to proceed sure in the knowledge that the state government will honour its commitment.

         Secondly, the future of the staff and future care provisions for veterans and war widows are vital considerations. The government has already been through the process of negotiating an acceptable package for the staff who were at Hollywood hospital in Perth. Agreements satisfactory to the unions, the employees, the Commonwealth and the private operator were achieved and will provide a model for similar negotiations to occur in Queensland. However, it is important that the particular needs, views and requirements of the staff at Greenslopes hospital are sought, listened to and acted upon by the parties involved in any negotiations about a private sale.

This scheme gives improved options for local care to all eligible recipients.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, as you are aware, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 requires full capacity to implement beneficial changes to service pensioner assessment and to maintain the nexus of pensioner assessment with the Social Security Act. The problem is that the Senate amendment prevents the implementation of the managed investment amendments contained in the bill.

         The opposition wants to delay any amendment to the income and assets tests until the independent review of the income and assets tests for service and social security pensions hands down its recommendations. The government could not responsibly delay these amendments while awaiting the outcome of the review to become law. The government is keen to not make any major changes until the review has been reported.

         The measures contained in this bill benefit service pensioners. In particular, the managed investment amendments are to the advantage of service pensioners with these forms of investment. The measures clarify the operation of the existing legislation by ensuring that all losses from managed investments can offset profits from other managed investments; ensuring that, where an interim rate of return is declared, that return is applied and not an extrapolation of that rate; and by introducing a safeguard to prevent a change in the status of an investment company from affecting the assessment of investments made with that company.

         In the current economic climate, a number of friendly societies have changed status to life offices. No income is held on friendly society investments made before 1 January 1988 until the investment is cashed in or realised in some other manner. The existing legislation treats the conversion of a friendly society to a life interest as an action that realises the investment even though the pensioner has no control over the changes made to the friendly society and has not physically withdrawn an investment.

         Besides the managed investment amendments, other beneficial measures in the bill are the introduction of a seniors health card for non-pensioner retirees who meet an income test and certain residency requirements and assistance to families in providing greater flexibility in the delivery of child related payments—for example, the ability to redirect part of the veteran's child related payment to his former partner where the custody of the child is shared but the former partner is the primary care giver—and exemption as income of payments received from the new medically acquired HIV trust. Failure to pass the bill as a whole will result in a piecemeal and inconsistent approach to pension assessment by creating differences and maintaining anomalies between social security and service pensioners.

         The government has discussed this matter on a number of occasions. We have heard many comments from the opposition. We have tried to explain in a reasonable way to the opposition that at the moment we are trying to get consistency between social security and service pensioners. Those opposite know that these matters are being considered in an overall examination of the issues. It is simply quite extraordinary that they should insist on persisting with anomalies while we have already announced that there will be a review. We are trying to get consistency into the system. If the review suggests changes, then those changes will be taken on board, whether the changes are across the board for both social security and service pensioners or whatever it might be. This is a simple temporary measure to get some consistency into the system.

I concede that there are measures in this legislation which confer a benefit on veterans, but we have to look at all 72 pages of the amendment bill to reach a balanced judgment on whether we can live with that which does not confer a benefit but that which imposes, ahead of a major government review, a new arrangement with regard to managed investments.

         This is a legitimate, reasonable concern brought to our notice by veterans through the office of Senator MacGibbon and many others, including the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who has taken a deep interest in this matter. Their concern is that the government is stitching up a result ahead of the outcome of the major review. There is no real guarantee that, even if the review went another way and recommended another option, there would be legislation coming back to the House to reflect that and which would further amend part 7 of this amendment bill, the nub issue before the chair at this time.

         This whole area of managed investments is extremely complex. Not unrelated to this, although not directly embraced by part 7, is the form of notional capital gains tax which applies to service pensioners and other aged pensioners at this time, to which I am totally opposed. If they hold shares and those shares go up in value in the course of 12 months, their pension is reduced even though they may not sell those shares. That in summary form is what is involved with the government's notional capital gains tax applying at this time to service pensioners and aged pensioners. That is grossly unfair and is the thin end of the wedge.

I put it to the parliamentary secretary that there is a solution. It is embraced by his own words in this debate. The government is conducting a major review. It wants this legislation to go through ahead of that major review. Why not give further resources to that major review so that we can expedite it and then deal with this issue properly in light of the outcome of that major review?

         That is why I on behalf of the coalition express my concern for the government's position on Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). This bill was introduced and passed in this House, then amended directly in the Senate—not by request—and it is now before the House this day. This is the first time I have spoken on a bill returned from the Senate in consideration in detail with the mace in its top position rather than its lower position. Under the new standing orders these are some of the additional changes manifest in this House. They are of passing consequence, but what is not of passing consequence is the content and thrust of part 7 of this amending bill. It is an issue which veterans are, quite properly, very concerned about.

         Veterans would like to see the colour of the government's money, in the sense that they would like to see the outcome of the review and then see the legislative process embarked upon rather than, in a sense, writing a blank cheque ahead of the outcome of the review and the government, with no real undertaking, coming into the House with further amendments as the case may arise. For those reasons, the coalition is opposed to the submission of the parliamentary secretary on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill as amended by the Senate. We support the amendment put by the Senate to the House this day on this important measure.

         We are again opposed to and we do not accept the statement of reasons associated with disagreeing to the Senate's amendments. I do not want to unduly delay the House, but it is critical that the veteran, the service pensioner and the age pensioner be given a valid and workable assurance. The one way to truly protect their interest in this matter is to await the outcome of the government's major review before it puts in place part 7 of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) currently before this House, having been directly amended in the Senate.

        The Corporate Law Reform Bill is before the House because of an amendment made in the Senate to schedule 4, which provides for the insertion of proposed subsection 1274B into the Corporations Law. The purpose of this section is to enable a document that purports to have been prepared by the Australian Securities Commission from its national database by using a data processor to be admissible in a proceeding in a court as prima facie evidence of the matters stated in it without the need for certification of the document.

         The meaning of prima facie evidence is elaborated on in proposed subsection 1274B(2), which states that the writing is proof of such a matter in the absence of evidence to the contrary. The central purpose of this provision is to reduce substantially the circumstances in which routine and expensive formal certification of documents is required in court proceedings. It will thus address concerns raised by the Ministerial Council on Corporations by eliminating the need for formal proof, involving court attendances and the production of documents, of particulars that are readily available from the commission's database, ASCOT.

         It was the government's intention that the provision apply only to the ASCOT database and not include documents included in the ASC's national document imaging system, known as Docimage. The government believed that this objective had been achieved by the provision in the bill as originally drafted. However, the opposition expressed reservations both in this House and in the Senate as to whether the bill had put that matter beyond doubt. The addition of the words proposed to be included will have the effect of explicitly excluding from the operation of the provision any information obtained from the document imaging system.

         —The amendment moved by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) on behalf of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) was moved in the Senate by Senator Vanstone on behalf of the coalition. The amendment was agreed to by the government and passed by the Senate. The amendment applies to schedule 4 to the Corporate Law Reform Bill, dealing with the admissibility in court of documents on the ASC's national database. I was concerned with the potential scope of the proposed schedule 4 in the original form in the bill. The amendment seeks to clarify the scope of schedule 4.

         As I said in my second reading debate speech, the bill enables a document that purports to have been prepared by the ASC from the database by using a data processor to be admissible in a proceeding in a court as prima facie evidence of the matters stated in it.

         That is certainly not objectionable to the extent that the provisions facilitate the proof of formal matters, such as the incorporation of a company, the identity of directors and the existence of charges and the like. However, my concern was that the provision might be used to prove the truth of all matters stated within documents contained in the ASC's database. That might include the truth of annual accounts and the truth of assertions of fact made in annual reports. That would be quite inappropriate. That also appeared to be the intended effect on a reasonable reading of the provision in its original form.

         While it is open to the party against whom evidence is led, which might be called the other party, to rebut the prima facie effect of the evidence, it must be understood that not infrequently the affairs of a company or some other relevant matter may not be within the knowledge of the other party or any witnesses available to the other party. In those circumstances the other party would be dependent on cross-examination of a witness called by the party leading the evidence to rebut the prima facie effect of the material. Forcing the party asserting a fact to call a witness to prove the fact, in order to expose the witness to cross-examination, is a much used and often essential tactic to enable the truth to be elicited and justice done.

         During the debate of this bill in the Senate, I had occasion to discuss with officers of the Attorney-General's Department the intention of schedule 4. I was informed then that the provisions were designed to facilitate the proof of the more formal matters to which I have referred. I am told that category of information is contained on the ASC's ASCOT system, and the parliamentary secretary has just offered that explanation.

The amendment excludes from the definition of the `national database' the ASC's document imaging system.

         However, let me raise two potential difficulties which I suggest warrant further attention. The first is that the nature of the ASC's imaging system is not necessarily something that will be known to a reader of the statute nor is it likely to be something that will be fixed at the time the bill becomes an act. It is more likely than not to be something that would change in time. Similarly, what is contained on the ASCOT system, which is not referred to in the amendment, also, I would assume, will not be fixed as of the time that the bill becomes an act and therefore what is contained on the system may change. The effect of the statute would, on that basis, change.

         The point is that it is very difficult for anybody who is not part of the ASC's document and database management to know what is effective on production of a copy of it in a court under the provision. It is very difficult for anybody not part of the ASC's management of documents and its database to know what changes are effected. The difficulty arises because the amendment that was made in the Senate was made on the run, in effect. When an issue was raised, a misunderstanding, a misapprehension, of the intended effect of the provision as drafted was recognised and an attempt was made on the run to fix it. The attempt should be seen as nothing more than a stopgap measure. I urge the Attorney-General to take the matter back to his department with a view to having discussions with the ASC as to how to define the formal documents that, it seems to be agreed on both sides of the House, it is appropriate to tender on a prima facie basis in the manner contemplated in the bill without reference to something that nobody other than a few people operating the ASC database know anything about.

         This is not a matter of little moment because the proof of formal matters in civil litigation relating to corporations or civil litigation in which corporations are minor players is very common and prosecutions under the Corporations Law and companies and securities law are also very common. We are talking about a provision in a bill that will be given an everyday exercise in courts across the country and conceivably almost in every court in which that sort of litigation is being practised. It is an important matter and I urge that, in the interests of economy and efficiency and to avoid the necessity of every legal practitioner who seeks to tender a formal corporate document having to read both the Senate and the House of Representatives

         —On the face of it, the Ministers of State Amendment Bill is a very straightforward, simple piece of legislation most usually described as machinery legislation. It does, however, give the parliament the opportunity to also examine some other aspects of the ministerial representation in this House and the relationship between ministers and the parliament, questions relating to ministerial responsibility and the fundamental question of whether we are getting value for money for the ministers who are supposed to be paid out of this legislation.

         The second reading speech explicitly states that the rise is accounted for purely by the 1.4 per cent and the 1.5 per cent increments awarded to the Senior Executive Service personnel from March 1993 and March 1994. For that purpose, the legislation seeks that a further appropriation of $77,000 should be made available by the parliament. That would increase the total ministerial wages bill to $1,615,000. The point I draw to the attention of the House is that this $77,000 increase is not simply a 1.4 per cent or 1.5 per cent increase, as the second reading speech would lead to us to believe. It is a five per cent increase—almost double the increase provided by the Remuneration Tribunal for the Senior Executive Service, and for members and office holders of this House. The bill thus lifts the limit on ministerial salaries well above that 1.4 per cent and 1.5 per cent.

         The government's second reading speech is thus, to say the least, extremely misleading. I am informed that the 1.4 per cent rise from March 1993 is already paid to ministers from the surplus and the last limit placed on total ministerial salaries. I am also informed that the current bill before the House allows extra margin for future salary increases as well as for payments for acting ministers.

         There are two interesting components in this legislation. One concerns future increases. Has that normally been a procedure in past? Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table, may care to comment on that. As for the payment of assistant ministers, that is novel. It is certainly an interesting step forward, which the parliamentary secretary will perhaps benefit from because he has already given himself the title of assistant minister. These points are not mentioned in the second reading speech.

         The $77,000 or five per cent increase provided for in this bill, when divided between some 29 government ministers, is equivalent to an average pay increase of some $2,655 per minister. A five per cent increase on the Prime Minister's ministerial salary is equivalent to $5,500. Obviously, the government in this legislation is increasing the amount available for ministerial salaries for a future pay rise. The second reading speech is thus again misleading about the bill's purpose.

         I want to address the means by which ministerial salaries are determined, because it would appear to be somewhat unsatisfactory, to say the least. Section 66 of the constitution prescribes a maximum annual total which can be paid in ministerial salaries. This annual sum can only be increased by means of legislation such as this, which amends the Ministers of State Act 1952. Effectively the money goes into what can best be described as an imprest account. By contrast, increments awarded to the Senior Executive Service personnel and, by extension, to members of this parliament apply automatically to the back bench and parliamentary officeholders by the Remuneration and Allowances Act of 1990.

         The upshot of all this is that the Prime Minister and his cabinet in effect determine their own pay rises, quite distinct from pay rises or salary levels for members of parliament, for members of the Senior Executive Service and for office holders. The government says that the increase in the limit on ministerial salaries is to cover the 1.4 per cent and the 1.5 per cent pay rises for March 1993 and 1994 respectively. But clearly this is not true. There is thus nothing to stop the Prime Minister, following the passage of the bill, from disbursing the full $77,000 or giving a five per cent pay rise to his ministry. As I said, that would give him $5,500 additional salary.

         —The tribunal in its report of December 1993 made some very interesting observations on this subject. It said that ministerial salaries should stay at their current levels. It went further to say that `no alterations are desirable' and that salaries payable to ministers `should continue to be as set out hereunder'.

         The report contained a full statement of what it regarded as being adequate ministerial salaries. The report set out a table of ministerial salaries inclusive of the 1.4 per cent March 1993 increase. This is the increase which, according to the government and the second reading speech, we are supposed to be endorsing in this bill. But, in fact, the increase has already been paid. Thus the tribunal's report prima facie endorses the March 1993 increase but suggests that ministers should not be given the March 1994 increase of 1.5 per cent. It has been put to me that the tribunal was not ruling out the 1.5 per cent increase for March 1994 although, clearly, the literal meaning of the report would lead one to conclude that that was the case.

         I am prepared to accept this, although I believe that the tribunal may well have erred in two ways: firstly, it should have known of the government's desire to apply this 1.5 per cent increase to the ministerial salary component from March 1994 because the government's submission to the tribunal projected such an increase and, secondly, the tribunal should have known that a 1.5 per cent increase would apply to SES personnel and therefore to backbench and office holder salaries from March 1994.

         Consequently, the tribunal should also have known that the government's practice has been to apply the same increases to the additional ministerial salary component. The tribunal has not endorsed applying SES flow-ons to ministerial salary components, although it has in effect rubber-stamped the resulting salaries. One could argue that the tribunal was indeed advising against the Prime Minister and his cabinet applying the March 1994 1.5 per cent increase to their salaries. While this may not be so, this is the literal sense of the tribunal's report and there is no evidence against  such  an interpretation  since  the tribunal  makes  no  comment  on  the  practice of applying SES increments to ministerial salaries.

         But, unmistakably, it is the tribunal's strong recommendation that ministerial salaries should increase no further; certainly no more than any increment awarded to SES personnel and backbenchers. Yet, as I have stated, this legislation represents a five per cent increase which is topping off the funds available in what I described as the imprest account, which can obviously therefore be used for future ministerial increases presumably at any time to suit the government and the Prime Minister.

         Therefore, it is inappropriate that this bill should give the government a large surplus which can be applied to ministerial salaries if and when the Prime Minister wishes. As I stated earlier, the bill does increase the amount paid in salaries by five per cent—that is, $77,000. According to the Department of Administrative Services, the March 1993 1.4 per cent increase, which supposedly is covered by this bill, has already been paid. The only prospective increment is the 1.5 per cent rise payable from this March. This means that the bill before the House could contain a surplus of up to 3.5 per cent, or some  $54,000. I have not yet been able to have that amount verified by the department. This would be equivalent to about a further $1,900 a year increase per minister.

         For the reasons outlined above, the opposition therefore will be moving an amendment which will limit the amount of money available for ministerial salaries to no more than is necessary to cover the 1.5 per cent increase due to take effect from March 1994 and to allow for any contingencies. We do not believe the Prime Minister and his cabinet should have some extra amount available to disburse to themselves. We will also be moving an amendment expressing our disgust that the Prime Minister will be giving ministers such as the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) a pay rise which clearly they do not deserve.

         The performance of the Keating ministry, evidenced by the pay TV fiasco, the Thai teak tables, the Gould prints, the scandals and the sports rorts, clearly suggests to the average Australian—who has had a pretty limited salary increase in recent times, if any at all—that the government has not on any criteria of performance earned any further additional pay rise. As far as the Gould print fiasco is concerned, we should, in fact, be saying to the Prime Minister that his wage rise should be garnisheed, so that he would pay back to honest Australians the $40,000 he caused to be overspent in buying his bird prints for the walls of the cabinet office—prints seen only by those galahs who sit at the table.

         I want to make a few observations about ministerial responsibility because I think it is particularly relevant in this context. Sir Ivor Jennings, who was a well-known and learned jurist and one of the fathers of constitutional reform in the English speaking world, had some observations to make about how ministers should perform. He said that a minister's value to his department will be greater if he does not try to deal with everything, `for his essential function is to relate the policy of the department to the general policy of the Government and if he immerses himself in departmental duties he becomes not a minister but a very senior administrator'.

         I think they are very sound words indeed. It is interesting to compare what he had to say with what the Prime Minister had to say on the question of accountability. I quote from a speech given by the Prime Minister on 1 July 1993 in relation to performance and accountability in the Public Service. Among other things, he said:

        If ministers are not responsible before this parliament, which is the representative of the Australian people, who are? As we saw in the Beddall and Collins affair, it was the secretary and senior officers of the department who ultimately had to carry the can. The claim was that the minister had not been adequately briefed and automatically informed. However, we were also told that the minister did not make any serious effort to bring himself up to date with what was going on and effectively left the running of this key area of policy in the hands of his department.

         By any reading of the comments made by Sir Ivor Jennings or the Prime Minister, one would have to conclude that at the very least we are talking about severe dereliction of responsibility. When we talk about making decisions on whiteboards and about seeing documentation that has been tabled in this House from the secretary to the minister's own department which clearly stated, `We are getting into trouble, but we do not believe there is anybody in the minister's office who will listen to us', we see again how the conception of ministerial responsibility under this tired and worn-out government is looking very threadbare indeed. When we reach a situation where ministers can apparently make decisions on thousands and thousands of taxpayers' dollars sitting in the back of a Commonwealth car going between A and B, the position is not just ludicrous; it is tragic in terms of the fundamental principles of sound public administration. Unfortunately, that is the situation that this country, as presently administered by Labor, is now in.

         There are other points which need to be made in this particular context. I refer specifically, once again, to the so-called sports rorts affair. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories failed even to satisfy the concerns of her own department which, as I said earlier, warned that it was `vulnerable', and that is its word, in relation to the exercise of its responsibilities and sought to `copper bottom'—that is very appropriate indeed when one is being eaten by the molluscs—itself against the swirling cauldron of the minister's office.

         One of the characteristics of both the Hawke and Keating governments which future administrative historians will write about is the tendency for ministers to establish huge bureaucracies within their offices and effectively try to run policy to varying degrees independently of line management within departments.

It is marvellous what one can achieve with those little neurones. This brings us to the other question as to whether or not the Australian people are getting value for money from this government.

         When we see the analysis of this in terms of staff, the position becomes even clearer. The number of personal staff serving this government and its ministers has doubled since 1983. We would again have to ask: has the quality of government doubled? Has the quality of service to the Australian people doubled? A great shout will come from people out there saying, `No'. If anything, the Australian people feel more isolated, more deserted by their federal bureaucracy and federal parliamentary system than ever before.

         The cost of salaries for the ministerial entourage appears to have trebled, not just doubled. The cost of employing those people has actually gone up by 300 per cent. One of the reasons is that they are on higher basic salary grades. Based on official estimates, the salary bill for all staff devoted to ministers is now some $30 million a year. If the staff alone cost $30 million, the total cost is probably close to $50 million or $60 million. This includes personal staff, consultants, public servants working exclusively for the minister, the National Media Liaison Service and the ministerial media group. According to the government's own report, salaries for ministers' staff total $17.6 million in 1991-92 and $19.3 million in 1992-93. This includes only ministerial staff, not consultants, departmental liaison officers and the like. This leads us to other interesting questions.

         Official figures, which I have tabled before, show that since 1983 the government has granted itself almost 200 new staff for ministers and other office holders. The total number of staff attached to ministers—the Media Liaison Service, parliamentary secretaries and other office holders—has now risen from 220 in 1983 to 416 in June last year. In the same period the government allowed the shadow ministry 26 more staff, taking the opposition's staff to the grand total of 72. I also make the point that the backbench committees of the government have staff supplied to them by the government on the government's payroll. Backbenchers in the opposition get nothing. We get no staff. We get no funds for that purpose whatsoever.

The government has been seeking an additional $912,000 on top of its $3,684,000 appropriated in the last budget to cover additional visits abroad. That will bring the total amount spent on ministerial travel to $4.6 million for 1993-94. I think it is the highest figure it has ever been. It has increased steadily under the Keating government from $3.48 million in 1991-92, $4.16 million in 1992-93 and now $4.6 million this year. That represents a 32 per cent increase in two years.

Nobody in this House would, in any sense, decry the need for and the right of the Prime Minister to travel to both of those conferences, but I find it extraordinary that in just two trips, albeit in a Commonwealth jet provided by the Royal Australian Air Force, one can justify spending almost a million extra.

         My whole case stands on the fundamental principle that the time has come for a clear exposition from this government, not only on the question of ministerial responsibility, which has clearly been thrown out the window, but also in relation to the more fundamental question of whether all ministers should be paid more at the wish of the Prime Minister when on the public record and in the eyes of the community many of them should be paid less. In fact, if they were in the private sector they would not get a job at that sort of salary level at all. That is the fundamental reality of it. Ministerial responsibility is a very heavy and very enduring responsibility.

On 18 January of that same year the invitation to tender was published. On 29 January the Prime Minister intervened and the tenders were terminated. On 4 February Mr Kerry Stokes appealed against the government's decision in the Federal Court. On 7 April Stokes won the appeal and tenders were reopened. On 17 April, serious flaws were found and the tender was cancelled again. That is a small example of this whole question of ministerial propriety that I am referring to.

         I do not know whether the honourable member for Bradfield read the second reading speech of the parliamentary secretary. The purposes of this legislation were quite clearly indicated in that second reading speech. In that second reading speech—I will go through this because it is of critical importance to the whole question that we are considering at this time—the parliamentary secretary said:

        Nothing could be clearer, fairer or more objective than that. I am sure that in less passionate moments the honourable member for Bradfield would repudiate some of the suggestions he made, but some of his concerns are best addressed as a result of legislation of this kind. I am not giving any credibility to the claims he made about some of the ministers of this government, all of whom have established a magnificent team, but were there some credibility in the suggestion that one should, by whatever means, examine the effectiveness and efficiency of ministers before granting them any increase, then I suppose we could probably do the same in determining whether there should be any reduction. I suggest to the honourable member for Bradfield that that is a very dangerous track to go down at any time. Even if we were to give some credence to that sort of proposition, we could well extend it to office-holders in the opposition, for example. We could well extend it to the salaries that are being earned by that overflow of shadow ministers, the 37 who flood along that front bench.

         As the parliamentary secretary indicated, the purpose of the legislation is simply to maintain those relativities—a sensible, objective and fair approach to take. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall—not from your personal knowledge but certainly from your knowledge of history—that when Mr Justice Higgins brought down his famous Harvester award in 1904 he set the basic wage at $4.20. The ABS has a current all-persons, all-industry award rate which at the present time is $460.08 a week. That is 110 times higher than the basic wage back at the time of the writing of the constitution or a few years after its adoption.

         Of course, the relevance of this is that—reference has been made to the constitution—section 66 of the constitution prescribes a maximum annual sum for the payment of salaries to ministers. It states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . an annual sum which, until the Parliament otherwise provides, shall not exceed twelve thousand pounds a year.

        In dollar terms, that is $24,000. If we were to use that same provision in the constitution as the index for payment of ministers now, the total would be not $24,000, as was provided for originally, but $2,640,000. That is the total provision for all of the 30 ministers we now have. If we divide that amount by 30, we finish up with a ministerial supplementary salary of $88,000 each. That is considerably in excess of the amount they are being paid under these arrangements.

         We should also take into account that at the time of federation when the constitution was adopted not only was the parliament significantly smaller than it is at the present time but the ministry was as well. That #12,000 or $24,000, which was the maximum provided at that time, represented a ministerial salary supplement for a much smaller group. If we were to extend that to the present time, I do not think there is any doubt at all that the supplementary salary for ministers would be significantly higher than it is at the present time and significantly higher than is being provided for here.

         I said that I would also take the opportunity to clarify what appears to have been some misunderstanding. The honourable member for Bradfield suggested that the increase should be limited to 1.5 per cent. That is the 1.5 per cent that would apply from 10 March this current year. But in the increases which have taken place there is also the 1.4 per cent which needs to be applied and to be effective from 11 March 1993. Both of those are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of maintaining those relativities.

         We should never diminish the importance, even though in the interchange, the flow of political rhetoric, between government and opposition we sometimes do—both the honourable member for Bradfield and I recognise this—that out of 17 million people in Australia there are about 30 who occupy ministerial positions. There is a heavy responsibility on those people, just as those opposite are responsible to the coalition to ensure that they provide an effective opposition, as they will continue to do. They will continue to seek to provide an effective opposition until, as I say, perhaps the year 2076 or something like that.

A panel would be established comprising members of the opposition to oversee and approve any proposed increase within the terms of the legislation and arrangements which have been put into place to ensure appropriate increases for ministers. Would we then accept their judgment? We may well reciprocate by establishing a similar group to determine whether or not members of the opposition, and particularly office holders of the opposition, frontbench members of the opposition, are worthy of the salary which they are receiving.

         It is unfortunate that members of parliament, whichever side they are on, would take up as a public issue whether it is appropriate for salaries to be determined in this way. We all remember the circumstances in the past when in effect members of parliament made arrangements, provisions, for their own salaries—and the public had a right to be concerned about that. In order to take it out of the political arena, it was decided and, with much bipartisan support, generally agreed that it was a more appropriate affair—a more just, sensible, equitable transparent arrangement—to fix parliamentary salaries and attach them to an appropriate level within the Public Service. That is what we did. Now we get to a situation where, for reasons best known to themselves, those opposite seek to adopt a different position on the issues.

         The honourable member for Bradfield in his contribution also made reference to the sports grants issue which has occupied far too much of this parliament's time. I make a few observations about that. I do not know why members of the opposition should be so suspicious about a minister exercising ministerial discretion as he or she is expected to. I suppose one of the reasons they would presume some sort of ministerial impropriety in connection with grants would be that members of the coalition when in government, whether at federal or state level, are experts at pork-barrelling.

If a minister fulfils his or her responsibility in making decisions on behalf of the government and in the context of government programs and appropriations without fraud, without anything untoward in the allocation of those funds, then that minister is quite clearly acting correctly. There is no requirement for any minister to adopt any particular procedure or to maintain any particular records. They have a responsibility to make decisions. In connection with the matter that has been raised by members of the opposition, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories quite obviously made the decisions in regard to the responsibilities with which she was charged.

It is the first day when, under new standing orders, ministers are not available for every question time. The standing orders have been so changed—not with unanimous consent of both sides of the House but by arbitrary fiat of a government that has the majority in this House. The fact that the government has changed the standing orders on the basis of its numbers and not by way of unanimous consent, which is the normal parliamentary practice under which changes to sessional orders and standing orders are adopted, means that we are now operating under a new regime. The regime is one which, as far as the Ministers of State Amendment Bill is concerned, goes to the very heart of ministerial or executive responsibility to the parliament.

         This bill seeks to appropriate an additional amount of money to pay ministers' salaries. This bill was introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Sciacca). I find it extraordinary that the legislation was introduced by one who receives no benefit from it—by a parliamentary secretary who, like members of the opposition frontbench, does not receive any additional salary. For that reason, they are not covered in the bill.

         It is all very well for the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) to talk about providing some great check and balance through the salary restraint which the government is going to exercise on members of the opposition frontbench. But they receive no additional salary. So let us be realistic about this matter. It relates purely to the salaries of those who are ministers of state; the act itself says so. The Ministers of State Act 1952 has been changed by adding the amount of money which is available to pay ministerial salaries.

The whole nature of this matter is to grab it and run. Frankly, that is not good enough.

         It needs to be registered that the cost of those staff to the taxpayer is something like $30 million a year. That is really what this is about—it is not just this increase in ministerial salary; it is the way in which the staff is being augmented at the same time as the bureaucracy at the higher levels is being augmented. We have seen a distortion. The advisers within the ministerial offices are getting a very significant additional amount of money—$30 million—and within each of the departments there is a similar blow-out. Instead of there being an increase in the lower levels so that those who are unemployed or who might reasonably seek an opportunity for the first few years of their working lives, perhaps post-university, to be involved in the wider field of learning how the Public Service works, there is very little chance for them to do so.

         In our day, the departments of finance and treasury were split. Previously there was a Treasurer with a secretary and two deputy secretaries; now there is a Department of the Treasury, with three deputy secretaries, and a separate head of Finance, with two deputies. Overall numbers in the Senior Executive Service have increased. There is another category, known as senior officers, which comprises the three grades immediately below the Senior Executive Service. These officers are paid between $47,000 and $58,000 a year before bonuses. Although the total staff has fallen in the Department of Finance, for example, the big increase is in those senior officer levels.

         At the lower level there has been a reduction in numbers. Although government members can come into this place and say, `We have fewer members in our department', the reality is that there has been an incredible increase in the number of people employed at higher levels. The only place that this has been exceeded is in the nonsensical government in the ACT—formerly a minority within a big department; now, suddenly, it has many permanent heads. The explosion of staff has meant that every resident of Canberra now pays a grossly exorbitant charge just to satisfy the aspirations of those who now see themselves as equal to every senior public servant in every state and in the federal government.

         The explosion in the number of senior officers in the department is such that there are now fewer opportunities for young people entering the Public Service in the lowly ranked jobs and there are more people in the senior officer positions within the overall staff of the bureaucracy or the Australian civil service. When we combine that with the increase in ministerial staff, which, as my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield has pointed out, has gone up by something like 200 per cent since this government came to office, we find that there has been an almost 8:1 increase in government staffing levels in contrast to opposition staffing levels. The number of government staff positions in ministerial offices—and we are talking about more pay for ministers—has increased by almost 200, from 220 in 1983 to over 400 today.

And well we might ask, for, although this is not specifically the subject of this legislation, this House really needs to relate salary to performance. As far as I am concerned, the present behaviour of the ministry leaves a great deal to be desired.

         There is no doubt that two ministerial office-holders are under scrutiny at the moment—one by the Australian Federal Police and the other faced with a series of fundamental unanswered questions about a whiteboard. I find it quite fascinating that we have members in this place, including the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who are prepared to defend the practice of using a whiteboard to explain mathematical calculations. If any taxpayer in Australia were to give that answer to the Australian Commissioner of Taxation, he or she would be not only laughed out of court but also called before court and fined for not providing adequate records.

         I am concerned that this measure, which ordinarily people on this side of the House would see as no more than a normal way by which to attract the very best of the Australian populace into politics, and which most of us would normally support, comes on a day when new standing orders and the failure of ministers to attend and accept proper accountability have been put into place. It is a time when the Prime Minister has slunk from this House after question time, refusing to answer proper questions put to him about matters pertaining both to his behaviour when he was Treasurer and to his exercise of the office of Prime Minister. It is a day when two ministers are under scrutiny and when we have a blank introduction of a requirement to increase the salary of ministers. Frankly, it does not add up. We cannot have increased ministerial accountability and increased pay for the exercise of the office when ministers themselves are not performing up to public expectations.

         There is concern because, more and more, the executive is seeking to withdraw itself from the role that it properly holds as elected office-bearer of the Australian parliament. All of us know that we have a different system from that which pervades the United States, whose administration is separate from the legislature. The separation is quite distinct, according to its constitution and the electoral system. In our system, that does not apply. All ministers, with the exception within our constitution whereby a person can be a holder of a ministerial office for a period of up to three months before becoming an elected member of parliament—but that is an exception rather than a rule—are bound by the requirement of a continuum between the membership of the ministry and the membership of parliament. This bill relates to the fact that ministers of state are part of the legislature. The government is asserting that, because members' salaries have gone up, the salaries of ministers of state should be increased.

There has been an explosion in the number of ministerial staff. There has been an explosion in the number of senior office bearers within the Australian civil service. There has been a very significant increase in the amount of money they receive—$30 million a year to ministerial staff, and I guess probably even more within the Australian Public Service.

         I want to make a number of points which need to be made to answer the opposition's allegations. As I said, that publicity-hungry honourable member for Bradfield has once again used grossly incorrect figures to score some cheap political points. On 10 March 1994 the government will be increasing ministerial salaries by the same percentage increase as all parliamentarians will receive. As usual the honourable member for Bradfield has failed to point out that the increase he is complaining about is one which he will receive automatically as an MP, as will the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the only difference is those opposite already have it appropriated.

         The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 1994 does not seek to increase ministers' salaries; it is an appropriation bill to meet the costs of those salaries. After the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 was enacted, the government decided in May 1990 to limit ministerial salary increases to the same percentage increases awarded by that act to senators and members. The opposition office holders automatically received the salary increases, which they are now attempting to deny to ministers. The Australian Public Service workplace bargaining agreement of December 1992 provided for increases of 2 per cent in 1992, 1.4 per cent in March 1993 and 1.5 per cent in March 1994. The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 1994 reflects the need to appropriate additional funds of $50,000 in 1993-94 and a further $27,000 thereafter to meet the full year effect of these increases. This appropriation will enable ministers to receive an annual increase of $725 from 10 March 1994. Similarly, the Prime Ministerial salary will increase by $1,658 per annum. The increases quoted by the honourable member for Bradfield are, therefore, a sad reflection on his mathematical ability. Funds for the same percentage increases for opposition and other office holders are automatically provided under the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990.

         The honourable member for Bradfield appears to be suggesting that the government's performance does not warrant a pay increase. If one were to use that criteria, and it depends on who would be the arbiter of such a decision, I would suggest that the salaries of the opposition, particularly given the matters that were mentioned by the honourable member for Charlton, would end up being decreased. I will not say that they will be decreased to absolutely nothing but the opposition's supporters out there in the electorate are very sad about the performance of most of the opposition's front bench members. We are back here in government and members of the opposition are still over there. In terms of performance, the proof is in the pudding.

         The honourable member for Bradfield attempts to combine the March 1993 and the March 1994 increases to suggest a massive pay hike for the Prime Minister and ministers. By combining the 1.4 per cent and 1.5 per cent increases and the corresponding increase to back bench salaries, he appears to have manufactured his $2,600 per annum average increase for ministers, which he mentioned in his press release, and $5,500 for the Prime Minister. The opposition office holders automatically receive increases to their additional salary components under the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990. The March 1994 increase for the Leader of the Opposition, for example, will be $854 per annum compared with $725 per annum for ministers.

         The funds sought to increase the appropriation for 1993-94—that is what they are—will therefore also provide scope for acting arrangements.

A small amount is included for contingency arrangements, such as when there are changes in ministers. An instance is Mr Dawkins's resignation, where another minister took over on the same day.

         There are a number of other matters. The honourable member for Bradfield talked about ministers' staff costs. Again, he was selective in his use of figures. He tried to mislead the public. The honourable member has tried to score points through his recent media releases by suggesting that the number and costs of ministerial staff have significantly increased since 1983. He has used these media releases to mislead the community.

         This government has strictly monitored ministerial staff members and has introduced a series of measures to contain expenditure. Unlike the Fraser government, we have made a point of ensuring that all costs are revealed by providing details to the parliament by way of regular releases of costs to the press. We believe in accountability and we always table these figures.

         But the honourable member for Bradfield claimed that the government has only provided the opposition with 26 more staff members. He tried to somehow make a big point of that. I do not know whether he knows this, but we are the government, and the government is governing. Logically, it needs more staff to govern. It is completely illogical for him to suggest that somehow there has to be a correlation in relation to the increases in staff for ministers and opposition office holders. It just does not make sense. Those opposite are trying to dig up dirt against the government. We have to run the government.

         I think we can see from that that a bit of magical arithmetic has been used by the honourable member for Bradfield. When he looks through all the newspaper clippings every morning, he finds that the press always writes that stuff. Let us face it: what does the press have to write about at the moment? The government is going tremendously well and the opposition has leadership problems. All we read about is when the Leader of the Opposition is going to get the chop. What do those opposite have to do? They have to get the old shovel out and dig a bit of dirt, not realising that they are putting dirt on themselves at the same time.

         The honourable member for Bradfield then talked about the cost of overseas travel. This has received a lot of media attention over the last several weeks. Ministers are required to travel overseas to fulfil responsibilities on behalf of the Australian government on matters affecting the interests of the nation in world affairs. It is not a case of ministers travelling overseas and spending more on their visits, as all visits must be approved by the Prime Minister and all costs are carefully scrutinised.

       <para first-indent="16">

         All travel must be essential or be of great benefit to the nation. In recent years, the cost of overseas visits has increased in part due to the change in the exchange rate for the Australian dollar. It is expected that expenditure on ministers' overseas visits will be approximately $4.9596 million in 1993-94.

         During 1993-94, costs for overseas travel have included a number of visits by the Prime Minister and other ministers using RAAF special purpose aircraft. The department is required to meet the operating costs of these aircraft when used by ministers and other entitlees, including the opposition, either in Australia or overseas. Costs met in 1993-94 include a substantial amount for RAAF aircraft used on overseas visits.

         In 1993-94, expenditure on RAAF aircraft has been higher than in previous years due to the Prime Minister's personal attendance at international meetings, including the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the Asia-Pacific Economic Council meeting in Seattle in the United States of America. Therefore, it is laughable that the opposition appears to be suggesting that Australia's relationship with the international community would best be served by restricting the Australian government's capacity to meet and talk with people outside Australia.

         There is no question that, as a result of various meetings that the Prime Minister has attended in areas of Asia and the APEC conference in Seattle, the economic benefits that will flow to this country will be enormous. Honourable members should remember that the financing of a lot of this travel is considered to be robbing Peter to pay Paul; in other words, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) gets the money from the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator McMullan). At the end of the day, whatever is spent will be an absolute trickle in the ocean compared to the benefits of it. The honourable member for Bradfield, by his own admission, knows that to be the case, so he cannot whinge and have it both ways.

         Another matter which the honourable member for Bradfield brought up which I should comment on is the Remuneration Tribunal's observations in its 1993 determination. By way of background, the Remuneration Tribunal has a statutory responsibility to report on the levels of additional salary payable to ministers. In its December 1993 reports and determinations, the Remuneration Tribunal recommended that the additional salaries of ministers should be those currently payable.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The current rates result from the application of the government's 30 May 1990 decision that ministers' salaries increase at the same rate and at the same time as increases for senators and members. The rates recommended by the tribunal are those payable on and from 10 March 1993, when they were increased by 1.4 per cent.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The point of concern to the honourable member for Bradfield and the opposition, I presume, is that the tribunal's recommendation contains this statement:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . that no alterations are desirable and that the rates per annum of salaries payable to Ministers of State should continue—

        The honourable member for Bradfield argued that the government, by increasing the salaries of ministers by 1.5 per cent on 11 March 1994, is acting against the advice of the Commonwealth high salaries body established by the parliament to advise the government on the rates of salary payable to ministers. I take it that that is exactly what he is suggesting.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I think he should be aware of the following points. The tribunal's report on the salaries payable to ministers is an advisory report and not a binding determination. The report does not override the government's 30 May 1990 decision that ministers' additional salaries shall be paid at the same rate and at the same time as increases for senators and members and parliamentary office holders. The salary increase of 10 March 1994, for which funds are sought in this bill, will be paid at that time.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I understand that the tribunal's secretariat has advised that the tribunal's report merely states the salaries applying at the date of the report—that is, 21 December 1993—and is not in any way intended to preclude any subsequent increases payable under the government's decision. The report merely indicated the prevailing rates in order for the tribunal to fulfil its statutory reporting obligations.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The preceding point is supported by the tribunal's report of 8 April 1992 which stated that the relationship established between ministers' salaries and backbench salaries following the passage of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 should remain in place. Those details are provided on pages 9 and 10 of the tribunal's 1992 review. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bradfield is not accepted by the government. The first part of the amendment reads:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the increased sum for the payment of salaries of Ministers of State should be limited . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The increased sum contained in the bill only takes into account the Australian Public Service pay rises plus a reasonable amount for contingencies. I explained that to the honourable member. The second part of the amendment, which is even more interesting, states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . Ministers of State of the current Government should not receive automatic annual salary increases without due regard being paid to the performance of their functions as Ministers.
       </para>
       <para>
        How could the honourable member possibly be so silly as to put up something like that? Who is going to be the arbiter of what the performance is? Of course the opposition will always say that we are not doing a good job. Of course those people who vote for the Liberal Party will say that we are not doing a good job. I guess the same thing would happen if the situation were reversed, whether it be at the next election, at the election after that or at the election in 20 years time. I would suggest it will probably be 40 years time the way opposition members are going over there. How can we possibly put something like that into statute?  It would be an absolute absurdity.

         In closing this debate, I will give this promise to the honourable member for Bradfield: if the government can be certain that we can tie salaries to the performance of opposition members as well, we might give the matter some consideration.

         —by leave—I would like to clarify and add to the statement I made to the House in answer to a question earlier today regarding calls for a total ban on the manufacture and distribution of landmines. The Australian government supports controls and restrictions on the use of certain landmines. Australia itself does not manufacture or export anti-personnel mines, but it supports those countries which have prohibited the export of anti-personnel mines to countries which are not party to the inhumane weapons convention.

         The deliberate targeting of civilians or indiscriminate use of mines so that they injure civilians clearly contravenes international law and should be effectively banned. Australia is at the forefront of countries calling for a review of the 1980 inhumane weapons convention to make sure of this. We are also considering how other rules in the convention could be strengthened to eliminate the problem of mines being left unexploded at the end of hostilities which inevitably endangers civilians; for example, by the use of self-neutralising mines, obligations to mark and record minefields and to cooperate in demining.

         —Mr Speaker, you will be aware that, since entering parliament, I have sought to give the electors of Cowan an opportunity to express their opinions and concerns directly to parliament. This evening I would like to continue that process by expressing the concerns of Mrs Lorraine Mills of Koondoola, Western Australia. The comments directed to me by Mrs Mills deal with the continuing tragedy associated with Australia's record levels of unemployment and the insidious effect this is having on the psyche of Australians, particularly young Australians. Mrs Mills writes:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Last evening I happened to view "A Current Affair" on Channel Nine. A story was shown on a group of unemployed people residing in Mildura, who are refusing to take seasonal work picking grapes.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The viewer was told that Mildura has an unemployment rate of 18% and currently there are jobs for 7000 grape pickers. The orchardists cannot get people to fill those vacancies.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        One gentleman said "It is not the right of the unemployed to solve any problems the CES might have in filling vacancies". A young lady said that the unemployed have rights and that she did not have to do anything if she did not want to.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The orchardist blamed the ease with which people may obtain benefits and the amount of those benefits as the main reason they are unable to get workers.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The unemployed said it was too hot to work picking grapes, it was dirty work and it was preferable to do nothing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mrs Mills goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am very very angry. I have worked since leaving school in 1965. Even when my two sons were young, I took a night job, waitressing, to bring in extra money. My husband also worked at a second job as well. We did this as we wanted to improve our lot in life. For the last almost twelve years we have run our own business, starting in the recession of 1982. We work long hours and the work is hot and dirty. We now employ five men, two of whom have successfully completed apprenticeships with us.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Why should my taxes be wasted in such a manner? I am quite happy for the Government to assist the genuine needy and unemployed. However I strongly object to my taxes being used to pay unemployed people to sit at home or in the park or in the pub and do nothing.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The system in my opinion is long overdue for change. It appears to me that Australia through its Department of Social Security has become a very benevolent country, paying people to do nothing, paying teenagers so they may leave home when they can receive more benefits. Yet, people my age are being told after years of paying taxes that we must look to providing for our own retirement, as there won't be the funds available for us.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is absolutely crazy. We are by our own benevolence creating a generation of people who have no desire to work, have scant regard for the needs of their fellow man, who are quite happy to take all the benefits available and then complain loudly when society asks something in return.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We must do something to put a stop to this continued wanton waste of taxpayers money. Whether the system which operates in the USA could be adopted here, I don't know. Perhaps a system could be introduced whereby an unemployed person must perform some type of work in order to continue to receive benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mrs Mills continues with criticism of her present Labor government and its attempts to resolve our unemployment situation by saying:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I heard on the radio this morning that the Prime Minister has plans for 450,000 jobs at below the award wages for the first year, to encourage employers to put on more staff. If the unemployed in Mildura are a good cross section of the unemployed in Australia, then the news is all bad for Mr Keating. He may well get willing employers, but the unemployed will prefer to stay that way.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have . . . written to Mr Beazley in relation to another matter, Jobstart. However, it took many phone calls to his office and three months before I received a reply, which was stock standard in its format and ignored the basis of my letter. So, I feel under the circumstances it would be a waste of time to write to him on this issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The frustrations that Mrs Mills has spoken of are the same frustrations that many Australian families endure every day. The human face of unemployment is being tarnished by the actions and thoughtlessness of some Australians who fail to recognise that it is the incomes and taxes of Australian families that allow them the luxury to choose what jobs they will or will not take.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is a sad fact that many years ago a government would have been dismissed without pity for allowing unemployment to reach today's levels. Yet in the 1990s it would appear that the Australian electorate has grown immune, even numb, to the continuing human tragedy being inflicted on many Australian families by such high levels of unemployment. I trust that this parliament will acknowledge the concerns and comments of Mrs Mills and act to end the ridiculous situation she has drawn to our attention.

         —It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak tonight and congratulate a wonderful group of people and, in particular, the President of the Taiwan Friendship Association of Queensland Inc., Michelle Huang. As honourable members will know, we have recently celebrated Chinese New Year. In Queensland we had a number of celebrations. The Vietnamese had a celebration a couple of weekends ago. At the New Year weekend nobody had official celebrations; there were private celebrations with families and so on.

         To mark the occasion, the Taiwan Friendship Association of Queensland had a wonderful party and celebration at the Performing Arts Complex. It was very definitely a multicultural affair and showed to the rest of the Brisbane community the talents which that community has. We had the traditional dances: kung-fu, the lion dance and the dragon dance, and a delightful young lady performed the national dance. As well, two of the most interesting items were the Mami Choir and the youth choir. The Mami choir stems from traditional places in Taiwan. The women, usually the spouses of members of the friendship associations and business organisations, form a choir and perform. The Mami choir was delightful. Over 30 women participated in the choir and sang in harmony.

There was also a Chinese orchestra that was led by a doctor of music at QUT, and many other talented musicians. It is indicative of the kind of society and community we have that we can have a dynamic organisation such as the Taiwan Friendship Association, led by its very strong and energetic president, Michelle Huang, and her committee, bring to all of us in the city of Brisbane an awareness of what the Chinese New Year is about, and allow us to participate in their community's celebrations.

         Indeed, multiculturalism is alive and well in Forde. The Rodelu Soccer Club is made up of people from the Spanish speaking part of the world. While basically Rodelu is about Uruguay, it hosted as part of its contribution over the last few weeks a football competition involving 16 soccer teams for the first Logan City peace cup. It was a very successful competition. It points the way to the kinds of organisations we can have and the kinds of things that can happen when multiculturalism is truly about sharing, bringing variety and operating in a way that enables us all to participate in sporting and social events and to build bridges.

         —I want to raise a matter that I raised in today's 90-second statements. I think I was wrong in my speech, so I am coming in to correct it. I said in my speech that the city of Canning, under the local capital works program, got $3 1/2 million. I was wrong; it was actually $7 million. I sincerely ask for the forgiveness of the House. I was trying to point out that the local capital works program in my electorate—the largest municipality in the state and the second fastest growing in the country, after the Albert Shire in the electorate of the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford)—received absolutely zilch from the local capital works program announced in the 1992 federal budget by the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), under a $350 million local capital works program.

         At the time it was alleged that this program was designed to allow councils in areas experiencing high and protracted levels of unemployment to undertake capital works projects which they may have seen the need for but which they did not have the financial capacity to see through. When the then minister, the honourable member for Calare, (Mr Simmons), introduced that program he talked of its broad national coverage and how the formula for the allocation of funds was designed to identify and target council areas that had recently experienced higher than average rates of unemployment.

         My constituents in the city of Wanneroo, of which there are a large number, were absolutely astounded to find that they got nothing—not a cracker; in fact, they got zilch. There were, around the time, 9,000 unemployed within the boundaries of the city. They could not believe that this program, that was designed to alleviate unemployment in local government areas, had missed them out. They were particularly offended by the fact that other councils, not only in Western Australia but around the country, received large allocations of money and appeared from the statistics to be much less deserving cases than the city of Wanneroo.

         When we looked at the analysis of where the money went in Western Australia, it became clearer and clearer that the money had been targeted, through the formula that was used in this program, in areas that had—surprise, surprise—marginal Labor seats. One does not need to be Albert Einstein to have seen that. Swan, Brand and Perth, sitting Labor marginal seats, were allocated $3 million, $4 million and $3.9 million respectively. As I have said, one does not have to be a cynic to draw the conclusion that there was a targeting of marginal Labor seats. The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) at the time was a candidate for the seat of Cowan. It must have been that, in determining the formula that allowed this targeting to take place, they had already decided that the former member had lost the seat and therefore they would not waste any further money on it. As it turned out, her seat did not get any money within the city of Wanneroo.

         I represent an area that is experiencing one of the fastest residential growth rates in the country. It is absolutely huge. We have suburbs where eight families are moving in a week. The growth is so phenomenal that the infrastructure demand placed on municipalities like the City of Wanneroo is absolutely diabolical. As I said, at the time we just could not understand how a scheme that purported to allow for the alleviation of unemployment in local government areas could have possibly missed the city of Wanneroo. Next door, the city of Stirling got $7 million. The city of Canning, which had significantly fewer unemployed than the city of Wanneroo, also got $7 million. The only possible conclusion that one could have drawn from that program is that, like the sports rorts affair, the local capital works program of the 1992 federal budget was designed and targeted to help the re-election chances of sitting marginal Labor members.

         I would like to pay tribute, as many others have done, to those brave men and women who took part in the firefighting effort. It is an extremely hazardous task for both professionals and volunteers. Unfortunately, some lost their lives. Volunteer firefighters carry out this work as an act of community service, like surf-lifesavers. Professional firefighters do it as a vocation. Last week two professional firemen died in the course of their duties fighting a fire on the Gold Coast: Noel Watson, 33 years old, lived in Springbrook in my electorate, and Herbert Fennell, 46 years old, lived in Coombabah in a neighbouring electorate. I would like to place on record here the thanks of the community, and recognise that they gave their lives in service to the community. I extend my deepest sympathy to their wives and families.

         Bushfires occur regularly in Australia, particularly in summer. Sometimes, however, circumstances coincide which heighten the danger, often with horrific consequences such as we saw in the Blue Mountains in the 1960s and with Ash Wednesday in Victoria in 1983.

         Questions have been asked recently about the adequacy of firefighting methodology and technology. I certainly do not profess to be an expert, but my attention was recently drawn to the practice, particularly in North America, of aerial fire bombing. This method is well proven there. Apparently, most Australian control agencies in the past have opposed the introduction of aerial fire bombing using water scooping amphibian aircraft. The reasons given include the potential it has to damage property or cause injuries to people. These objections are, however, quite easily answered. In a recent article in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Flying
         </emphasis>
         magazine, Paul Phelan suggested that the real answer may lie in the threat that this method has to the vested interests in fire control agencies where there is apparently only a limited degree of coordination across borders. As the article says:

        Fire doesn't stop when it reaches the boundaries of shires, national parks, forestry reserves, cities or states. Commonsense demands that the fire-prone areas of south eastern Australia eventually be placed under a leading-edge integrated cross-border fire management organisation.

       <para>
        I tend to agree. Helicopters which were used in the recent New South Wales fires have only a very limited capacity—between one and 10 per cent of the output of, for example, a Canadair CL215 or the later version CL415. The large payload of this aircraft allows a quick and substantial reaction in remote places to stop a small fire from becoming a large uncontrollable one.

         The cost of the New South Wales bushfires has been estimated to be as much as $1.6 billion. These aircraft cost only $17 million each. A fleet could be acquired by the Department of Defence for one tenth of the cost of the New South Wales fires. I need to point out that these aircraft are in effect multipurpose aircraft. They can carry freight and passengers during non-fire risk times.

         I hope that a serious evaluation will be carried out into the potential this technology has to save properties and forests as well as human and animal life. I intend to ask the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to carry out such an evaluation. The high cost of acquiring these aircraft obviously means it is not a proposition for a regional authority or indeed for private enterprise. It therefore, once again, requires a national solution and I believe that the Department of Defence is ideally situated to give consideration to taking on that particular responsibility.

         I know there is an inquiry going on at the moment in New South Wales as to the cause of the fires. I do not, as I say, pretend to be an expert, nor do I want in any way to pre-empt the findings of that inquiry. I do think that it is high time that very serious consideration was given to a national response to the problem which obviously occurs from time to time. Hopefully the lessons that are learned from the New South Wales fires can lead to the introduction of the latest technology that is available in other parts of the world to make sure that the problem does not happen again.

Well, among you, aren't there veterans who have fought in Vietnam for the ideal of Freedom against Communism? Aren't there among you people who have worked for charitable institutions since 1975 in helping the Vietnamese refugees? Among you, aren't there Members of Parliaments who have voiced their opinion requesting the Australian Government and the Federal Parliament to adopt an appropriate attitude vis-a-vis the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, namely to express the Australian concern of the lack of human rights and democracy in Vietnam to Vietnamese Prime Minister, Mr Vo Van Kiet, during his visit to Australia in 1993 looking for foreign aids.

        May I also seize this opportunity to talk to you briefly about our faith. In the Western part of South Vietnam there is a denomination called the Hoa Hao Buddhism. It is based on World Buddhism but modified to suit the Vietnamese population. It made its appearance in 1939 with the teaching of Master Huynh Phu So. Master Huynh was born in the village of Hoa Hao and it's also in his native village that Master Huynh started preaching: our denomination has been since known as the Hoa Hao Buddhism.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        When South Vietnam fell into communist hands, Hoa Hao Buddhism became the target of revenge for the communists, a ruthless and dreadful revenge, and yet not known to the world at large. Why such a revenge? Because from 1945 to 1975 Hoa Hao believers had always been staunchly against the atheist aspect of communism, and therefore many of them had died fighting for religious freedom. When the communists took over South Vietnam in 1975, they started their policy of terrorization of our believers and killing numerous Hoa Hao officials. Centres of worship were confiscated to raise cows and pigs. Hospitals and schools, including the Hoa Hao University, were plundered. Since 1975, Hoa Hao believers have not been allowed to celebrate their religious anniversaries, nor to practise their worship or read their books of prayers. In brief, under the communist regime, four million Hoa Hao believers have to remain silent, inactive with regards to their religious faith. If you had the opportunity to visit Vietnam and to go to the Western region of South Vietnam you would not see any religious activities or manifestations. According to a buddhist belief `You reap what you sow'. We believe that the Vietnamese communists will be destroyed by their own evil doing. Look at the collapse of world communism in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc. Can Vietnamese communism be an exception to the rule?
       </para>
       <para>
        Such a poignant address to those present I think deserves our attention because there are so many of the Hoa Hao Buddhist faith in Vietnam now who are suffering persecution, unable to practise the teachings of Master Huynh and their own faith. For a country like ours, which, of course, expounds religious freedom, the opportunity to worship in one's own faith, surely we can make our voice known plain to the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to let it know we will not tolerate the persecution of Hoa Hao Buddhists.

        It is not possible to provide details of advertising revenue in each State. This information is Commercial-in-Confidence as the small number of advertisements which appear in each State version of Tax Pack would enable the individual cost of advertisements to be derived.

        It is normal commercial practice to retain the option of offering discount rates for advertising space in publications, and elsewhere, in order to maximise revenue.

        (5) Australia Post did not pay to have its logo appear on the inside front cover of Tax Pack. The advertisement in which the logo appeared was placed by the ATO to promote the arrangement with Australia Post to provide bill paying services to taxpayers. The advertisement including the Australia Post logo is consistent with other pamphlets and material promoting the bill paying service.

        The workload implications of the question are significant. My portfolio has in excess of 3,200 current employees and the list of former employees would be extensive. The details sought by the honourable member require data matching between personnel systems and creditors registers. As there is no electronic facility available for that task the work entailed would be almost entirely manual. I am therefore not prepared to direct that this work be undertaken.
