                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">12:04</span>):  As senators are aware, the Australian parliamentary computing network has recently been the subject of a security incident. As soon as the incident was identified, the Department of Parliamentary Services worked with the Australian Signals Directorate and its Cyber Security Centre to investigate and remediate the situation. As a consequence of this, the decision was taken last week to implement a number of measures to protect both the network and its users. One specific measure was to reset all network, user, administrator and system level passwords. The reset occurred between the hours of 3 am and 6.30 am last Friday, 8 February. During this time, a range of other measures were also undertaken. I can assure the Senate that this action was carried out as a standard security incident response procedure and precautionary measure to protect user access and information. A conscious decision was made to not advise users in advance, as any communication may have flagged remediation activities to the offender and limited remediation effectiveness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of APH users attended work on the morning of 8 February and, after logging on, were prompted to change their password. This then enabled users to resume work. The Department of Parliamentary Services ensured that additional resources were available on the 2020 service desk during Friday and the weekend, and leading up to this sitting period to manage the higher volume of calls generated by the password reset. An email was sent to all network users at approximately 9.30 am on Friday advising of the password reset and why it was necessary for it to occur, understanding that users who had not performed the reset would not receive this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For several years, the Australian Signals Directorate and its Cyber Security Centre have been working with DPS to improve security of the network. DPS has made substantial strides in strengthening cyberdefences, which have been effective in limiting the impact of this incident. While any intrusion to the network is extremely unfortunate, it is important to understand that the methods used by malicious actors are constantly evolving and no network, including the parliamentary computing network, is considered 100 per cent secure. If there is an incident, best practice is possessing the capability to detect it and then remediate it quickly. The relevant agencies have assured the Speaker and me that DPS acted decisively and fully cooperated with their advice, and that the handling of this incident represented best practice. The cooperation continues as DPS works with the experts of ASD to secure the system and protect its users. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, I would also like to specifically acknowledge the assistance and expertise of staff from the ASD's Cyber Security Centre, who have worked tirelessly alongside DPS to address and mitigate the impact of this incident. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not in a position to provide any information regarding attribution of responsibility for this intrusion. It is also likely to be some time before the investigation into this incident is concluded. I will provide further relevant updates to senators as is appropriate. </span>

                  </a>  I bring this motion forward in the Senate today because we have seen unprecedented environmental collapse in the Murray-Darling Basin over the summer and unprecedented fish kills in the lower Darling. We've seen the River Murray and the Darling absolutely crippled by mismanagement, water theft and a failure to implement the objectives of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which was meant to save our river system and give it a fighting chance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in the Murray-Darling we have our nation's largest river system—a river system that waters our nation's food bowl. It is a symbol of Australia and how we protect our environment and how we look after the sustainability of our environment. More than 2.6 million Australians call the Murray-Darling Basin home. The basin is the food bowl of our nation. The agriculture industry within the basin is worth $24 billion annually. It is responsible for producing around one-third of our nation's food. The basin is, of course, also rich in culture. It has been home to more than 40 Aboriginal nations for thousands and thousands of years. Tourism is worth $8 billion a year to basin communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 30,000 wetlands across the basin, and 16 are internationally significant. Over three million people have access to fresh, clean drinking water from the basin. The basin is unique, providing diverse habitats for 120 waterbird species and 46 native fish species. The fishing industry in the basin employs 10,000 people. The Murray-Darling Basin is the largest and most complex river system in Australia. It runs, of course, from Queensland, through New South Wales and even the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria, and into my home state in South Australia, spanning 77,000 kilometres of rivers. It covers about 14 per cent of Australia's landmass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen this summer is the environment in collapse—a river system on the brink of death. We've seen millions of fish floating on the top of the river because there is not enough water for the system to survive. When I visited Menindee in the days following the second mass fish kill, I was struck by the heartbreak of the locals—farmers in the area who'd been there for generations. One particular man, who was in his late 70s, said to me as he picked up a big, dead Murray cod that this was one of the ones that had got away when he, as a kid, had been fishing on the banks of the Darling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For generations and for years we have known that the water wars that govern the Murray-Darling Basin have left our river high and dry. We know that there is too much water being taken out of the system to give the environment the chance for resilience and to survive in the drier periods. We know, after years and years of debate on managing the Murray-Darling Basin, that we had to have a set of rules that were fair so that, whatever part of the basin you live in, you would know that the river would be given the chance to survive and be there for future generations. In order to do that, we knew that we had to return more water to the system. That's what the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was meant to do—return water to the river to give it a chance to survive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Six years after the Murray Darling Basin Plan had been implemented, with $13 billion on the table, what we see is a river system in collapse—$13 billion of Australian taxpayers' money; six years of mismanagement, water theft and corruption. We've brought forward this motion today because the government doesn't want to talk about this. The water minister, David Littleproud, hasn't even bothered to go to Menindee and see the catastrophe for himself. We know that this government continues to do the bidding of big corporate irrigators, at the expense of the environment and river communities and those smaller farmers that need the river to survive. One of the elements of this motion is to call for the immediate repeal of the cap on water buybacks, because with $13 billion on the table we should be having water returned to the river, but instead we have a river system that is being sucked dry. Meanwhile, big corporate irrigators are having their pockets lined with Australian taxpayers' money. The government and the National Party are looking after their big corporate mates, while everybody else is expected to suffer in silence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of South Australia, people are pretty angry at what is going on. They're pretty angry that, despite what was meant to be put in place to manage the Murray-Darling Basin, to give the river a fighting chance, we see millions of fish dead, a river system in collapse. Rather than putting more water into the river, lifting that ban on buybacks, getting water into the system, tackling the overallocation of water licences and regulating and properly accounting for the vast amounts of water that are being harvested across flood plains, this government says, 'Don't blame us; just pray for rain.' That's the Prime Minister's answer to the crisis in the Murray-Darling Basin right now: 'Don't blame the National Party. Don't blame Barnaby Joyce. Blame God. Pray for rain, and all will be okay.' There is a total lack of leadership coming from Prime Minister Scott Morrison right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This river system is our nation's lifeblood. It waters our nation's food bowl. We need this river if we are to survive as a country that prides itself on clean produce and sustainable agriculture. Those millions of fish floating on the top of the Darling over summer struck a chord with Australians right across the country. Everybody knows there is something wrong with this system. Everybody knows that too much water is being taken out of the river, and it's time we put some back. Australians aren't silly. They know who's been sucking our river dry; it's the greedy big corporate irrigators who care more about their profits than they do about the health of the river and keeping the river system there for future generations. Those big corporate foreign cotton farms don't care if the river runs dry. In fact, they are spending millions of taxpayers' dollars harvesting overland flows and floodwaters so that the water doesn't get into the river system, so they can keep it for watering their cotton crops. There is something rotten with the management of the Murray-Darling Basin, and every Australian who's been watching what's happened this summer knows it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission three weeks ago handed down a report into the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The Productivity Commission said very clearly that the objectives of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, to restore environmental flows, had been forgotten. Those objectives are now divorced from the way the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is being implemented. This parliament has approved $13 billion of taxpayers' money that was meant to be spent saving the river system, and we have a river in crisis and fish dead in the lower Darling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Australian royal commission report that was handed down two weeks ago was very clear in its condemnation of the management and implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan as well. In fact, it confirmed many of the things that the government's own Productivity Commission report had said. Clearly, these two reports nail what is going on: maladministration, greed and unlawful activity. What we've seen is a Basin Plan that has become corrupted because of political and corporate interference. What we've seen is the management of the Murray-Darling Basin become more about lining the pockets of big corporate irrigators, the mates of the former water minister Barnaby Joyce, rather than securing the water the river needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Mr Joyce was the water minister, he got caught bragging about how much water he'd taken off the environment to give to his mates in the corporate irrigating industry. What have we got now? A dead river, dead fish, an environment in collapse. If there is anyone responsible for this environmental disaster this summer, it's former water minister Barnaby Joyce. This is on his head. It's up to this government to do something about it. If they won't, this parliament should. One of the urgent things that needs to be done is water needs to be secured for the river. That doesn't mean praying for rain. That means lifting the ban on the buybacks, purchasing water and getting it into the system. We've had the Prime Minister and the current water minister say that there's nothing that can be done. They're in charge of this system. This has happened on their watch. They say it's just drought. Well, no, it's not. It's corporate cotton, it's corruption and it's climate change. While this government has its head buried in the sand on all three of those issues, it's never going to come up with a plan to save the river.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back home in South Australia, we have the state Liberal government doing whatever they can to cover up the incompetence and corruption that have been going on in Canberra and interstate—so much so that the South Australian water minister was singled out in the South Australian royal commission report because of his failure to stand up for our state. The commissioner, Bret Walker, is clearly not a man to mince his words. He called out the irresponsibility of the South Australian government and the minister, saying that he may have even breached the ministerial code of conduct because he sold South Australia out so badly at the last ministerial council meeting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think South Australians give two hoots about who fixes the river; they just want it fixed. They want the water returned to the system as we were promised. We know that that extra 450 gigalitres that South Australia was meant to get will never be delivered as long as this government is in charge. South Australians deserve better than this. The people of Menindee deserve better than this. The people living throughout the Murray-Darling Basin and those river communities all deserve better than this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not rocket science; the system has been over-allocated for decades. If we want to save the river, we have to give the environment back its fair share. It doesn't matter how much negotiation there is or how many tricks of accounting this government or the Murray-Darling Basin Authority want to dream up; Mother Nature is crying out for help. The Prime Minister says that what happened in Menindee is a disaster. Well, yes, it is—a man-made disaster on his government's watch, and it's time they did something about it. The things that can be done instantly are lifting the ban on buybacks and ensuring water is purchased for the environment and the river, including the extra 450 gigalitres that South Australia was promised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australians living at the bottom of the system know very, very well that, if we don't fix this river system now, it's never going to happen. The environment is crying out for intervention. Business as usual must change. There is a view that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is too big to fail—that we can't do anything about it because it's too big to fail. Well, it's not. It's failing now, right before our eyes, and we must intervene. It is our responsibility as parliamentarians in this place to look at what has happened, to listen to the scientists, to see the evidence before us and to act. The Prime Minister might want us to pray for rain. I want some water to be returned to the river, as do South Australians and river communities right throughout the basin. If we don't get the water returned to the river it will be too late. A million dead fish, $13 billion of taxpayers' money and some pretty greedy, happy corporate irrigators—clearly something is rotten and it needs cleaning up now. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that's the essential part of this particular motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was lucky enough to be born on the River Murray, at the great South Australian Murraylands town of Murray Bridge. Like just about all South Australians, I've been passionate about the health of this mighty river system all of my life. The Murray and the Darling systems are not only iconic parts of our Australian landscape and environment; they're the lifeblood of many Australian communities. We have a responsibility to manage the entire system in a way that ensures its health and its sustainability not just for a year or an electoral cycle or the time between one good season of good flows and the next. As federal parliamentarians, we have a responsibility to manage it in the best possible way to ensure its health and sustainability both now and for future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen what happens when the rains stop, and the worrying reports about further mismanagement of the basin. Acting Deputy President Gallacher, I'm sure you've seen this in recent weeks and months, as the report of the South Australian royal commission has shocked people in South Australia. We've seen the theft and corruption that has gone on and been exposed by the royal commission. We've seen a dry riverbed. We've seen dying crops. We've seen those most shocking scenes of Murray cod, golden perch and other native fish suffocating in their thousands and perhaps millions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A cap on water buybacks was never part of the original Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Of course, that plan was put through this parliament by Tony Burke, the then environment minister, who worked tirelessly for months and years with Prime Minister Julia Gillard to get that plan through this parliament. What the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission has made clear is that the cap on water buybacks should now be repealed. It was a feature of the original Murray-Darling, but, because of the incompetence and the misuse of the plan by the coalition government, we are now of the view that the only way to save the Murray-Darling Basin is to repeal that cap on buybacks. Repealing the cap on buybacks is also a recommendation of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, an independent expert group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has to be a mechanism for getting more water through the system to restore it to good health. The Murray-Darling Basin is under pressure from drought and mismanagement by this coalition government. The cap on buybacks reduces the incentive for governments to buy back water for the environment and to develop effective supply projects. Removing the cap removes any legislative barrier to buybacks over 1,500 gigalitres being one of those options. It also means that, if the 650 gigalitres of supply measures—projects that are still under development in some cases—do not deliver, buyback becomes an option into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament must put the sustainability of the Murray-Darling Basin ahead of partisan politics. We must not continue to have the sort of situation we had when Barnaby Joyce was responsible—or perhaps irresponsible—for this portfolio. His South Australian coalition colleagues were more interested in pandering to his personal political interests than they were in standing up for the health of the River Murray in their home state. I can see three of them sitting over there on the other side. Everybody else was calling for action—federal Labor MPs and senators, state Labor MPs and a coalition of local councils along the full length of the River Murray. But where were the government MPs and senators? They were nowhere to be seen. They had trust in New South Wales to deliver on this. Of course, as the royal commission has very clearly identified, that trust was completely misplaced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again we've seen undeniable evidence that things are not right with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. But what do we get from those opposite? Not much more than cop-outs. 'We can't make it rain,' they would say. Well, none of us can make it rain, but we can work together to ensure that the incredibly precious and critical resource that we have in the Murray-Darling Basin is managed in a way that anticipates drought. We're all aware of the cycle of drought and flooding rains. That's probably never been more evident than this year, with those floods in Townsville. Those of us who don't have our heads in the sand are also aware that this cycle changes over time. The millennium drought no doubt played a part in increasing the will within politics to deliver the historic agreement reached under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, we have again seen drought that has had a terrible impact not only on the river system but on many Australian communities. In my home state of South Australia, communities along the river have been ahead of the curve, introducing super-efficient, modern infrastructure and strategies. South Australian irrigators have proven that smart investment and smart management can allow them to make the most of the water that is available to them. We've done it in tough times, but we've made an effort. We need all stakeholders in the health and sustainability of the Murray-Darling Basin to make that effort. I call upon those opposite, in particular my fellow South Australian senators, to work constructively and put the river before politics.</span>

                  </a>  I would draw to the attention of the chamber that Clare does take a certain amount of its water supply from the Murray-Darling Basin. Maybe Senator Farrell lives in the poor part of Clare that hasn't got access to water from the Murray-Darling, and I'm sure his grapes are absolutely lovely because they're all rain irrigated. But, nonetheless, let's get back to the story that we're trying to tell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the risk of giving you a history lesson about the development of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, can I pay tribute to those opposite for the extraordinarily bipartisan way the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was developed? When it was originally established back many, many years ago, there were many people who played a significant part in the development of this plan, and I'll acknowledge many of your counterparts, including previous Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Certainly, Tony Burke has had a very big involvement, as has the previous Prime Minister from our side of politics, Malcolm Turnbull. Senator Birmingham was instrumental in the development and putting together of the plan at the time. We have all had an investment in this plan, so let's go back to that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think the Australian public has any idea—and certainly, if you listen to her, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, hasn't any idea—about the level of negotiation that was required to enable this plan to be born in the first place. Do many people understand that there were 11 houses of parliament that this legislation had to get through? Eleven houses of parliament had to agree for this plan to be put together. So, what I would say is: let's get back to the table and let's start talking about this in a bipartisan way—certainly, for any plan that is going to take as long as this plan will to implement. We had 12 years to implement this plan. We're halfway through that 12 years. I think that we need to constantly be going back to the plan, looking at ways it can be achieved and making sure that it's achieving its outcomes. But this is throwing in a political time bomb three months out from an election and trying to blow the thing up again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We went through all of this debate 12 months ago when we had the issue about whether we wanted to support the SDL adjustment or whether we were going to support the northern basin review. So we threw a bomb into this place, creating great uncertainty amongst all of our communities out there in the Murray-Darling Basin. It created great uncertainty, because what we need to realise—and you can stand on your high horse and you can bleat for as long as you like—is that the cold, hard reality is that we are not going to have this plan delivered in full for the benefit of all communities, the river, the river system, the environment, and all Australians unless everybody continues to stay at the table. Constantly poking the bear has the likelihood that, if you poke the bear one too many times, one of our constituencies that have to stay at the table to get this plan delivered will walk away and we will blow the whole plan up. Be it on your head. If you're going to be smart here, you're going to cause one of the parties to walk away from this table that they've sat around. We've negotiated. There have been huge differences of opinion as we've sat around the MinCo table.</span>

                  </a>  Well, that's your opinion. I've got to tell you that South Australia currently has 100 per cent of its water allocation—I will say that again: 100 per cent of its water allocation—because of the good management of South Australia over the last 40 or 50 years and the good negotiations of South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, let's get back to our history lesson. I want to tell you about my community. My community was the second established irrigation community in the Murray-Darling Basin, after Mildura. My community is Renmark. It was established by the Chaffey brothers. My grandfather was actually the chair of the Renmark Irrigation Trust. Proudly, to this day, it still stands as the only irrigation trust in Australia that has its very own act of parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am an irrigator, and I am very, very proud of my community. I'm proud of a hundred years of responsible water management. I am proud of the fact that we were innovators; we were leaders in our community. We went to pressurised, piped irrigation systems. We have been the most efficient and effective water users in the country since irrigation first started in this country and first started in the Murray-Darling Basin. So I stand here as a proud, proud member of my community—a proud member of a community that has never done anything that would have a consequential detrimental impact on the river system. So my story is one of great pride, and it's greatly disappointing, and I should imagine that every single member of my community and Mr Morrison<span class="HPS-GeneralBold">:</span>  any others who live along the Murray-Darling Basin would be devastated, to see the rubbish that gets said in this place about the community and how they've been handling the river.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd just like to comment on a couple of the things that Senator Hanson-Young put forward. She said that the river system is in collapse. Well, certainly, the northern part of the system is suffering an extreme amount of hardship and stress because of the fact that we are in one of the worst droughts that anyone can remember. We remember, in the southern connected basin, the millennium drought and the consequences that that had on us and our irrigation communities, on the health of the river and on the people who rely on the river, whether it be for drinking water, for public amenity or for growing the food that every single one of us in here is quite happy to put on the table for our families and our children to eat for dinner tonight. Let's not forget where that food comes from. So as to suggesting that the river system is 'in collapse': certainly I will accept the fact that the northern system is under a lot of stress. But in South Australia, with 100 per cent of our water allocation, the southern part of the system is actually in reasonably good health at the moment, and part of that can be attributed to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan working. We have 2,100 gigalitres of water that has been returned to the environment. That's flowing down the river as we speak. We've still got some more to go, and we are absolutely committed to getting to the 3,200 gigalitres of water that we said would be returned to the basin under this plan. But in 2024, we have the opportunity to assess where we have actually got to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In another comment that Senator Hanson-Young made—and I'm not quite sure she actually realised the ridiculousness of her comment—she referred to the Murray-Darling Basin as the food bowl of the country. Well, yes, Senator Hanson-Young—it is the food bowl of the country. But it won't be if you take more water away from irrigators and completely decimate the communities. Just a little lesson in economics, Senator Hanson-Young: if you take so much out of a community that it can no longer exist as a community, the entire irrigation district collapses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we sought to do with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is to make sure that we took a responsible approach to making sure that we delivered the outcomes that addressed the concerns and the needs of the entire basin and all of its stakeholders. We're not just going to return the river to pristine environmental condition and completely trash the food bowl of the country and the people who grow the food that will sit on your table for dinner tonight. We're not going to trash river communities so they no longer exist. We're going to work systematically, sensibly and thoroughly through a 12-year process to deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Others may want to prosecute whether there's enough water or there isn't enough water. I'd like to think that the Labor Party will remain committed to the bipartisan position that they came to this place with in the first place, and that is that we are going to deliver this plan in full. We accept 3,200 gigalitres is the amount of water that we want to deliver by 2024, when we will reassess the success of the plan. So I'm hoping that they haven't moved away from that—that this particular publicity stunt for political purposes is only about the 1,500 gigalitres, which I'll get to in a minute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other comments that we heard coming from the other end of the chamber were about large corporate irrigators sucking the river dry. Certainly there are corporate irrigators along the river system. But what about the tens of thousands of mum-and-dad irrigators, the tens of thousands of people who live in communities just like mine, who might have 20 hectares or 30 hectares? In my case, I had only 11 hectares. These are small irrigators. They are integral parts of the fabric of the community in which they live. They are responsible water users. They have bought their entitlements completely legally. They have participated in the process of trying to find water savings to put back for environmental use.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our river communities have been through a really tough time, but they're still standing. They're resilient. They've done the hard yards. So it's really disappointing that we should even be standing in this place today. The question has to be: why now? We're halfway through a process. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do a great environmental, social and economic readjustment in a system. Why are we talking about it today, but halfway through?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our international reputation in terms of water management is second to none anywhere around the world. But, standing in this chamber, you'd be excused for thinking that we were anything other than the most incompetent water managers in the world. What I would say to you is that we need to allow the process to take its course. This is a really complex plan. I'm not making any qualms about that whatsoever. We had the initial plan at 2,750 gigalitres. We then dealt with the 650 gigalitres of the sustainable diversion limits, which we put through the parliament with the support of the opposition last year. We are locked into providing the extra 450 gigalitres of up water to supplement the amount of water that's returned to the environment to 3,200 gigalitres. We put in the Northern Basin Review so we can make sure the northern basin considerations are taken as an iterative process as the plan goes forward. It is a very complex plan. If it was easy, it would have been done an awfully long time ago. It's not easy. It is really, really tough balancing the triple bottom line needs of the environment, the social impacts on communities and the economic driver that the Murray-Darling Basin is for the Australian economy. This is an absolutely fundamental piece of public policy that has been supported by those opposite up until now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving on to the 1,500 gigalitre cap to which this particular motion refers, can I say it is extraordinarily lazy or it's extraordinarily political that we should be standing here today dealing with the 1,500 gigalitre cap. Can I just put on the record that, as we stand here today, 270 billion litres of water is still available through the cap buyback. We haven't even reached the cap of 1,500 gigalitres. So why are we standing in this chamber, three months out from an election, having a debate about the cap? If you had come in here and tried to debate some other thing, you might have had some more credibility. But to be debating the cap when you haven't even reached the cap is absolutely hypocritical. You cannot defend what you're doing in any other way than saying that you're doing this for purely political purposes, because you want to be re-elected come the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I put it on the table: it is lazy politics and it is not good policy. It might be cheaper and it might be easier to buy back water, but that is not the best thing for our river communities. It is not the best thing for our economies that live and grow the food in the Murray-Darling Basin. So it is purely lazy and cheap politics, because it does not take into consideration the communities that depend on the river and the irrigation from the river. And it will have a massively, massively devastating effect for two reasons. Firstly, it will have a devastating effect because, of course, there is more water that has to come out of these communities. But it will also have a devastating effect because you will put these communities back into uncertainty. How much more uncertainty do you want these communities to have to suffer? We have been through 10 years of uncertainty in the Murray-Darling Basin, not knowing from one year to the next how much water we're going to have and whether water has to be taken away. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We gave some certainty back to our River Murray irrigators when we put in a cap of 1,500 gigalitres. We never moved away from the target of 3,200. We stand here rock solid, with everybody in this chamber, that we will deliver the Murray Darling Basin Plan in full. We don't move away from that. All we are saying is, 'Leave our irrigators with the certainty of knowing that they are not going to have buybacks come in and take their water.' Let me make it very clear: a lot of the buybacks that initially happened were not from willing sellers. An awful lot of these people were under stress from banks because they'd just come out of the millennium drought, and they sold their water under hugely stressful conditions. So don't be conned into thinking that there is a whole heap of people out there who want to sell their water to you—there aren't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that this morning, Tony Burke, the shadow minister for water, was talking on ABC Radio South Australia and he made the comment, 'Buybacks at the moment haven't reached the cap.' So Tony Burke, by his own admission, accepts the fact this is not necessary at this time. He went on to say: 'If we get to 2024 and we haven't reached our targets, well, let's have a look at the mechanisms which we might have to use to be able to get that water.' By his own admission he says that this is not something that is needed now, so why are you bringing this into the chamber now? It can only be for politics. You need to justify that to your electorates. And another thing: David Bevan, the ABC journalist who was interviewing Tony Burke, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There will be regional communities right across the Murray-Darling Basin who would be very worried about that, because they see buybacks as killing communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Guess what Tony Burke said? 'That's right.' Is that okay?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that I'd love somebody to perhaps ask Tony Burke—and maybe some of you in your contribution to this debate this afternoon could explain this to me—is where these buybacks are going to come from. Are they going to come out of my community in Renmark? Are you going to turn up in Renmark and tell people that you're going to take more water out of their community? I have to tell you right now that Renmark has just recovered from the massive number of buybacks that have come out of the community. They're just back on their feet and the economy is starting to move after a time when every second shop in the main street of Renmark was shut because of the uncertainty and the Swiss-cheese effect of ripping water entitlements out in the middle of a community. The cost of the delivery of our irrigation water went through the roof, because there were half the number of irrigators irrigating off the same system. You don't understand until you're part of these communities how it rips the very guts out of the communities when you come in and randomly take from here and there.</span>

They have had enough, and you have to stop. The removal of the cap of 1,500 gigalitres is completely unnecessary because we haven't reached the cap yet. It is totally politically motivated—unless somebody can explain to me otherwise. It is a totally defeatist attitude to think that, six years into a plan, we aren't clever enough and innovative enough to be able to achieve this water recovery. In Senator Farrell's very own words, if we continue with 'smart investment' and 'smart management', we can reach the goals and water targets within this plan without destroying my community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I rise in support of this motion. Since the last sitting I have travelled the Murray-Darling extensively, right down to Murray Bridge. I've been to Wentworth, where the Murray intersects with the Darling. I've driven up the Lower Darling twice. I've been to Menindee twice, before the highly publicised fish kill. I've been across to Mudgee, up to Dubbo, through Brewarrina, Dalby, Goondiwindi and even to Tilpa, about 200 kilometres north of nowhere in New South Wales, where the river was as dry as a bone. We've seen the fish kills; I don't think we need to talk much more about them. I've seen bone-dry rivers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I left Dubbo two Mondays ago to drive north up into the northern basin, there was 1,665 megalitres of flow at Dubbo. A three-hour drive north on the same river, the flows were down to zero. The only thing in between was irrigators taking water for their crop. People say they have an entitlement, but what about the people downstream: the people at Brewarrina, who are desperately worried that they won't have any water; the people at Bourke, who are on the verge of not having any drinking water; the people at Walgett, not on the same river system but in northern New South Wales, who have no drinking water from the river because of the state it is in?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the last time I was here, we've also seen the Productivity Commission hand down a review on the state of the Murray-Darling. That review raises some very serious concerns about the risks associated with the 605-gigalitre SDLs and in relation to the 450-gigalitre efficiency measures. We need to have regard to what the Productivity Commission has said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also had a royal commission report handed down. That report was quite scathing. That report suggested in no uncertain terms that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is based on legally and scientifically flawed data. I think all of us who have regard for the rule of law in this place, and indeed for science, need to pay heed to what the royal commissioner has said. The royal commissioner also raised allegations of maladministration and political interference. Those are not my words; they are the words of the royal commissioner. And yet the response to the royal commission was disappointing at best. In fact, it was quite disrespectful in some instances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've just been looking at the resume of Mr Walker, an eminent QC. He was appointed for three years as the inaugural Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, a very important role in the context of national security. He ran a special commission into the Sydney Ferries Corporation. He was counsel conducting inquiries into the Casino Control Act in 1992. He conducted the Special Commission of Inquiry into Campbelltown and Camden Hospitals. His resume is quite deep with very important roles, and he is an eminent QC; a man of intellect. And yet some of the responses we saw to the royal commission report were very disrespectful—coming from government ministers. I understand that Mr Niall Blair, the water minister in New South Wales, and Mr Littleproud, the federal minister, both represent communities that have irrigators in them. Mr Littleproud, of course, represents the townships of St George, Dirranbandi, Dalby and Goondiwindi, all cotton-growing and irrigation areas. I would imagine that, if I were ever in the position that he is in, where as a minister he represents the Federation, I would be much more measured in my response to the royal commission and much more respectful. Even in South Australia we've had very soft responses from the Premier there, Steven Marshall. These sorts of responses are quite disrespectful of a royal commissioner, because people just don't want to hear what he has to say. Has anyone said the same sorts of things about Commissioner Hayne? People might have argued the toss, and are arguing the toss, about some of the recommendations that he's made, but they're not playing the man; they're playing the ball. That's the appropriate way in which we should be approaching the report of the royal commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson-Young stood up and criticised the irrigators, and the corporate irrigators in particular. I'm not going to do that, because they're not actually the problem. They are a symptom of the problem. They take water they are legally entitled to take because the system allows them to do that. I think we need to be careful about directing blame unnecessarily at irrigators. I might add—and we know this from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> show 'Pumped'—that there were some irrigators who were breaking the law. That is totally unacceptable, and some of them are actually before the courts right at this very moment. That's where they should be, answering charges under judicial processes, so there's fairness. We need to deal very swiftly with people who are taking water unlawfully. The situation we have at the moment is not about breaking laws; it's about broken laws. It's about us letting them do what they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have foreshadowed that tomorrow I will introduce a bill into this parliament to ban the exporting of cotton. I have done so after my trip up into the north, seeing the expanding nature of that industry. Once again, they're not doing anything unlawful; they're doing what they are allowed to do. I've looked at this and said, 'Okay, if we can't solve this problem in a sensible and measured way then we need to look at perhaps more extreme approaches.' If we can't sit around and say, 'Let's deal with the recommendations of the royal commission in a sensible way,' then we might have to do something else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, cotton is a crop that is grown and then merely exported. It is a water-intensive crop that is grown and exported. It is the equivalent of exporting water. That's a silly thing to do in a country that is actually the driest inhabited continent on the planet. It does not make sense. So I've put up what people might call an unpalatable bill, but it is sitting there hoping that we find a better solution, hoping we find a solution that balances out the needs of all the people across the river. We need to look at the river from a needs based perspective and we need to prioritise some of those needs. I have given the example before about what's happening in Dubbo, where all of the water flowing down a river is going to irrigators. I don't mind water going to irrigators, but all of it? And in circumstances where people are running out of river water to drink? We need to look at this properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray-Darling Basin Plan, born of unlawful and unscientific methods—according to the royal commissioner, for whom I have great respect—deals with the allocations of water, the total amount of water we can safely take from the river. The royal commissioner comes to the conclusion that it shouldn't be 3,200 gigalitres that we need to return; it should probably be a number starting with '4'. We need look at that again. An allegation has been made by a royal commissioner. We need to tackle that allegation. I would like to have both the state jurisdictions and the federal jurisdiction look at what is written and deal with it. If not, there's an awful bill that I have put up, which only requires passing by this parliament to be enacted into law. It is the total domain of the federation to deal with matters such as export. So we need to be looking at allocations. We need to be looking at the SDL projects, because we know from the Productivity Commission report that there is risk associated with the delivery of that 605 gigalitres. We need to look at the 450 efficiency measures. We know there is risk, and, where there is risk, we must manage it properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In February last year, we voted on a northern basin review. This chamber rejected the proposal to return 70 gigalitres of water from the river back to irrigators in the northern basin. Unfortunately, when it was brought back in May, it passed. So we allowed 70 gigalitres to be returned to irrigators, and just look at the situation we are in. It's not necessarily because of that legislation, but, looking at it beside the circumstances we find ourselves in now, I think that was a most unwise thing for the Senate to do. I said at the time that I was concerned about the size. I said at the time that the Senate was not well informed; we didn't have all of the data before us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look at the river system in terms of not just allocation but also what are the smart crops to grow. We need to look at it and ask: 'Is it right to grow cotton? Is it right to grow almonds? Is it right to grow permanent crops or seasonal crops? What is the right mix of those crops?' That's how we should be approaching this problem. Instead we have denial; we have conflict across this chamber and, indeed, across the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, there are too many vested interests in this whole process. On the first day I sat in this chamber, my first day as a senator, I lodged a motion for an order for the production of documents relating to the Murray-Darling. I have been fighting since I've been here for transparency. Indeed, the royal commissioner found that the whole Murray-Darling Basin Plan is being implemented under a veil of secrecy. The Murray-Darling river is not a weapons system; it's not an intelligence operation. We need to be completely transparent in how we are managing that river and how we are spending taxpayers' money, and that is not happening at this point in time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A claim has been made about political interference. That should alarm people. Indeed, I know Senator Hanson-Young is proposing a federal royal commission. We know that Bret Walker was fettered in his inquiry because the federal government would not cooperate with him, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority would not cooperate with him and other states would not cooperate with him. In a circumstance where questions have been raised as to governance, political interference and maladministration, it is appropriate that we look at things like royal commissions, because it doesn't matter what you do to fix the plan; if the governance structure is corrupted in some way, we just end up landing back in the same space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's stop rejecting ideas; let's sit around the table with cool, calm heads and sort out how to fix what is clearly broken. It doesn't help that Senator Ruston stands and says, 'This is all political'. No-one has controlled the timing of the deaths of murray cod at Menindee. To suggest that somehow this is motivated by an election is, in my view, disingenuous. We've got dry rivers. We've got people running out of—please don't smile, Senator Canavan! We've got people in Walgett without water. I had a briefing the other day from a scientist down from the Coorong, and we've got problems down there too. We need to look at solving the problem. We don't need people with vested interests—I understand people represent their electorates, but you have to be mindful of national interest. We need to fix this. This is about the national interest; it's not about the Nationals' interest. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  We have the balance wrong. It's very clear. The Murray-Darling Basin needs more water to ensure its survival. The intent of the Water Act—to share savings between irrigators and the Commonwealth on a fifty-fifty basis—should be returned to. Irrigators are the primary beneficiaries of a plan originally designed to increase flows to the environment to have a sustainable system. But the irrigators won't benefit for much longer if the river dries up. The Menindee Lakes fish kill will only be the start of much larger and regular catastrophic events. So we must reorientate the plan to fairly balance environmental sustainability of the system with economic concerns of individual irrigators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Management of the Murray-Darling Basin requires urgent reform. That reform must be pragmatic. We must improve the integrity of the plan carefully and methodically without putting the plan itself at risk. Reforms outlined by the Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission, delivered 29 January this year, include critically important recommendations to improve transparency by requiring real-time data sharing and publication on water extractions, and a call to abolish the water buyback cap of 1,500 gigalitres, which we're addressing today. It recommends to undertake further research into return flows, so that we know the effects of irrigation efficiency projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission also delivered its findings to the government, on 19 December last year, pointing out that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's twin roles as overseer of the plan and its regulator are conflicted and that the conflicts will intensify in the next five years. Structural separation of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority into a basin plan regulator and a Murray-Darling Basin agency is required to ensure effective implementation of the plan. That is per the Productivity Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am encouraged that the Labor Party, the Greens and others are moving to abolish the water buybacks cap following the recommendation of the South Australian royal commission. I drafted an amendment to the Water Act to double the cap, which I had planned to introduce this week. The system needs more water to survive, and water buybacks have proven to be the most successful mechanism to achieve that aim. There is overwhelming evidence that water buybacks are cheaper, more reliable and more effective than other measures of water recovery. It's important to note that the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder puts out a blind tender, and those who want to sell put an offer in—so Senator Ruston's analogy regarding Renmark and the irrigators there is not solid—yet, since 2013, water buybacks have stalled just below the 1,500 gigalitre cap imposed by the coalition government in 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call upon the government to adopt each and every recommendation proposed by the Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission, which includes abolishing the water buyback cap of 1,500 gigalitres, and to proceed with the structural separation of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority as proposed by the Productivity Commission. We must act now before it is too late, but we must act carefully and responsibly, putting the sustainability of the system above short-term political gains. I, for one, believe that is the priority.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="111206" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  I find it galling—in fact, the height of hypocrisy. There must be an election on for this debate about the Murray-Darling Basin to be so dominated by South Australians. In fact, the motion is moved by a South Australian. It seems that practically every South Australian in this chamber wants to have their two bob's worth, as if their voices matter more than anybody else's. In fact, I suspect they think that theirs are the only voices that matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, let's talk about South Australia in the context of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. First of all, Australian water licence holders have sold almost 1,500 gigalitres of water under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. You would think, from all the bleating that has been going on, that the bulk of that has come from South Australia. Not so. Thirty-two gigalitres out of almost 1,500 gigalitres have been bought back from South Australian irrigators. I heard, previously, Senator Ruston say what effect that had had on her town of Renmark. Most of those licences must have been bought back in her area, because the rest of South Australia's irrigators have not felt the pain. I can tell you where the pain has been felt; it has been felt all along the Victorian border, close to the Murray River, and all along the New South Wales rivers. Go to towns like Shepparton, Deniliquin, Griffith and many, many other small towns, where the loss of water and the loss of irrigated farming has had an absolutely devastating effect on those country areas. South Australia's price for participating in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is a pimple on a pumpkin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that South Australians seem to forget all the time is that the Lower Lakes are kept artificially fresh. They wouldn't be fresh in their natural state. They are kept fresh because there are barrages across the mouth of the Murray which prevent the Murray from behaving like an estuary—the only river in Australia that is prevented from behaving like an estuary. In an estuary, when the river flow is low, the sea comes in; when the river flow is high, fresh water goes out to sea. That's how the Lower Lakes would be kept wet, permanently wet, so they wouldn't get salt-encrusted shores as occurred in the drought. They would be kept wet. They wouldn't be kept artificially fresh under natural conditions but for those barrages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, of course, that fresh water evaporates in the Lower Lakes. Nine hundred gigalitres a year evaporates from the Lower Lakes, all of it fresh water. Vast quantities of it, naturally enough, are water that has flowed down the Murray, a little bit of it down the Darling River, and into the Lower Lakes, where it evaporates. If those lakes were not kept artificially fresh, that 900 gigalitres of water which evaporates from Lake Alexandrina—and a little from Lake Albert, of course—could easily be brackish water, a mixture of seawater and fresh water. A lot of that 900 gigalitres could be retained further up the system either for environmental benefits or for irrigation and agriculture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Lower Lakes are an artificial environment. When we talk about protecting the environment, we are not talking about the natural environment. It's an artificial, man-made environment, and the South Australians don't ever mention that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other man-made impact that is very, very significant in this debate—also in South Australia, naturally enough—is the state of the Coorong. Until a few months ago, when I tweeted that the Coorong was dying and got criticised by Senator Hanson-Young for that, I don't think she knew where the Coorong was. Since then she's gone to look at it, and finally she now agrees with me: the Coorong is dying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But why is it dying? I'll tell you why. It's because, again in South Australia, they have a thing called the south-east drainage project. The swamps and the various other sources of water which stop the land from being productive agricultural land have been channelled into drains. The water is sent down and, instead of draining into the Coorong, which is where it used to go before it was channelled, it now goes straight out to sea. All that fresh water which used to go into the Coorong is now going out to sea. As a result, the tail end of the Coorong—in fact, the bulk of the uphill section, I suppose, if you put it that way—is deprived of fresh water because the water that would, under the natural environment, flow into the Coorong is not going into the Coorong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another aspect that I find the South Australians completely hypocritical about is this fish kill in the Menindee Lakes. Why did the fish die in the Menindee Lakes? There are two factors. One is not enough water. The other one is the high temperatures. That's what does it. You get blue-green algae. You get other bugs growing in the water. The water's not flowing; there's not enough of it to maintain an oxygen supply, and it kills the fish. Why was there not enough water in the Menindee Lakes? Because it was sent down the river to South Australia. They let it out. They've done it twice in the last five years. Both times it's caused problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the Menindee Lakes are not some sort of sacred environmental thing either. They're man-made. Under the natural environment, they are called ephemeral. They dry out when water flow is low, and, when water flow is high, there's water in them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have some sympathy for the people who live around the Menindee Lakes. They like to go out and waterski and ride their boats, but you couldn't call that an environmental argument. In fact, the best person to emerge out of this issue on the Menindee Lakes is the Hon. Niall Blair MLC, the New South Wales Minister for Regional Water, who is now saying there will be no more releases of water from the Menindee Lakes to send down to South Australia. Guess what happens when it gets to South Australia. It ends up in Lake Alexandrina and evaporates. Nobody is any better off, and neither is the environment any better off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm appalled that the South Australian royal commission is being quoted. The South Australian royal commission—despite the fact that it was a New South Wales QC: he might as well have said, 'Give me all your propaganda, South Australia, and I'll put it into a report,' that's what it amounts to—was a fancy argument for saying, 'Send more water to South Australia.' Why? 'The environment.' What about the environment? 'Don't go there—just, "The environment". South Australia needs more water. The whole Murray-Darling is going to die unless South Australia gets more water.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One final aspect that I want to bring into this discussion about South Australia is the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. The Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder is the custodian of all the water owned by the Commonwealth for environmental purposes. But it is asked to release water by the various water owners. There is good evidence that the South Australian government has requested—and it has been acted on—the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder to send water down to the South Australian lakes in order to raise the level of the lakes to allow a sailing regatta to occur at Goolwa. They asked for environmental water to be sent down the river to raise the lakes so they can have a sailing regatta. There is good evidence of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what is the solution we hear from the South Australians? 'Send more water from Victoria and South Australia—and Queensland too, for that matter—down the river to South Australia.' And then they can't even get their rivers right—the Darling and the Murray. They don't even know there is a difference between them. Very little of the water up the Darling River, whether it is stolen or not, ever makes it to South Australia. The average is six per cent—that's it. Hypocrisy knows no bounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My solution to this, my advice, is that New South Wales should simply withdraw from the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and tell South Australia to grow up, stop whingeing and answer a few questions. New South Wales should not rejoin any plan involving the Murray-Darling until South Australia can answer some serious questions. Why can't the Murray River return to being an estuary? That's the natural environment. Why is it being artificially blocked in South Australia, with no justification by the South Australians as to why it shouldn't return to being an estuary, the natural environment? Why can't the water from the south-east drainage program go into the Coorong and save it, like it used to? Why should the barrages stay at Goolwa? Why should New South Wales, Victorian and Queensland farmers sacrifice—and they have paid hugely so far for their involvement in the Murray-Darling Basin plan—so that you can have a sailing regatta on the Lower Lakes at Goolwa in South Australia?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:28</span>):  From the moving of this motion, and from the arguments put in this chamber so far, it is clear that there are two main conclusions to make from the contribution of the Greens—both the presentation of this motion and also the arguments put. One is that the Greens political party, as a movement, is much more interested in problems than solutions. The oxygen that the Greens political party breathes and lives on is around perpetuating a problem, not creating a solution. It is only when problems arise—and problems have arisen over the last couple of months, no-one denies that, in relation to the death of fish in the system—that the Greens appear. They are never involved in trying to find the solution to such problems—the hard work that is involved in getting agreements with a variety of governments and getting support for legislation through parliaments which, obviously, have a variety of different views on a matter like this. Because there is no attempt from the Greens to do that, they can never claim any credit for improvements that are made—and there have been improvements made, as I will go through in my contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point is that, for the Greens political movement, emotion always trumps reason and allegations always trump fact. Their contributions are often devoid of fact and are—at least, certainly in this instance—absent of any knowledge of the local circumstances on the ground within the Murray-Darling, which is an enormous environmental system, obviously incredibly complex. It runs from the headwaters around Toowoomba, west of Brisbane in my home state, all the way down to not quite Adelaide but to the east of Adelaide in South Australia. It's the biggest water catchment in the country. In an average season only around eight per cent of the water that falls around Toowoomba and in western Queensland will end up down at the mouth of the Murray. That's in a normal season. In a dry season, like we've had over the past year, or past couple of years in some places, you'll get much, much less than that, often absolutely nothing at all, because there's no connectivity. As people have remarked to me before, the Murray-Darling is like a big, dry, old carpet. It's not a garden hose. You don't put water in one end of the hose and it comes out the other end. You pour water on one corner of the carpet and, if it's wet enough, if there's enough water across the carpet, water will flow from one end to the other, but only in those circumstances where it is wet. And it certainly hasn't been wet recently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I come back to some of those points, I want to put a few of those local facts on the table here in the Senate, particularly as they relate to my area of Queensland and also northern New South Wales, where it has been incredibly dry these last couple of years. Take the Condamine-Balonne subcatchment within the Murray-Darling. It is broadly centred around St George, which is the largest irrigating community around that area, but it does have other large centres at Miles and Chinchilla, although they rely more on groundwater and surface water extraction. But the average annual consumption in the Balonne system is 1,298 gigalitres a year. I apologise for the jargon. It probably doesn't mean much to people—1,298 gigalitres. That amount of water would be about three Sydney Harbours a year—it's probably a bit under that—that is used in the Condamine-Balonne subcatchments. Just keep in mind that that 1,300 gigalitres is the average annual use of water in that system. Some years it's higher; some years it's lower. In 2017, the use in that area was 156 gigalitres. The average is 1,300 gigalitres and in 2017, a relatively dry year, it was 156 gigalitres. Last year, in 2018, it was 73 gigalitres. So far this season—it hasn't been long, but this is when the water would tend to come in that area—only six gigalitres has been used. That is 1,300 down to 156, down to 73. It will obviously rise above six this year, but unfortunately it might not be much higher than that 2017 low this year either. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an example of how the system responds. We have a system which does respond. When it's dry, the use of water by farmers, primarily by irrigators, reduces. Most of that 73 gigs last year would have probably been stock and domestic use to keep households and animals alive, and in the towns, including St George and Dirranbandi, for town water. There would have been almost zero use of water for irrigation. I'll come back to that question in a second.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, at Cubbie Station, which is often held up, as the Greens have been saying, as corporate farmers or witches—people always want to burn witches in the Murray-Darling Basin. If someone has a witch, that witch has to be burnt. 'If only we could burn that witch, the whole thing would be right.' For some people it's Cubbie Station. For others it's Menindee Lakes. For others it's the Lower Lakes or the Coorong, as Senator Leyonhjelm mentioned. There's always something. 'If only we could get rid of it, everything would be fine.' As I indicated earlier, it's much, much more complex than that. Cubbie Station is sometimes held up as that witch, the witch from western Queensland in this case. Cubbie Station is a large cotton farm in western Queensland. It has not taken any water from the system—not one drop—since 2017. All of last year and so far this year there has not been one allocation of water to Cubbie Station.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But you wouldn't believe that. Over there we heard interjections earlier that it's the big corporate farmers who are responsible here. These corporate farmers are taking the water, and that's preventing the water going to the Menindee or Lower Lakes or lower. The evidence is there, but, as I said earlier, the Greens never resort to bringing a fact to a debate. The facts are all there on the record. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority monitors this very closely. Cubbie Station has not taken any water since 2017.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, around St George—and Cubbie is close to Dirranbandi, which is not too far from St George in Queensland terms, at least—in that immediate area, only one per cent of the area is being planted with cotton or was planted with cotton last year. In a normal year, I think it's about 900 hectares of cotton being planted. That was planted last year because of this lower water use that I mentioned earlier. Down further south—and Senator Williams will be able to speak more about the situation in New South Wales—it's a similar situation in a lot of the dry cotton districts in New South Wales. My understanding is there was no cotton at all grown in Bourke last year, because of the incredibly dry conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings us, I think, to an incredibly important point in this debate. I understand why emotion can come into these types of debates and I completely recognise that those not exposed to irrigation districts or the practices of farmers might work under misconceptions of how crop choice works, how farmers decide what to use. But No. 1, in my view, our farmers are our best environmentalists in this country, for a start. They live on the land. They live off the land. If they don't protect the land, they don't have any livelihood for themselves or their families. They know exactly how the environment works and how brutal it can be. They must manage it for the their long-term sustainability and that of their families. The way the system works is that a farmer will be provided with an allocation of water each year. They'll have an entitlement to a certain amount of water. Each year, depending on how much water is in the dam, they'll be allocated a certain amount of water. I mentioned earlier that the allocations in the Balonne have been something like six per cent of their average amount at the moment, and that leaves them less water to use.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In many parts of the system, particularly up in the north, in the upper Darling and Condamine-Balonne areas of the system, water uses can be very variable. There aren't as many dams in that part of the system as there are in the southern part of the system, so you can have a lot more variability in water availability, as we've seen in the last decade. We've had very, very large rainfall in the last decade and 100 per cent allocations for many seasons, but in the last couple of years that's reversed and we've had dry conditions. In that environment, obviously, you want to pick a crop that can respond to that variability. You don't want to plant something or grow something which is going to need water every year without question. That's why in many parts of this system exposed to this variability we have farmers growing what are called 'annual' crops, where you choose every year whether to plant that particular crop. Cotton is one of those. Rice is the other major annual crop in the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, because we have a variable climate, because we know we're a country of flooding rains and droughts, we often have farming systems that respond to that variability and allow a farmer to choose to plant every year. That is the best choice not just for the farmer but for the system as a whole, because it can then respond flexibly to that variability. I want to bust this myth that cotton is terrible and you shouldn't grow it. Actually, because of the variable system, cotton is a perfect crop for that, because, when it's wet it can be very wet, as we've seen in the last decade. It's been very wet around St George for many years with floods. It's sometimes hard to remember those years, but they were only in the last decade. When it's wet, you can ramp up the cotton use. You can plant a lot of cotton and use the water. It's largely going to evaporate anyway; as I said, the whole system is not a garden hose; a lot of it will evaporate. So you can use that water, put it to productive use, make wealth for our country, create jobs and create vibrant communities and towns like St George, which are brilliant places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, in the years when it's dry, as we've just seen, the farmers pull back. They pull all that production back. I know it's the same in the rice-growing districts around Murrumbidgee in Senator Williams's part of the world. We don't grow rice much in Queensland, but down in those areas where rice can be grown they'll do the same thing. I haven't got the stats, but I know that in the previous drought they went back to well over 90 per cent reduction in their rice production during the worst of the drought. They can do that because it's very variable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you plant trees, like there are a lot of in South Australia—there's no problem with that; I'm not criticising, but in the South Australian growing districts there are a lot of almond orchards et cetera—they need water every year. You can't rip those plants out when it's dry. So they've invested a lot more in reticulated systems, saving water, in response to the crop choice that they've had in that area. Likewise in Victoria, with again a less variable system and more dams, they have dairy cattle. Cattle need to be fed food and grass every year. You can't just scale your water use back up and down. The system works a lot better because of that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because, as I mentioned, the northern part of the system is not as regulated—there are not as many dams and water use is more variable—that system is exposed to the types of events we've seen in the past few months around the death of fish. We've all been touched by that tragedy. It's an unfortunate aspect of nature that we do have floods and then droughts. It does lead to these kinds of events. You can see this locally on the ground. This is a problem with this debate. Not enough people who have contributed to this debate have spent enough time in the areas of the basin where these events occur. They'll turn up for the photo shoot. They'll turn up when the fish die, do a 30-second social media post and then fly back to the city and not think twice about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take Copeton Dam in the Gwydir catchment. Right now it's pretty dry in that area, as it is across many areas. Downstream of Copeton Dam, downstream of the wall, where they can regulate the river because they release water as per need, there are no fish kills. The dam has been able to keep, for now at least, the river full and regulated to an appropriate temperature and height, and there are no fish kills. Just upstream of Copeton Dam in that same local area there have been fish kills, because obviously you can't regulate the water. I might have to step through this for the Greens. Upstream of a dam you can't regulate the amount of water in that river. You can't pump water back up the river. You can only send it down the river. So upstream of the dam there have been fish kills. Downstream of the dam there haven't been any fish kills. This is in the same local area. Why? It's because we have a dam, that's why. The more we have dams, the fewer fish kills we have. The more you can regulate a system, the better you can manage the environment and make sure you don't have these types of events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, we are exposed to these types of events in the upper Darling in western Queensland because we do not have the same amount of water infrastructure as they have in South Australia with all the locks. You have locks all through South Australia. You can regulate the flow of water. You have the Hume Dam, the Dartmouth Dam and the barrages. You can regulate your system. That's fine; there's no problem with that. But up country we don't have such regulation, for largely good reasons. The topography is not as attractive to the construction of dams as it is in South Australia. So we have to manage these things. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on about this for a long time, but I want to spend some time coming to that point about solutions. We need to find solutions. That is what we as a government have been focused on. I also recognise the efforts of the previous government, who came to an agreement with the states which has been concluded under our government. But it looks like they might be supporting this ridiculous notion, which I suppose is the irresponsibility that comes with opposition. But in government we try to find solutions where we bring parties together, bring states and territories together and get a better-fit deal for South Australia. No-one is questioning the fact that water has been overallocated in the system in the past. That's why we have gone through a more-than-10-year process here to reduce water use in the Murray-Darling Basin and to do so in a way that is responsible, common sense and leads to better outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had better outcomes. We have had enormous watering events right across the Murray-Darling Basin which have led to better environmental outcomes in the Macquarie Marshes, the Lower Lakes and at Menindee as well, notwithstanding the dry conditions they're facing at the moment. But because of the limitations of our infrastructure, because we don't have dams everywhere, we are still going to suffer situations where there is not enough water: not enough water for towns, for farmers, for the environment and for fish as well. We're never going to completely resolve that situation because we cannot build enough dams to store water long enough to get us through the dry period. Anybody who tells you otherwise is selling you absolute snake oil. It cannot happen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have to do is find the best way to manage a scarce resource in the system, to ensure that it is appropriately allocated, so that we can have vibrant communities that produce food for our nation and so that we can have and protect the wonderful environment we have, and that's a managed environment. Senator Leyonhjelm was right when he said that the Lower Lakes and other parts of the South Australian system are regulated. They're not like they were when there was no-one from European countries here, but that's fine. We have made, in my view, a better system through those regulation dams because we can at least manage them. If we didn't have those dams, we would probably have fish kills downstream of Copeton Dam—we almost certainly would right now—but, because we have Copeton Dam, we don't. So that is a good outcome.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. The one thing I think we really have improved on is putting a cap on the amount of buyback from the system. Those on the other side of this debate would have you believe that that has put a cap on the amount of water that can be returned to the environment. That is wrong. There has always been, under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—before we were in government and now—a variety of means to recover water. One of the ways is to buy directly from farmers, willing sellers, to take that water out of the system. The other main way is to improve the efficiency of the system by lining channels and by better levelling our country. You save water, and the saved water can go back to environmental purposes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our view, we've got to have an appropriate balance. That's because, as we've seen—Senator Williams, myself and others, and I think Senator Ruston was mentioning similar outcomes—when you buy too much water out of an individual community you take away the economic base of that community. It has enormous impacts, not just on the irrigators—actually, the irrigators do okay because they get to sell their water and do something else with their life—but also on the local petrol station, the local newsagent and the coffee shop in town. They are left destitute because they no longer have the business that they did when the irrigation was in the community. So we've got to find that appropriate balance. I know—I've been out to Dirranbandi since we started this process, and it's had a terrible impact on that town. I think we've managed that better since we've been in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I firmly believe that what we need to do going forward is ensure we continue the good work of this government in finding a sustainable outcome to this problem. It is a wicked problem. But the outcome that will be sustainable for the long term is one that still creates food production and jobs in the Murray-Darling; still creates social communities where people can have the confidence to invest and buy houses in their local towns and join sporting clubs—do all the great things people in communities do; and also protects the environment for the long term. If we don't do those three things, if we just focus on one, it won't be a sustainable solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One reason is there'll be in-built issues that will come back to get us. The other reason is political reactions—there will be a political reaction if we don't properly manage all of those issues. Notwithstanding what we've seen over summer, the system is much better than it was 10 years ago. It's moving in the right direction. All of the responsible people in this parliament need to keep contributing to the good work that has been done.</span>

                  <a href="HDA" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CORMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I had not intended to contribute to this debate, but given some of the assertions that have been made by some contributors in this debate I think it is very important that, on behalf of our national government, I summarise the position of the government succinctly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make it very, very clear at the outset that the government will not be removing the 1,500-gigalitre cap on surface-water buybacks. We are currently 276 gigalitres below the cap, as has been mentioned by others. This is well beyond the amount of water we actually need to achieve sustainable diversion limits under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. At present, just 30 gigalitres of surface water is needed to bridge the gap to the Basin Plan's SDLs. The government legislated the cap in 2015 to provide greater certainty to basin communities, and that has been an incredibly important reform indeed. Open buybacks have been shown to have negative social and economic consequences. The Northern Basin Review and the report on the southern basin communities made these impacts very clear. We have made very good progress towards the Basin Plan's water recovery targets, and we remain committed to ensuring these targets are achieved. The initiative by Labor and the Greens here today puts these significant achievements at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back on 14 December 2018, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council agreed a number of key actions, including the application of additional social, economic and associated assessment processes for efficiency measures: projects that contribute to the additional 450 gigalitres to be recovered for the environment; a commitment by New South Wales and Queensland to protecting environmental water; the provision of high-quality, well-consulted water resource plans for accreditation; and the creation of a permanent Indigenous member position on the Murray-Darling Basin Authority board. What the Greens are trying to do today is essentially to hijack this whole process and try to make a unilateral decision that would make the situation worse. It would manifestly and demonstrably make the situation worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth and the basin states are working to ensure sustainable diversion limits take effect from 1 July 2019 and to have all of the relevant plans accredited by the end of 2019. The government will continue to work with basin states on delivering the outcomes of the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism in the Northern Basin Review to meet the sustainable diversion limits in 2019. We have also taken action to improve compliance and enforcement across the basin through the appointment of Mick Keelty as the Northern Basin Commissioner and a $20 million investment in improved hydromatic and satellite monitoring. When it comes to the delivery of the Basin Plan, the government is getting on with the job. We are working with all relevant stakeholders to ensure that we continue to take the most appropriate way forward that is fair to everyone and delivers the best possible environmental outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Murray-Darling Basin is facing difficult times. We have seen that this summer, with fish deaths across the system and communities and irrigators being without water. We are responding and taking appropriate action to those recent events. The fish deaths we have seen over recent months are absolutely horrible. On 24 January 2019, the New South Wales government <span style="font-style:italic;">Fish death interim investigation report</span> found that the devastating fish death events in recent months appear to be a result of a range of factors—primarily, the breakdown of the stratification of water layers but also the breakdown of organic matter, algal blooms and the high temperatures followed by cooler periods. The poor inflow conditions are not unique to Menindee and the lower Darling. They are being experienced in systems across the northern basin. Without rain it is true that further fish deaths are a possibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray-Darling Basin Authority convened meetings of water managers, environmental water holders and state fisheries experts to look at the immediate risk of further fish deaths and at options to mitigate and avoid this risk where feasible. The government also announced $5 million in funding through the Murray-Darling Basin Authority for the development of a native fish management and recovery strategy. This strategy will support the emergency response and recovery actions and additional research into native fish stocks and their management. An independent panel, chaired by Professor Robert Vertessy, has been established to identify the causes of the fish deaths in the lower Darling and to make recommendations on strategies to prevent similar events in the future. Only the other week, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority announced that up to 26 gigalitres of environmental water would be released to the lower Murrumbidgee over coming weeks to improve river flows and help reduce the risk of further fish losses in the lower Murrumbidgee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales Department of Primary Industries has also commenced a rescue effort involving the movement of fish to the lower Darling or to some of the New South Wales government hatcheries. Basin governments are working together in doing everything possible to respond to recent events and to mitigate the risk of similar events occurring in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Achieving the best possible outcomes in the Murray-Darling is not going to be helped by this latest stunt by the Greens political party. The truth is that the Greens political party has now gazumped nearly two hours of government business time. We've got about 2½ sitting days left this week. There's a lot of important legislation on the agenda. We've had lots of non-government senators contributing to this debate. I counted at least three non-government senators before the government got the call back. The point I would make to the chamber is: reflect very carefully on the workload. There are normal, routine processes available to anyone who actually, in good faith and genuinely, wants to introduce a piece of legislation rather than to pursue a stunt. There is an established Senate process available to the Greens if what they want to do is introduce legislation. It is rather novel to have a Greens senator moving a motion to introduce a Labor bill. I mean, I'm—</span>

                  </a>  Oh, apparently there is a Labor-Greens coalition starting to get formed. I gather that there are some other discussions taking place elsewhere in order to ensure that Labor gets closer to the Greens again when it comes to weakening our border protection arrangements. That is, of course, the other conversation that is taking place around the parliament today: Labor getting captured by the Greens, getting moved by the Greens into ever worse policy positions. And so what I would say to the Australian people is: be very careful about a Labor-Greens alliance on the other side of the election. I can tell you that the Liberal-National coalition will continue to make our country stronger, will continue to make our economy stronger and will continue to make our border stronger, whereas, of course, any Labor-Greens alternative, as is being witnessed again today, would make our country weaker, would make our borders weaker and would put the Murray-Darling Basin in a worse position, in a weaker, environmentally less sound position. So what I would say to the Australian—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Senator Wong could refer to the clock—if Senator Wong could have a short look at the clock—she'd see I've got another minute and a half to share my pearls of wisdom with Senator Wong and the chamber. What I would like Senator Wong to understand is that between now and the election we will be fighting every single day for a stronger Australia, for stronger borders, for an Australia where Australian families have the best possible opportunity to get ahead and where we're doing the right thing by the environment in a way that is economically responsible. We will continue as a strong and united team. We will continue to work, as a strong and united team, to do the right thing by the environment in a way that is economically responsible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Greens stance, seeking to pursue Labor legislation, is not the way to do the right thing by the environment in a way that is economically or socially responsible. Of course, it seeks to cut across very important processes designed to ensure that the way forward is fair and environmentally, socially and economically sustainable for all of the relevant communities involved. This attempt by the Greens to hijack this very important process today is not in our national interest. The Liberal and National coalition, as we always do, will stand up for what is right. We will stand up for a stronger Australia and we will continue to fight the attempt of the Labor Party to make Australia weaker and to make Australians poorer. With those few words, Mr President, I think I might finish my contribution to this debate. But I have not yet sat down. I don't know that— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

They are very much stuck in the past. The very sensible comments made by former Prime Minister Turnbull the other day are 100 per cent consistent with the comments he made as Prime Minister in relation to the banking royal commission after the inquiry got underway, entirely consistent with the comments that our now Prime Minister made as the then Treasurer in relation to the royal commission after it was underway and entirely consistent with the comments that I made some months ago in relation to the calling of the banking royal commission.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make a number of observations. Firstly, it was the Liberal-National government that called the royal commission, it was the Liberal-National government that determined the terms of reference, it was the Liberal-National government that chose Commissioner Hayne—who did an outstanding job, as is widely recognised—to conduct this royal commission and it is the Liberal-National coalition which is now taking action in relation to the 76 recommendations that were made by Commissioner Hayne. What have we had from the Labor Party? All we've had from the Labor Party are weasel words. Following the Shorten precedent, the shadow Treasurer said, 'We will back all of the recommendations sight unseen.' Even before the report was delivered he said, 'We'll be supporting them, whatever they are.' But guess what happened after the report was released? Instead of saying, 'We'll support all the recommendations,' Labor said, 'We support all the recommendations in principle.' We still don't know what Labor's position is.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before joining this chamber, in a past life Senator Sinodinos was the chief of staff to one of our most distinguished and outstanding Prime Ministers in our history ever. I would just refer you to a very important statement that he made in relation to our borders. He made this point:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's about this nation saying to the world we are a generous open hearted people taking more refugees on a per capita basis than any nation except Canada, we have a proud record of welcoming people from 140 different nations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But we will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came into government in 2013, after Labor had dismantled the successful border protection policies of the Howard government, we inherited chaos and dysfunction on our border: 50,000 illegal arrivals by boat, on 800 boats; 1,200 deaths at sea. It took our efforts to fix the absolute chaos and dysfunction that we inherited, to put back a strong border protection framework.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And you'd think that Labor would have learned from their mistakes. No; they are at it again. Senator Sinodinos asked why it is important. Let me say why it is important. We have delivered a human dividend that is both compassionate and fair. We have stopped the deaths at sea. We have closed 19 detention centres. Remember that there were more than 8,000 children in detention under the previous Labor-Green government. Now there are none. All the children are off Nauru, or have their bags packed for the United States. That's what strong border protection delivers. Our plan is simple. We won't change it, we won't weaken it. We know that Bill Shorten, in a desperate attempt to score some tactical political points, is prepared to compromise our national security, is prepared to compromise our border security arrangements. He should stand condemned for it. The Australian people can't trust Bill Shorten with our borders.</span>

We have welcomed generations and generations of migrants from all corners of the world. Indeed, we have welcomed to Australia many, many thousands of refugees and asylum seekers from all around the world. But, as John Howard quite rightly pointed out, we decide who comes to this country and the circumstance in which they come. In our system, the Australian people give expression to their wishes at an election. It is up to the elected government of Australia to determine how our borders are managed. There should not be any suggestion whatsoever that this is a responsibility that should be contracted out. It is absolutely unbelievable to us on this side of the chamber that, after Labor's disastrous track record on this, they would go back there and try to fiddle with this when their last attempt to fiddle with this had such disastrous consequences. The Australian people will condemn them for it.</span>

It was Prime Minister Morrison who as Treasurer introduced the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which, of course, is designed to hold banking executives to account and which was absolutely supported, positively supported, by the royal commissioner. In fact, he wants us to expand it into other areas. It was Scott Morrison as the Treasurer who led the charge, alongside Kelly O'Dwyer as the relevant minister at the time, when it came to the establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. It was Scott Morrison as the Treasurer who made sure that ASIC and APRA had more resources and more power so that they could do their job effectively. Indeed, it was Scott Morrison as the Treasurer who led the charge when it came to putting the terms of reference together for the banking royal commission and, indeed, when it came to the decision-making in relation to the appointment of the royal commissioner. It is Scott Morrison now, as Prime Minister, who will lead the charge in our response. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, we're back for our first question time after summer, and since we were last here we've had the hottest-ever January on record, we've seen some of the most devastating bushfires ever in Tasmania, we've seen the Darling River with a million dead fish and we've also seen those horrific torrential rains and flash flooding in Queensland. Minister, do you accept now that these are not simply natural disasters but, indeed, are the result of the breakdown of our climate system?</span>

The first point I would make is that, of course, the government is absolutely committed to effective action on climate change. I want to just remind people that Australia has exceeded the emissions reduction targets for Kyoto 1, is on track to exceed the emissions reduction targets for Kyoto 2, and that we will meet and probably exceed our emissions reduction target of 26 per cent on 2005 levels agreed to in Paris by 2030.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would say is that on this side of the chamber we believe that we can pursue effective action on climate change in a way that is economically responsible. We don't believe that whacking on a higher tax will be an effective way to address climate change when all it will do is shift emissions, alongside jobs and economic activity, to other parts of the world where emissions will be higher for the same amount of economic output, which, as I seem to recall, must have been the Greens' position when the Greens voted with the Liberal-National Party to defeat Labor's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. If you were so committed to a carbon pollution reduction scheme, why didn't you vote for it? I mean, you come in here, week in, week out, trying to take the high moral ground. The truth is that when you had the chance, you didn't do it. I mean, when you had the chance, I could only assume that you took our view that we needed effective environmental action in a way that was economically responsible, and that is why you sided with us in voting down Labor's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. So don't ask questions of us.</span>

We are on track to deliver the outcomes that we promised for the future. That has been consistently our position over the last five-and-a-half-years. So, Senator Di Natale, maybe you should ask yourself a question, or maybe you should ask Senator Siewert a question: why she, alongside Senator Hanson-Young, voted with Liberal-National senators against Senator Wong over the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.

I'm looking at Senator Colbeck, who has a fantastic front page, if someone could pass that on to me? Remember Dr Bob Brown? You know what he said? 'Coal power—best option'. That was of course when he was opposing the hydro power in Tasmania. It is true that coal is one important energy source and is also an important export product for Australia, but on our side of the Senate, on our side of the chamber, we are committed to effective action on climate change in a way that is economically responsible. What that means is we're pursuing sensible policy when it comes to promoting renewable energies— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The truth is that Australian coal, when it displaces dirty coal in many other parts of the world, makes a magnificent contribution to environmental outcomes. If you want us to stop exporting cleaner Australian coal so that it can be substituted with dirtier coal overseas, if that makes you feel better that we have somehow sacrificed jobs in Australia, hurt families, damaged the economy, but you feel better, even though emissions in the world are up by more, if that makes you feel better, that is not our way to do business for the Australian people. We care about people as well as the environment. We care about making sure the economy is stronger so that families around Australia have the best possible opportunity to get ahead.</span>

Yesterday the media ran a story saying Minister Littleproud asked the working group reviewing pet food regulation to expedite its work. That group was set up following the outbreak of incurable megaesophagus, which struck down well over 100 dogs and which Melbourne University's U-vet linked to ADVANCE Dermocare dry dog food. The Senate inquiry into the safety of the $4 billion pet food industry tabled its report in October last year. This report made seven recommendations, including that the working group be directed to look at mechanisms for mandatory pet food standards and mandatory labelling requirements, and also consider better testing such as feeding trials in the standards. Has the minister directed the working group to consider the recommendations of the Senate report, and to also review the evidence and submissions presented to the inquiry?</span>

Minister Littleproud has welcomed the findings of the parliamentary inquiry into the pet food industry. As you mentioned, Senator Griff, the report was released late last year, October last year, with a number of recommendations around standards and accountability. Minister Littleproud has written to his state and territory counterparts following that review, requesting support for a review into the safety and regulation of pet food. My understanding is that all states and territories have replied and support such a review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Littleproud has advised me that the review working group that is taking forward this review has met twice. It is reviewing the Australian standards for the manufacturing and marketing of pet food and the legislation covering pet food. The group will report back to the agricultural senior officials committee within the next 12 months. The safety and regulation of pet food was last reviewed in 2012. The Australian standard for the manufacturing and marketing of pet food was developed at that time. This standard was reviewed and updated in 2017. Australia exports a range of pet food products which are regulated differently depending on product risk file and importing country requirements, although my understanding and advice here is that most of the regulation around pet food is handled by states and territories in consultation through the COAG process.</span>

Given it has been four months since the Senate inquiry submitted its report, and over a year since those dogs died, can you advise when the government intends to release its response to the Senate inquiry recommendations? If you can't provide a date, will you guarantee that the government will respond before we go to an election?</span>

Given the minister has now agreed to appear before the court later this week on this matter, will she cooperate with the court by giving a full and frank account of her involvement in the leaking of details of the Federal Police raid on AWU offices to the media?</span>

Following on from what the Leader of the Government in the Senate articulated earlier today, we've put in place the policies that have enabled the coalition government to stop the boats. That's right—policies have been put in place to stop the boats. But, in particular, Mr President, those policies consist of, as you know, turn-backs, which is something that those on the other side said would never work. Well, guess what? We didn't blink, we put them in place and the policy has been proven to be effective. We also enforced offshore processing. Offshore processing is a key tenet of putting in place policies that secure Australia's borders.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But those on the other side are not interested in border protection. They are interested in outsourcing Australia's border protection and national security. They are interested in handing it back over to the people smugglers. We know what the legacy is, as Senator Cormann said, but let's go through it again so that the Australian public understands the very, very clear difference between those of us on the coalition side, who will protect our borders every step of the way, and those on the other side, who were ready this week to say to the people smugglers, 'Come on down.' Fifty thousand people arrived on over 800 boats, 1,200 people died at sea and over 8,000 children were detained in detention whilst those on the other side, Labor, were in government. They were forced to open 17 detention centres to deal with the influx of boat arrivals. We believe in strong policy measures and we will stand by them.</span>

That is why, when it comes to protecting our borders, you need to put in place the tough policies, which we have done, to stop the boats. But, after that, you need to show resolve, especially when you are faced with the type of behaviour we see from those opposite in the Labor Party and, of course, the Australian Greens, Labor's partner in crime. The legacy left to this government by those on the other side is shameful, and we never want to see a return to the chaos on the borders. </span>

We don't need to name to them individually; it's just an absolute bloc. But there are also those on the other side, some of whom are fundamentally committed to reopening our borders. They have no issues at all with handing over border security to the people smugglers. At a previous election, Mr Rudd said to the Australian people he'd be tough on border security. Was he tough on border security? No, because the legacy lives on today—50,000 boat arrivals, 800 boats, 1,200 deaths at sea, children in detention and 17 detention centres opened. And then, of course, there's the cost of all this to the Australian taxpayer, because it's their money that is actually being wasted by those on the other side—in excess of $11 billion. We do not want to return to that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:35</span>):  My question is to Senator Cash, who is representing the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Dutton. Everybody in this chamber, and probably across Australia, knows I've campaigned for years on one issue—I've even been to jail over it!—and that's the need for a national public register of convicted child-sex offenders. I want to compliment the Morrison government for embracing my long campaign, and my thanks go to Mr Dutton for getting most, if not all, of what I wanted through cabinet. We now need the cooperation of state and territory governments, and my question is: what progress, if any, has been made, and is it now on the COAG agenda?</span>

I do acknowledge your longstanding interest in relation to child-sex offender reforms. I do also acknowledge the comments you made in relation to the government, and, of course, we remain strongly committed to safeguarding children from sexual abuse in Australia, online and abroad.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to your question, the government is working with states and territories and key non-government stakeholders to establish the national public register of child-sex offenders to deter offenders and enhance community safety. We need, as you know, this nationally consistent approach. It is vital to afford nationwide community protection and ensure offenders cannot exploit jurisdictional differences to evade public scrutiny. I am advised that the Department of Home Affairs has consulted states and territories and targeted non-government stakeholders on a preliminary model. The department has received feedback through written submissions, as well as via a multijurisdictional teleconference with senior law and justice officials. I also understand that the minister is now considering the outcomes of this initial consultation process.</span>

                  </a>  There is no basis on which Senator Wong can deduce that Senator Cash in any way misled the Senate based on her answers to the questions that she has asked. Senator Wong made a number of assertions about what somebody else asserted today. As Senator Cash very clearly indicated in her answers today, her statements to Senate estimates and since have been based on her state of knowledge. As I understand from her answers, her state of knowledge hasn't changed. The point of order is to reject the proposition of Senator Wong that somehow there is an answer to be provided in relation to misleading the Senate. There isn't, because I think that Senator Cash's answers to the first two questions were self-explanatory. Senator Cash made very clear—in fact she was emphatic, in particular, in relation to the second question, answering 'yes and yes'—that she maintains and stands by the statements that she has made, and the statement in relation to the first matter was based on her state of knowledge at the time. There is nothing that has indicated that her state of knowledge has changed since that time, irrespective of the statements that may or may not have been made by a third party.</span>

                  </a>  I didn't clarify the point I was making, and the Leader of the Government in the Senate has responded perhaps on a different point. The point I was making and that we seek your ruling on is the minister's assertion that because this is before the courts she ought not have to answer. My point of order to you is that the sub judice rule does not apply in these circumstances. The question goes to correcting the Senate record, not to a matter which may prejudice a finding before the court.</span>

                  </a>  On that same point, what Senator Wong has put to Senator Cash are statements that were made by a witness in some proceedings which are yet to be tested. It is entirely inappropriate for Senator Cash to be asked to provide a running commentary in relation to statements that apparently have been made. She has consistently put her position based on her state of knowledge. She has confirmed her position again today. If Senator Wong is asserting that somehow what Senator Cash is saying is not in her state of mind then she should say that. She cannot ask Senator Cash to provide a running commentary on the evidence provided by a witness in a court proceeding.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of it being inappropriate or sub judice, I'm not going to say this matter as asked by Senator Wong breaches those principles. This matter is not before a jury or a magistrate, I understand, today and I don't foresee this necessarily prejudicing the procedures that, I understand, are currently before the court. However, I cannot direct the minister how to answer a question. It is entirely appropriate for the minister to refer to past statements and potentially to future events that may be coming up, and that is a matter for others to judge. It is not for me to direct a minister to make a statement or otherwise; it is a matter for the contest of the Senate. Senator Bernardi, on a point of order?</span>

Senator Wong put forward some statements that she said had been made in the court today. The minister, in her response, said, 'I'm not aware of those statements,' and so she can't be drawn on responding to them. Is it in order for people to put allegations to a minister and then for them to have to respond to something that they're not aware of?</span>

The minister would be well aware that the area I live in in North Queensland, where I'm based, has been subject to very severe rain and flooding events in the past week. I ask the minister: could he update the Senate on the impact that these floods have had on the people of North Queensland? I know the minister and most of us here understand, particularly through media reports and through the visit of the Prime Minister, what's happened in Townsville, but could you perhaps indicate, Minister, as I'm interested in this as well: what is happening in the north-west part of Queensland, in the areas of the western part of the electorate of Kennedy, which have also been very severely affected by floods, with what I read to be great loss of livestock?</span>

There have been multiple disasters wrapped up in one. There's been the immediate impact of the flood and the monsoon low on Townsville, near where Senator Macdonald lives and where his office is located, which has done enormous damage to households and resulted in the tragic loss of two lives. There's been enormous damage to our agricultural sector and the loss of many, many stock. The numbers will probably never be known. Of course, in these types of events there's always damage to infrastructure, which cuts towns off, sometimes for months, and it takes a while to rebuild. We also recognise that the tough times to come in that rebuilding exercise are something we will be there for to make sure local communities can do that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't have as much knowledge on this event as others in this chamber. I know Senator O'Sullivan has been to visit these areas. I appreciate Senator Reynolds's time up in North Queensland in responding so quickly to people's needs. I also of course want to pay tribute to the emergency services personnel, who did such a fantastic job on the ground. I suppose it was in some senses fortunate that Townsville had a military base right there. The Army did a sensational job, may I say, particularly in helping to get people out of harm's way when uncontrolled releases from the Ross River Dam occurred. At their peak, those releases were flowing out at 2,000 cubic metres per second, and they occurred overnight. While they were anticipated by a few hours, it wasn't a long time to prepare.</span>

They perhaps haven't had as much of the focus, but the sugar industry around Burdekin has had significant losses. I was contacted yesterday by a grazier from Etheridge shire, which has also had significant losses. This has been a widespread disaster and it will take efforts from state and federal governments to make sure we respond properly. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I ask the minister if he could tell the Senate what the government is doing to assist those who've been affected by the floods. I know the emergency services minister, Senator Reynolds, has been just about living in those flood areas herself and helping out with assistance, but could the minister tell the Senate what the government has been offering to date?</span>

That's just in the last six days. I do thank and pay tribute to the officials. Senator Reynolds is leading a fantastic team with Emergency Management Australia. They have honed their responses to these types of events. I have seen that firsthand in others. They have processed now almost 33,000 claims across those six days. I don't have the particular information here in front of me, but the last time I looked at it just under 90 per cent of claims had been processed in a matter of days. That disaster payment is a one-off payment of $1,000 for eligible households and $400 if they have children. My message mainly, though, is to anybody who needs assistance: please get on to us.</span>

The minister will be aware that many farmers in the north-west who've been looking after livestock for years in a drought situation, hand-feeding them, have now in many cases lost all of their livestock, and there's been very substantial damage. I'm wondering if the minister could indicate what the government is doing to assist farmers who've had such heavy losses with their stock and their land?</span>

Already the government has lifted the assistance available to all primary producers from $25,000 to $75,000. That funding, I believe, is already flowing. We also have a range of concessional loans for farmers, and the ADF is providing assistance to get fuel and fodder out to those farms that need it. But the main thing that I want to focus on is not what we have done but what we will do. We will make sure we'll be here for the long term for these communities. It will take many months, if not years, for some areas to recover from this event, and my message to them is: the government is with you to help. We will do everything we can make to make sure people get back on their feet. There is a bright future for many of these areas, particularly given the rain they have received; they will just need a lot of assistance and help to get there, and we're going to provide it to them.</span>

We welcome the Thai government's decision to allow Mr al-Araibi to return to Australia. We know that all Australians deeply appreciate the decision allowing him to return to his wife, his family and friends. I want to commend the Thai government's commitment to due process and to human rights, which has led the government to take this decision. We know it was not an easy decision. The issue was not of Thailand's making. The circumstances in relation to this matter have been subject to a review.</span>

I'm proud of the extensive efforts of the Australian government, with the support of so many actors in the Australian and international community, in bringing Mr al-Araibi home. I would like to thank the Australian diplomatic network: officials in our embassies in Bangkok and Riyadh, which has representation to Bahrain, and in DFAT Canberra, who have worked behind the scenes for months to secure Mr al-Araibi's release. I also want to acknowledge the members of this chamber and of the other place for their engagement with me on this issue—in this chamber: Senator Wong and Senator Di Natale; and in the other place: Mr Bert van Manen, the member for Forde, with Senator Watt, in their co-convening of the parliamentary football group.</span>

The outpouring of support from the Pascoe Vale Football Club to the advocacy of Mr Craig Foster, Football Federation Australia, FIFA, the IOC, Australian athletes within the Olympic family, the United Nations and so many other human rights groups and so many other Australians is a testament to how deeply Mr al-Araibi's situation has touched Australians. </span>

Throughout Mr al-Araibi's detention, the Prime Minister and I maintained regular and respectful contact with our Thai counterparts, including during my own visit to Bangkok in early January. We deeply appreciate the way in which Thailand has engaged with Australia throughout Mr al-Araibi's detention, which is reflective of the strength of that partnership.</span>

Thailand is our ninth-largest trading partner. We'll also be working very closely with Thailand this year in support of its role as chair of ASEAN.</span>

Mr Morrison ran a protection racket for his big-end-of-town mates. And now with his part-time parliament, he's continuing that behaviour of protection.</span>

Mr Morrison was the last hold out; he was the very last one in the Liberal Party who finally caved and said: 'Okay. All right. We'll go ahead with the royal commission.' He only did that after the banks sent him a letter to do it. What's he doing now? Mr Morrison and Mr Frydenberg want to kick this reform off into the never-never. They say they won't do anything about that urgent issue until 2021. So what we're seeing today is a government, which voted against a royal commission 26 times, that has the hide to come in here and say it's doing a good job in response to that royal commission into banking—banking that we interact with every single day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the royal commission and all of the stories that we heard of families and people that were profoundly impacted have revealed a sector that has been operating in a manner that puts itself ahead of people, ahead of ethics and ahead of the law. And Mr Morrison did not see that. He didn't see it before. He opposed it on 26 occasions. He held it up for 600 days. He delayed the commencement of that inquiry by 18 months. We could have legislated by now. We could have done the work to protect the Australian people if this arrogant, out-of-touch government had listened to the people of Australia, had listened to the evidence of people walking these corridors day in and day out and telling us there was something rotten in the banks. If this government had the dignity of a real government and had the sense to listen, we would've had a response to the banking royal commission long before this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After Mr Morrison had called the action of establishing the royal commission 'regrettable' and 'a populist whinge', now we finally have the report. With the report in their hands, do you think that the government could show up to work and undertake the legislation that needs to be undertaken to give protection to the Australian people? No, they're too busy with their infighting. They're too busy with the internecine warfare going on in the family of the Liberal Party. They're fighting with the Nats. The Nats are fighting with the Nats. The Libs are fighting with the Libs, former Libs and independents. People in that party are in a state of decay. They've decided that they know better than anybody else what should happen with the banks and they've decided that they're not going to come along and do the work that the Australian people need them to do, to protect us and to protect the very underpinning of business in this country, our banking sector. We all rely on it. We all need it to be ethical. We need it to be managed properly and the government— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:06</span>):  It is great to be back for a new parliamentary year. Welcome back, colleagues. I regret to say, though, that it appears the opposition has decided to start the new parliamentary year by taking the low road. Instead of focusing themselves today on weighty matters of state and substantive issues of policy, they've decided to pursue a strategy of personal smear, personal destruction and personal attack. It's a familiar theme for those opposite and I have no doubt that, further on in the taking note of answers debate, we'll hear more of it. As a government, though, we're focused on the things that actually matter to the people of Australia and actually affect their lives.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator PATERSON:</span>
                  </a>  I'll take up Senator O'Neill's interjection about the banking royal commission. The opposition is very focused on playing petty politics here and on point scoring about who called for a royal commission when. They're very fond of pointing out the fact that they called for a royal commission before we did. What they're less fond of admitting to and acknowledging is that, in fact, there was a time when they too opposed a royal commission and when they voted against a royal commission after the Greens first presented a motion calling for one here in this chamber. We could have a debate about who was first in favour of it and who has been in favour of it longest, or we could instead focus on the 76 substantive recommendations made by Commissioner Hayne, how they will improve the lives of Australian people and how they will improve trust in the banking system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when the government received the royal commission's recommendations, the opposition made a big song and dance about how we were taking far too long to release the report and far too long to respond to it. Well, in just a matter of days, the government was able to release, in full, a comprehensive response to the banking royal commission and allow the markets and the Australian public to observe our response. The opposition, on the other hand, who have now had twice the length of time that the government took to provide a response, are yet to provide any substantive response to the royal commission. Prior to the release of the recommendations, they said that they would implement them in full. What a careless, unthinking promise that was to make. Actually, now that they've realised that perhaps there might be a recommendation or two in there that they're not completely delighted by—or, more importantly, key constituencies of theirs, such as the union movement and the industry super funds that they control, might not be completely delighted by—they've instead moved to say that they will adopt all 76 recommendations 'in principle', whatever that means. We're yet to learn what that means. Yet they have the gall to come in here, to this chamber and to the other place, and say that this parliament needs to sit for extra weeks so that we can progress the recommendations that they don't even know what they're going to do with yet—quite a claim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another observation made today by those opposite, which no doubt we will hear more of this week, is the 26 times which the government is alleged to have voted against a royal commission. I haven't checked that figure; I'm not sure it's right. One figure that I do know is absolutely right, though, is the 22 times that those opposite in this chamber voted for a piece of legislation that their opposition leader and their shadow cabinet are now desperately trying to amend in the lower house because they've realised the disastrous consequences of that bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every single one of you voted for a bill that your leader and your shadow cabinet now acknowledge could have allowed child sex offenders, murderers and other criminals to come to Australia without any recourse for the minister to prevent that from happening, without any recourse at all. You voted for a piece of legislation 22 times that even the opposition leader, Mr Shorten, recognises now is a dangerous piece of legislation that urgently needs to be amended in the House of Representatives. If they're successful in doing that, I hope when it comes back here that at least some of you have the decency to stand up and admit how wrong you were to hastily vote for a piece of legislation that had been  poorly drafted, that had been ill-thought through. The advice of security agencies had not been sought before deciding on those votes; that is on your heads. It is on your heads, not just what you proposed to do but the legacy from your government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we heard in question time today, 1,200 deaths at sea occurred under your watch when you last tried to weaken our border protection laws, 50,000 people arrived by boat when you last weakened our border protection laws, 800 boats arrived, 17 new detention centres were established and thousands of children were placed in detention, which this government have got out of detention. We've been able to get the kids out of detention and off Manus and Nauru because we put in place, first and foremost, a strong border protection regime that discourages people from getting on boats in the first place. Yet again, you have proven you have not learnt the lessons of history and that you're prepared to make the same mistakes again.</span>

Nothing can be more important than the public having confidence in ministers of a government. And what we see now is that the community, the public and the parliament have lost confidence in Minister Cash. Minister Cash argued that we shouldn't forget what this is about—another smoke screen, another whiteboard to try and disguise her involvement and the involvement of her office in the leaking of a raid on AWU offices.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a rabble of a government. It's a government with a disgraced minister in Minister Cash. This is a minister who has suffered a spectacular collapse of credibility and a minister who will not accept ministerial accountability. This is a discredited minister. Each time she stands up, she will not tell the truth. She has got contempt for the Senate, she's got contempt for parliament and she's got contempt for the people of Australia. She has got contempt for ministerial accountability. Five times she came to Senate estimates and denied there was any involvement of her staff in leaking information that the Federal Police said could have put their people in danger. She denied that on five occasions. And then what happened? She has had to come back in and concede that her staff were involved. She threw one of her junior staff under the bus. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've found out today is this was not about junior staff; this was about her chief of staff leaking information to the media, information that could have put the Federal Police, as they indicated, in danger. This is unacceptable, it's a criminal act, and it beggars belief that the DPP cannot find a way to prosecute the people who we already know were involved in this leak. And probably part of the reason they couldn't prosecute was that the minister herself has been disassembling, has been trying to cover up and has been using parliamentary privilege and the argument that the matters are before the court not to be honest and upfront with the people of Australia. This is a minister and a government with contempt for the people of Australia. The reason we are here on this is that this government has used government authorities to run their political attacks on their opponents. The Registered Organisations Commission, the ABCC and the Fair Work Ombudsman have all been engaged in this nonsense, this problem that we have with a minister who's not prepared to stand up and tell the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened when this minister was put under pressure? She attacked young women in the Leader of the Opposition's office to try and cover up, and try and divert from, what was happening in her office. She accused them of all sorts of terrible things. It's one of the most pathetic performances I've ever seen in the 11 years I've been in this place, where a minister attacks these young women in the Leader of the Opposition's office to try and cover up what her office was involved in. We've now got concessions that they breached the law, and it's not the first time this has happened. Under Minister Cash's leadership, the ABCC commissioner Nigel Hadgkiss had to resign in disgrace.</span>

This is a government that needs to go. The sooner we get to an election, the sooner this place will be a better place. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  Madam Deputy President, have you ever heard the phrase 'if you don't like what they're saying about you, change the conversation'? I have never heard the conversation changed quite so much today, during this take note session, as we've just seen from Senator Cameron. How extraordinary! You've got to feel sorry for the Labor Party; they've had a bad day. It's been a bad day when one of your members, the member for Lindsay, didn't turn up to work on a day when there's a crucial vote—she just made it, just slipped in—and when your coalition partners in the Australian Greens decide that, actually, they've changed their minds about you and they're not going to support your legislation through. When you've had a bad day like that, what's the best thing you can do? The best thing you can do is deflect. 'Look over there,' they say. That's exactly what the Labor Party have done today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a shame, because they had a bit of pep in the step and glide in the stride over late last year—but it does seem to have diminished somewhat in recent weeks. I think that maybe they were getting a little bit too comfortable, a little bit too complacent, a little bit too confident, but that's certainly not the case. You can see the turmoil that the Labor Party find themselves in, particularly over this banking royal commission that was commissioned by the Liberal-National government and announced in November 2017. There have been 68 days of hearings. There have been 130 witnesses. They've reviewed more than 10,000 submissions. Now we have 76 separate recommendations that the government has considered and will take action on—all 76. We didn't jump the gun. We didn't say, 'We're going to support everything even though we're not entirely sure what we're supporting.' We waited. We considered the report that came from Justice Hayne. We went through every single one of those recommendations, one by one, and then we made a comment on each.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the poor old Labor Party—I'm a compassionate person; I feel quite sorry for them—have gone: 'Some of those recommendations are a little bit uncomfortable. What are we going to do about default super?' Justice Hayne said there should be one single default super fund for all Australians. That doesn't sit particularly well with a Labor Party that has vested interests in the industry superannuation sector through its union affiliations. I mean, what can you do? Senator Cameron himself was a board member of an industry super fund. Senator Ketter was a board member of an industry super fund. Goodness me! The Leader of the Opposition himself was a board member of an industry super fund. How do you decouple superannuation from industrial relations, as Commissioner Hayne has suggested, while looking after your vested interests? It's a very difficult thing to do, which is why the Labor Party don't want to talk about it. They also don't want to talk about mortgage brokers. There are 27,000 individual mortgage brokers out there in Australia, and they provide over 50 per cent of the loans. Not only do they provide 50 per cent of the home loans but they are also responsible for improving competition in our banking sector, competition that is so very, very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Commissioner Hayne has made a series of recommendations, which the government has considered. Of those recommendations to do with mortgage brokers, we have said that we will adopt putting in place a best interest duty and that we will ban trail commissions and volume based bonuses on new loans, starting from July 2020, but we are not yet comfortable with the idea of banning upfront commissions. We're not yet comfortable with that because it will essentially decimate the mortgage broking industry—the 27,000 mortgage broking employees and the 17,000 broking businesses that are out there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ask the Labor Party what it is that they want to do on mortgage brokers, because they haven't actually landed on a solution yet. They've gone silent. Instead, they're saying: 'Look the other way. Look the other way.' They haven't landed on a decision about what to do with superannuation. What are they going to do about default super? What are you going to do about default super? What are you going to say to your vested interests? Are you going to say, 'Yes, you're right: we'll decouple industrial relations from superannuation from retirement incomes'? That should have been done years ago. But they can't do it because they have vested interests. Look the other way. If you don't like what they're saying about you, change the conversation, and that's exactly what the ALP have done today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  I also rise to take note of the answers from Senator Cash to questions today regarding this never-ending scandal involving her and her office over the leaking to members of the media of confidential police information regarding a police raid, something which the commissioner of the Australian Federal Police himself described as conduct that endangered the lives of his police officers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a quick refresher for those who've forgotten the detail: what this involved was a leak of police information about an imminent police raid on union offices, which was leaked to the media by a former member of Minister Cash's staff. We know that that's how it occurred because Minister Cash, eventually, under protest, confirmed to Senate estimates that the leak had come from one of her own staff members and that he had finally admitted this in the process of resigning from her office. But, of course, before we got to finding out the truth—that this leak came from a former staff member of Minister Cash—we had to sit through Minister Cash on five occasions misleading the Senate and Senate estimates by saying that no-one in her office leaked the information and that she didn't know anything about it. In fact, at the estimates hearing on 26 October 2017—and we've referred back to what she said on that occasion—she assured the Senate that she had interviewed every member of her staff when this story finally broke and asked them whether they were aware of the police raids prior to them occurring. She told the Senate that every one of her staff members had said that they did not know and that they were not aware of these raids. We learnt today, through court proceedings brought by the Australian Workers' Union, that that is actually not true. Yet again it seems that we have Senator Cash providing incorrect, false information to the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, in proceedings brought by the Australian Workers' Union, Minister Cash's former staff member, who resigned over this affair, refused to answer questions as to who informed him about the imminent police raids. The reason he gave for why he wouldn't answer those questions was very interesting. It was because he believed that he would incriminate himself. If that doesn't show illegal conduct, conduct that would potentially make him the subject of police or other legal action, I don't know what does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the truth has finally come out. Today, in evidence before the Federal Court, the former staff member of Minister Cash has identified Minister Cash's former chief of staff as the person who informed him that the raids were imminent. Let's remember, back in October 2017, the day that these raids occurred, the day that this scandal blew up, Minister Cash finally came into the Senate and Senate estimates and admitted that it had come from her office but that she had spoken to every single one of her staff members and they had assured her that they didn't know anything about these raids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now know today, through evidence given in court, that in fact the source of this information was her former chief of staff. Contrary to what she has said, it is in fact the case that other members of her staff knew about the raids and were in on the scandal. There really can only be two situations here: either Minister Cash was telling the truth at the time, and all her other staff members lied to her in saying that they did not know about these raids; or we have a former chief of staff of Minister Cash being fingered in evidence, given up in evidence by another member of the staff, and it would seem that someone has potentially lied before the court. Either of those situations is very serious and there will be definitely be more questions to answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that we know that more than one member of Senator Cash's staff knew about the raids, the obvious question is: who else knew? We have been saying for some months now that it is impossible to believe that only one member of Minister Cash's staff knew about the imminent raids and was in on the leak. We have learned today that it now involves two members, including her former chief of staff. It defies belief to think that it is confined to those two staff members and that other staff members were not involved, and perhaps even Minister Cash herself was involved in this. But of course we continue to get this refusal from Minister Cash to answer questions. She wheels out the whiteboard before estimates; she's effectively wheeled out a whiteboard again today. But I can assure her that we're not going to let this rest and there are more questions coming.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we are, after the Christmas break, in the middle of summer, where we come on the back of a January where we have recorded the hottest-ever temperatures on record: 2018, again, was one of the hottest years on record and the last five years the hottest years on record since records were kept. Here we are on the back of those horrendous disasters: bushfires in Tasmania; parts of Tasmania that have never seen fire now being burnt; the shocking floods and torrential rains in Queensland, causing so much death and destruction; a Murray-Darling Basin that is in crisis and on the brink of collapse, with a million dead fish, including 70-year-old Murray cod that have survived countless droughts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that these are not natural disasters. This is the result of a climate that is breaking down. We have to do something about it. Yet here we are, back in the parliament, with records tumbling and disasters across the country, and what has the coalition got? Nothing. More fear, more division within the community, beating up on innocent people seeking asylum, preventing them from getting the health care they need. Nothing to deal with the climate crisis that we're confronting right now. No plan to deal with coal. Eighty per cent of the coal that is dug up in this country ends up on a ship and is being burnt overseas. What is the government's plan? Indeed, what is the Labor Party's plan to deal with that coal, which is the single biggest contributor to the climate crisis we're confronting? We heard today from Minister Cormann. He gave us the drug dealer's defence: if we don't do it, someone else will. If we don't burn it, someone else will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not good enough. We know that we have to do something about the coal that we're digging up and exporting and which is being burnt overseas. That's the challenge for us. We know we've got two big parties that are beholden to their corporate donors, to their big mates in the coal industry. They are hamstrung. They will not act in the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They say the economy needs it. Well, we have an economy that is transforming before our eyes. The Asian Renewable Energy Hub right now in the Pilbara has plans to export renewable energy—solar and wind—to parts of Asia. Japan and South Korea, two of our three biggest coal customers, have put out a global tender to be supplied with hydrogen. We could be supplying renewable hydrogen to the rest of the world rather than contributing to catastrophic climate damage. We need a plan to help manufacturers cut their emissions, to strengthen their bottom line. We've got a plan. The Greens have a plan to help households install more solar panels, to increase energy storage, to ensure we get the electrification of our transport networks and to get energy efficiency and energy productivity back on track, but this government needs to listen not just to the Greens but to the community that's screaming out for a plan. It needs to listen to the voices of those young people, the school strikers, who were out there campaigning for their future, which is being ripped away from them by a government too busy doing the bidding of their big fossil fuel donors. These incredible children right across the country were saying: 'We need leadership. We need you to act because you are damaging our prospects for living in a safe and healthy climate.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate records its deep sorrow at the death, on 9 December 2018, of the Hon. Gordon Scholes, AO, a former member of the House of Representatives for the division of Corio, Speaker of the House in the Whitlam government and Minister for Defence and Minister for Territories in the Hawke government, places on record its gratitude for his service to the parliament and the nation, and extends its deepest sympathies to his family in their bereavement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hon. Gordon Scholes AO was a man of many talents and vocations: a train driver, fireman, heavyweight boxing champion, parliamentarian, Speaker, cabinet minister, family man—an impressive list stretching from the railways of Victoria through to the halls of Parliament House and the cabinet table. And, in each of those roles and throughout his entire life, Gordon served his family, his community and his country with distinction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born on 7 June 1931 to Thomas and Mary Scholes, much of Gordon's childhood was spent following his family as they moved from place to place. Before entering the political arena, Gordon found success in an entirely different arena, though perhaps not so different at all. He was so good at boxing that in 1949 he became the Victorian amateur heavyweight boxing champion. By day he worked as a railwayman for Victorian Railways from 1949 until 1967 and also served his community as a fireman and fire engine driver from 1955. Clearly, in the early years of his career he took on the two dream jobs of many boys, I'm sure, across Australia at the time—certainly during my childhood across Belgium at the time, train driver and fire engine driver sound like the sorts of jobs that any boy aspires to while growing up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some might say that politics was an unlikely path for Gordon. As one family member would later note, at the time he married his loving wife, Della Robinson, in late July 1957, life on the federal political circuit seemed a world away. However, having settled in Geelong in the 1950s, Gordon joined the Australian Labor Party in 1955 and went on to serve in a range of positions, including as president of the Labor Party's Geelong branch between 1962 and 1964 and as president of the Geelong Trades Hall college from 1965 to 1966. His foray into formal elected office began in earnest with his election as a City of Geelong councillor in 1965, a post that he held until the year of his election to the federal parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gordon was at first unsuccessful when contesting the seat of Corio. However, when long-time Liberal incumbent, Sir Hubert Opperman OBE, retired from politics a year or so later, Gordon recontested the seat, this time successfully, in the July 1967 by-election. He would go on to retain the seat at 10 subsequent elections—sometimes comfortably, at other times decidedly less so, including by a razor-thin but still winning margin of just 20 votes after the December 1975 election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his first speech, Gordon showed a keen interest in policy, touching on issues that ranged from defence industry to social services. Commendably, he spoke passionately in favour of the needs of Australia's First World War veterans, many of whom were reaching the end of their lives at the time he entered the parliament. He also displayed his keen local focus, advocating for rail infrastructure that would benefit his local electorate. It is a credit to the person and the good character of Gordon Scholes that he also took the time in his first speech to acknowledge his predecessor, commending his many years of service, just as he set about his own work for the people of Corio. Appointed as Deputy Speaker in February 1973, he served diligently in that role and was thrust quite literally into the hot seat during one of the most tumultuous periods in our nation's political history, becoming Speaker of the House of Representatives in February 1975 and remaining in that role until the defeat of the Whitlam government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Notably, he did not allow those turbulent years in Canberra to distract him from his local community. He played a key role in establishing Deakin University in 1974, an achievement that many point to as one of his most significant contributions to the city. As well as serving initially as Manager of Opposition Business in the House, Gordon became Labor's defence spokesperson during the ensuing opposition years and took on a vast portfolio faced with significant technological and political transitions in the years following the end of the Vietnam War. Ever locally minded, he was also acutely aware that the government's aircraft factories, which had played an important role in the nation's defence industry until that point, were nestled within his own electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor next formed government under then Prime Minister Bob Hawke, he retained his portfolio and ascended to what would be his most significant job in government, serving as Minister for Defence from the Hawke government's election in 1983 through to December 1984. At the time <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times </span>involved his sporting past with a clever 1983 headline declaring 'Ex-boxer retains his sure-footedness in a tricky portfolio'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gordon also served as minister leading the newly formed Department of Territories, remaining in that role until he departed the ministry in July 1987. In the years that followed he remained active within the walls of parliament and outside them, working diligently for his constituents and serving as Deputy Chairman of Committees from May 1990 through to his retirement. Choosing to retire just prior to the 1993 federal election, Gordon's final speech, made a quarter of a century after his first, made clear that over 25 years of Canberra life had not dimmed his earthy and practical approach to politics. The same man who began his parliamentary career with a focus on policy and pragmatism ended it in the same way, calling on the parliament of the day to better meet the expectations of the public and more effectively serve a changing Australia. Having been appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1993 in recognition of his lengthy service to the Australian community, he was honoured further, a decade after his retirement, with the receipt of a Centenary Medal in 2003. A keen stamp-collector in his later years, he was also appointed as an honorary member of the Geelong Philatelic Society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, it was Gordon's family that was his rock through it all. Though politics may not have been on the horizon at the time of their marriage, Gordon's wife, Dell, was a constant source of support through his parliamentary career and the 55 years of marriage that they shared before her passing. Indeed, in his valedictory speech he noted just how essential his family's support had been and expressed a depth of gratitude that I'm sure many of us in this chamber would sincerely empathise with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is to Gordon's two daughters, Kerry and Anne, and his two grandchildren, Monica and Jed, that on behalf of the Australian government and the Australian Senate I extend my sincerest condolences on the passing of a good and humble man whose service to this parliament and our nation, shaped and coloured by a busy life well lived, will not be forgotten.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  I rise on behalf of the opposition to acknowledge the passing of another member of the Labor family, the Hon. Gordon Glen Denton Scholes AO, who passed away in December 2018 at the age of 87. At the outset, I convey the opposition's condolences to relatives and friends of Mr Scholes. I particularly acknowledge in the gallery his daughters, Anne and Kerry, who have travelled to be with us here today—proud daughters of a great Labor man and a wonderful Labor parliamentarian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gordon Scholes served for 2½ decades in the Australian parliament, a period which coincided with a period of enormous economic and social change, and in many ways he came to symbolise that transition. Like Ben Chifley, he entered the parliament after a career driving trains and left the parliament having held some of the highest offices in the land. Gordon Scholes was the member for Corio in the House of Representatives from 1967 until his retirement in February 1993. Although he had contested the seat against the renowned cyclist Sir Hubert Opperman in 1966, he didn't win the seat until Oppy, as he was known, was appointed as the High Commissioner to Malta in early 1967. His campaign was strongly supported by Gough Whitlam, and the win by Mr Scholes on the back of a swing of more than 11 per cent was seen by many as the beginning of the way back for Labor after the disastrous split.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From his election until his retirement, his principal policy focus was the welfare of working-class people, who had to battle to sustain a reasonable standard of living, and this was evident in his first speech. Unlike the contemporary practice, where first speeches are often replete with noble sentiment and high aspiration, first speeches at that time addressed the more practical legislative issues of the day, yet Mr Scholes found a place in his speech on the 1967 budget—delivered, of course, in Old Parliament House—to advance his view that a primary role of the parliament was to legislate the social services that protect the nation's standard of living and to restore the economic and political liberties of the nation's First Peoples. He was an early advocate for Aboriginal rights. In his final speech—delivered in this house—Gordon Scholes again addressed the need for parliament to improve the processes that enable it to deliver on its primary function, legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gordon Scholes became Speaker of the House of Representatives in February 1975, guiding the House through the tumultuous events of November 1975 and standing down from the position in February 1976. He was also Minister for Defence in the first Hawke ministry from March 1983 until December 1984 and Minister for Territories until 1987. It was from that office that he laid the building blocks of self-government for the Australian Capital Territory. A man of integrity, humanity and humility, Mr Scholes filled each of these roles with a quiet, purposeful dignity, and although he had left the federal parliamentary Labor Party caucus almost a decade before I took my place in the Senate, his reputation was his legacy, and I am proud, as are others on this side, to belong to a great Labor tradition of which he was such a loyal and hardworking member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gordon Scholes was born into the Great Depression, the global economic disaster that affected virtually every family in this country, and his family was no exception. His father, grandfather and great-grandfather all worked for the Victorian Railways: his father as a ganger and his antecedents as station masters. Being a ganger meant his father was always on the move, and this led to Mr Scholes spending long periods of his childhood living with uncles, aunts and other family members. His disrupted family life and uneven educational opportunities meant that by the end of 1939 he had undergone little more than two years education but at five different schools. He then attended a number of Catholic schools, including St Ambrose's in Brunswick, which had the distinction of including John Curtin and BA Santamaria amongst its alumni.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the time he had finished school at age 15 he had attended some 16 schools, but he wasn't awarded the merit certificate, as it was then called, on the completion of grade 8 because he had not attended each of the previous two years continuously. He had spent several months in the children's hospital in Melbourne. Mr Scholes was determined that the same disruption would not affect his own family. He and his wife, Dell, worked together to ensure that their daughters, Kerry and Anne, enjoyed the stability, the lack of which he lamented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a short stint at the Daylesford Technical High School, he took his first job at the woollen mills. And his final exposure to the education system formally was the Ballarat School of Mines in 1948, where he did a night course in fitting and turning. But the railways were in his blood. It wasn't long before he joined the Victorian Railways to become, first of all, a locomotive fireman, shovelling some 40 tonnes of coal into the steam locomotives between Melbourne and Wodonga and finally earning his drivers ticket to achieve his childhood ambition to stand on the footplate as the driver of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Spirit of Progress</span>—well named!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gordon Scholes was a keen sportsman, a passion he pursued throughout his life. He was an Australian Rules footballer and an avid Cats supporter—but we still like him. He was a low handicapper and pennant golfer, and a king of the snooker table. He won the Parliament House championship at Old Parliament House in 1981, but I understand he was most renowned as a boxer. I'm not sure how many members of parliament have made it to the Melbourne <span style="font-style:italic;">Sporting Globe</span>, a famous, but now defunct, pink tabloid. But he did in 1949, when he won the Victorian amateur heavyweight championship. A short quote from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span> gives you the flavour of the journal: 'As soon as he felt that Green, his opponent, was anchored, Scholes started a right from behind his heels that landed in Green's dining room, I feel for Green.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Scholes had an unusual and rather vivid knowledge of world affairs that would resonate in the contemporary world of electronic media and constant visual images. During his layovers in Melbourne between driving the <span style="font-style:italic;">Spirit of Progress</span> down from Wodonga then back up again, he would sit in the old Century Newsreel Theatre in Swanston Street or the Tatler Newsreels Theatrette in the basement of the Australia Hotel in Collins Street watching Movietone newsreels—no bars, but rather continuous self-improvement, and his memory for detail was amazing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While stationed in Wodonga, Gordon Scholes joined our party, the Australian Labor Party. He had been active in the AFULE, the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Employees, the world's oldest railway union, founded in 1861. Moving to Geelong in the late 1950s, he joined the local branch and then, as an AFULE member, became a delegate to the Geelong Trades Hall Council. He was vice-president from 1964 and President from 1965 to 1967.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His path to federal politics began in the early 1960s with a local issue—the survival of a kindergarten. Even though they hadn't funded it, the local council, controlled by the conservatives at the time, decided to close it down anyway. They ignored the pleas of the local community, but they hadn't reckoned with Gordon Scholes. They reversed their decision, he was elected to council and, two years later to the day, he was elected as the federal member for Corio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliamentary career of Gordon Scholes was one of dogged determination; a determination to represent his electors and to anchor, to the best of his ability, a stable and progressive Labor government. That became increasingly trickier as 1975 unfolded, though his steady hand on the tiller of the Speakership certainly protected the dignity and proper functioning of the House of Representatives. The terrible events of 11 November 1975 have been recorded many times and I don't propose to rehearse them today; suffice to say Mr Scholes could never bring himself to forgive the profound discourtesy shown by the then Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, to the parliament. Kerr pointedly refused to meet the Speaker when Mr Scholes called on him to inform him that the person whom he had appointed behind the back of the elected Prime Minister had lost the confidence of the House and, hence, had no right to advise an election. He was kept waiting for over an hour, during which time the writs were issued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first Hawke government, Mr Scholes was a diligent and hardworking minister, serious to the point of diffidence. His proudest achievement, in many ways, was to have persuaded Whitlam to establish Deakin University, which transformed Geelong into a university town, allowing local students to attend university close to home rather than having to board in Melbourne to attend Melbourne, Monash, RMIT or Swinburne. I also am advised that, in his life after politics, he was an avid stamp collector and a recognised expert on what are known as 'Australian colonial covers' and what are known as 'half lengths', which those who have his interest and knowledge of the philatelic world will know is impressive. It's a kind of historical echo which, in his understated way, Mr Scholes particularly enjoyed. Following his retirement, he remained active in our party, mentoring a number of aspiring politicians at both the state and the federal level. Of course, he was a devoted family man, showering his family with the love, affection and stability that may have been absent for some of his own peripatetic childhood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gordon Scholes was an honourable man. He had an abiding care for people, especially those who were down on their luck. He knew what hardship was like and he worked tirelessly for the betterment of working people and their families. Paul Keating summed up his career succinctly when he said, on the last sitting day of 1992, that Mr Scholes had acquitted himself 'with great dignity, thoughtfully and carefully'. Dignity, thoughtfulness and care make a fine epitaph for a fine man. I again express our sympathy to his family and friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Question agreed to, honourable senators standing in their places.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate records its deep sorrow at the death on, 9 February 2019, of Mr Bernard (Barney) Cooney, a former senator for Victoria, places on record its gratitude for his long service to the Parliament and the nation, and extends its sincere sympathies to his family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Spanning 17 years, Barney Cooney's time in the Senate was marked by a decency and collegiality that earned him the respect of those on all sides of the Senate chamber. He was born on 11 July 1934 to Bernard, whose name he took, and Constance, or 'Corrie', Cooney on Tasmania's King Island into a family whose Irish heritage in Tasmania stretched back to the 1820s. However, much of his childhood was spent moving through towns dotted across regional Victoria—Culgoa, Gunbower and Yarck among them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the family of a bank branch manager, Barney's family was spared the full pain of the Great Depression, but in his youth he witnessed some of the social toll that it imposed on others. His formative years were spent watching impoverished itinerant men, many of them veterans of the First World War, visiting his home for help. His mother's generosity in giving them food and, where she could, the dignity of work had a profound and lasting impact on his social conscience. In time, Barney's family moved to the city and ran a milk bar in South Melbourne. Following his father's passing in 1951, Barney's mother continued to run the family business, with the help of her children, until her own passing in 1968.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite losing his father at a young age, Barney excelled at St Kevin's Christian Brothers college and secured a scholarship that saw him take up studies in arts and law at the University of Melbourne. While there, he fully engaged in university life: completing his national service, representing his campus as a boxer—another one; there's a theme here—and joining the university's ALP Club, later joining the St Kilda branch of the ALP. Barney refused to allow the sectarian tensions that had so riven his party through the 1950s and 1960s to colour his time within its ranks. He was well known for his dual commitment to the Labor cause and to his Catholic faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once armed with his Bachelor of Law, Barney was admitted to the Victorian Bar in 1961. His work centred on the personal injury and industrial law spaces and spanned two decades prior to his election to parliament. Notably, his legal activities didn't end when he came to Canberra, and he remained on the bar roll throughout his time in this place. I should note that his legal career brought him more than just a livelihood, because in April 1962 he married Lillian Gill, a fellow lawyer, with whom he would have five children, one of whom they tragically lost in infancy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 December 1984, Barney was elected to represent the state of Victoria in the Senate, which was the beginning of 17 years in an office that he took very seriously indeed, and in a chamber whose role in checking and reviewing government he held in high regard. Indeed, his concerns about executive overreach, articulated passionately in his first speech, were a defining feature of his parliamentary service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A Westminster traditionalist, nowhere did his belief in the Senate's crucial democratic function come through more strongly than in his approach to the Senate committee system. As a prolific committee contributor, he chaired seven Senate committees and participated in a formidable 25 parliamentary committees in total. Those roles gave him insight into a wide range of issues and topics, from animal welfare to telecommunications through to law and order and much more. Among the committees that he chaired were the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. However, in line with his convictions, some of Barney's most famous contributions were those that he made on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, of which he was regarded by many to have been one of the most outstanding chairs ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His emphasis on liberty often stirred him to action, sometimes even against his own party, as was seen in his vigorous critique of the Hawke government's proposed national identity card legislation. Yet, whatever the disagreements he may have had, Barney was widely known to be a man of geniality and good humour. Indeed, when one looks back through the commentary of his contemporaries, the high regard in which he was held comes through very clearly. Barney regularly spoke about the importance of civility in politics, and no-one could doubt that he met the high bar that he so regularly set. It is a tribute to his character that, at the time of his retirement, so many senators lined up across partisan lines to farewell their departing friend. My good friend and former Liberal senator for South Australia Alan Ferguson captured the sentiment very well:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Everybody knows Senator Cooney because he is the most gracious man who greets every new member and makes them feel so much at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his own valedictory speech, Barney displayed that same grace. Rather than focus on himself, he turned the chamber's attention to the work of his staff, friends and colleagues. So plentiful was his list of thankyous that to be safe he conceded that the only way to ensure that he wouldn't miss anyone was to table the entire phone book!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Though he retired from the parliament in 2002, Barney's passion for life and politics was undimmed. In 2003 he was named patron of the Conciliation Assistants Representing Employees Group, and in 2005 he was appointed chair of the advisory group to the Elder Abuse Prevention Project established by the Victorian government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As he battled ill health in his later life, he kept busy. Indeed, he was politically involved to the very end and attended meetings just last month. I commend in particular his deep commitment to community service, which saw him provide pro bono legal support even in retirement. With his lengthy service to the community now having come to an end, Barney leaves behind his loving wife, Lillian, their four children and their grandchildren. As they mourn the loss of their husband and father, the Senate mourns the loss of a kind, decent and committed public servant. On behalf of the Australian government and the Australian Senate, I extend to Barney's loved ones our sincerest condolences.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="AW5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KIM CARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  On behalf of the opposition, I would like to convey our condolences to Barney Cooney's family. I had the great pleasure of knowing Barney over many, many years. I offer these remarks in the context of that knowledge and will concentrate on the areas of work that we did together. I don't want to take away from the work that he did in so many other areas. It's the nature of these types of discussions that one invariably concentrates on aspects of people's lives and, without meaning to, neglects so many other areas of their lives that are very, very important. I don't often contribute in condolence debates, so this is a particular exception. Because of the nature of Barney's contribution, I made a particular point of seeking to make this representation to the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barney was a prominent member of the generation of Labor politicians who, I think, played a critical role in casting off the legacies of the 1950s split in the Labor Party. He joined the Labor Party in 1964. He was in fact made a life member in 2004. His contribution and that of his generation were that they paved the way for the return of the Labor Party to power, nationally under Gough Whitlam and in Victoria under John Cain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barney was also a very proud member of the Socialist Left in Victoria. Some people regarded this as ironic. I never did. He was at heart a democratic socialist who upheld core Labor values, but he was also deeply religious. He remained a devout Catholic throughout his life. And Barney himself saw no contradiction between his faith and his politics. Many people once saw that there was this fundamental gap. I trust that few do today. The fact that they have seen this change is a legacy of the work that people like Barney undertook—that is, to overcome the sectarian nature of the split. Those who thought that way of Barney's belief paradoxically failed to grasp that there are more paths to a vision of a better Australia than those shared by those of the doctrinaire views of the Left. You don't have to be a card-carrying member of the atheist brigade to appreciate the fact that tolerance and respect for others are not confined to one particular variety of views.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many on the Left have thought that bigotry was the preserve of the churches. It's not. It can be found in many groups of people who adopt a very blinkered view of the way in which the world works. Barney was one of those people who are able to encounter that blinkered view and overcome it. I think it was because of the way in which he was able to interact with people that he was able to get on so well with people of so many different strands of thought. People like him, Catholics who remained in the Labor Party rather than joining the DLP—Arthur Calwell might be thought of as another—endured a hostility not just within sections of the labour movement but within the church itself. It was in large part because of the example set by people like Barney that they were able to overcome old animosities and consign that view to the past. The golden thread, as I saw it, in Barney's work was his commitment to social justice and the defence of working people—and Senator Cormann outlined that in his contribution today. From the very time Barney entered university, it became consistent with his understanding of the Catholic faith; indeed, it may well be argued that it arose from it. He believed that all people had an inherent dignity because, as he would put it, they were made in the image of his god.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barney never chose to wear his religion on his sleeve, but it is important, if you are to understand his politics, to understand his deep religious conviction. For Barney, the implications of this belief were absolutely clear. He was never afraid to stand with those that had been socially ostracised or those that had been consigned to the margins of society, and that included some in the industrial wing of the labour movement whose militancy and fondness for plain speaking did not always endear them to others in the Labor Party, let alone to conservatives. These were people that were unashamedly Barney's comrades. They were his close friends: people like Wally Curran, the secretary of the meatworkers union, for instance, with whom he had a very, very close personal relationship. There were people like Tom Ryan, the long-serving secretary of the Food Preservers' Union—people like Peter Marshall, secretary of the firefighters union.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if he had never served in this chamber, Barney would be remembered as a great defender of the union movement and as an advocate for workers' rights. That's evident not only in his cases as a lawyer but in his working with people like Graham Bird from the meatworkers union or Jenny Doran from the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Barney chaired an inquiry into workers compensation, and that work led to a comprehensive overhaul of the workers comp laws in the state of Victoria. That report—along with a fair bit of political struggle, I might add—became the basis of the present WorkCover system in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barney was widely respected across the labour movement, and I mean widely respected across the labour movement, for a combination of these qualities. And, of course, these are the same qualities that made him stand out in this chamber. He was conspicuous for his grace as well as for his courage, for his courtesy and his generosity of spirit, and that was shown to all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late in his time here, he wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Courtesy and grace are forever needed in debate. A civil society cannot be at its best unless its constituents treat each other civilly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That Barney lived this prescription was acknowledged by those who reported on this parliament and by those who served in it. Alex Kirk, the ABC journalist, described him as a man 'who never descends into vitriol, who bears no grudges and doesn't say a bad word about anyone'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators on the other side of the chamber tended to agree. Amanda Vanstone, who was noted, I think, for her ability to come up with a quick barb, seemed in an interview with Alex Kirk to have a soft spot for Barney. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think the real reason is all of us in Parliament have got a mixture of politician and parliamentarian, and Barney's got the highest portion of the latter that I've come across.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barney's courtesy and respect for others was learned early in life, and these points have been made. He was born on King Island in Tasmania with his father, Bernard, a branch manager for the Commercial Bank. The family's Irish forebears were connected in Tasmania dating back to the 1820s, and in 1937 they were transferred through to the Mallee in western Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this period, points have been made. I think that Senator Cormann drew upon the notes that were distributed on this matter. In the wake of the Depression there were still many, many people wandering the back roads of the Mallee, and they'd often visit the family home asking for food. Barney's political awakening was found in this experience. He said that the courtesy and kindness shown to the itinerant men by his mother, Corrie, formed a lasting impression on him. In this interview with Alex Kirk, he remembered it this way:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They'd come to the door, knock on the door, and ask for something to eat and something to drink. The sort of thing, I suppose, that Henry Lawson used to describe in his story. She would always give them work if she could, chopping the wood, that gave them dignity and she'd always give them supper, no matter who they were, because they were human beings and in many cases they were return soldiers from World War I and many of the younger ones were going to be soldiers in World War II. That was always a lesson to me, that no matter who you were, you were entitled to be treated in a particular way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cooney family later moved to the city, and they ran a milk bar in South Melbourne. Upon Barney's father's death, Corrie kept up the business until her own death in 1968.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barney attended St Kevin's College from 1947 through to '52, and he won a Commonwealth scholarship—I think that's important: he actually won a Commonwealth scholarship—to study arts and law at the University of Melbourne, where he did his national service and took up boxing. Active in undergraduate life, he was particularly active in the ALP Club and the Newman Society. Barney was admitted to the bar in 1961. He remained on the bar roll throughout his political career and after his retirement from politics, when he continued to do pro bono work. I can tell you there were many people who simply could not afford a lawyer who turned to him and received that legal assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Within the Victorian ALP, Barney was originally a member of what was known as the Participants, which became the Independent faction after the intervention in the Victorian branch by the ALP federal executive in 1970. The Independents came to hold the balance of power between the Left and the Right in the 1970s, including many who were associated with Labor's return to power: John Button, John Cain, Michael Duffy and Richard McGarvie. Barney was elected to the ALP state Administrative Committee as an Independent, but didn't stay that long with that faction. He joined the Socialist Left in 1994, and, of course, remained with that to his death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was by then a member of the Senate. He was elected in 1985, with a No. 3 on the ticket. He actually had been selected on the Socialist Left spot on the ticket. It's a measure of the high regard in which he was held that he won preselection after an intense battle between two leading members of the Left, Bruce Hartnett and Bill Hartley. Each of them was vying for that spot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barney was a widely-welcomed compromise candidate—I say that in the very best sense of the term. At the time of his election he was 50. He came equipped with more than 20 years experience resolving workers' legal problems. In his first speech, Barney quoted the often abused term from Lord Acton, the famous dictum of 'power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely'. He turned that on its head and he said: 'If power corrupts, then the lack of power corrodes absolutely.' Barney said that those in Australia who lack power to give at least minimum expression to their needs included Indigenous people, the unemployed and the non-English speaking migrants, especially women:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The more they can be effectively equipped with power the more likely it is that their social distress will be abated and the community as a whole benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From that fundamental commitment, he never wavered in the 17 years he was in this chamber. I think he regarded this Senate as actually the best place to check the abuses of power, particularly because of this chamber's committee system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barney chaired seven committees, and he's best remembered for his outstanding work on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. We should all remember that that committee's primary function is to guard against legislation which would trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, and that, of course, reflected his own deepest personal instincts. Barney was not afraid, however, to criticise people in authority, even in the Labor Party—particularly when he felt they'd transgressed on those fundamental principles. In caucus, he opposed the Hawke government's proposed national identity card, which he described publicly as an Orwellian measure. He said, 'You should never need a licence to be a citizen.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During his final years in the Senate, Barney was greatly disturbed by the increasing amount of legislation under the Howard government, particularly on asylum seekers and on measures against terrorism, that he regarded as curbing the rights of the individual. Speaking on various antiterrorism measures, he warned:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">What happens with legislation is that it creeps. You cannot look at legislation simply in terms of what is happening now, you have to look at what might happen later on. Once you proscribe an organisation, people say 'that's how things are done'. What was put in as an exception originally becomes the precedent for more and more power to be given to the executive, and that is a real problem.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barney was so well regarded across this parliament. I think that will become apparent if others speak on this matter, but there is ample evidence of that. He was noted for his loyalty, not just to his caucus colleagues but particularly to staff. I want to emphasise this point. Many people who worked on this side of the chamber and who are now quite senior politicians have said to me that his courtesy, in terms of the way he treated individual staff members and officials of this parliament, has to be acknowledged. I must say: all too often in this place we hear of examples where members of this parliament fail to fulfil their obligations in that regard. During his valedictory speech, as has already been indicated, he made the point of tabling the phone directory in case he forgot anybody.</span>

He would spend a good deal of time rewriting the question in such a manner as to congratulate the minister who was under attack, somewhat weakening the thrust of our criticism and, of course, making it more difficult for others to press the attack. It didn't impress the hard men of the Senate, I can assure you. He remained, however, undaunted by their remarks and was quite happy not to get any more questions, I might say!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barney remained politically active long after his retirement and even in his final illness. He was grievously ill for a very long time. While his body deteriorated, his mind did not. He was a member of the Trades Hall Council and Literary Institute, which is a committee of management that actually runs the grants for the Trades Hall Council in Melbourne. He attended meetings in late January this year. He attended union Christmas parties before Christmas, and I think many people were shocked to see the physical deterioration that had occurred.</span>

Australian public life, and this chamber especially, are the richer for his contribution. I once again pass on the opposition's condolences to his family. I know senators will join me in offering those condolences to his wife, Lillian, and their surviving children.</span>

I think Senator Cormann used the words 'decency' and 'collegiality', and that was certainly my recollection of Barney. He had a wry smile and a wicked, if very quiet, sense of humour. I'm surprised to hear today, for the first time, that he was a boxer, because his gentleness, his graciousness and his courtesy in the chamber would make one struggle to believe that he was a prize-fighter.</span>

He was a wonderful and very, very fine man. I was interested to see in a paper that Senator Carr must have written some time ago about Barney Cooney that Barney used to oppose things in caucus regularly, and I can accept that that would be correct. He was a fairly independent thinker in the time that I knew him. He certainly had a very, very bright mind, and I can imagine that he would've been a very competent and successful barrister. I just wanted to, as I say, associate myself with the condolence motion and to include my condolences to his family and friends.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  Many kind things have already been said about Barney Cooney, and I wish to associate myself with all of those comments, particularly the very considered and thoughtful comments by my friend Senator Carr in relation to Barney, who we both knew very well over a long period of time. I wasn't here to work with Barney in this place—in fact, I replaced Barney after his retirement in 2002—but I have certainly enjoyed some of the reflected glory of his legacy in this place.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would like to do is say a number of words on behalf of his children, who have contacted me, in the very place where their father so eloquently contributed to some of the great debates of this nation. It's a great honour to do so on their behalf. They say:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Dad died peacefully in his sleep on Saturday, 9 February 2019. His sister Jane was by his side which was fitting as she was there at his birth and was reading traditional Irish stories to him just before he passed. Although most of dad's mainly Irish forebears lived in Tasmania for several generations, one dating back to the 1820s, Dad still lived the old Irish stories.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Barney spent the last couple of years of his life in an aged care centre. One of the carers at the centre told the family that Barney never spoke about himself. But Barney knew the names of every carer and always knew something about them or their families. That's typical of Barney, his whole life was spent thinking about the wellbeing of others before his own. Even when things weren't going great for him as the final couple of years were not easy for him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Dad was a creature of habit and would go to the same stores at the Victoria market every time he went there. He'd always chat to the storeowners about how they were going, how their families were going and the state of their businesses. It always put a smile on their face every time he would turn up to their stores. Dad hasn't been able to get to the Victoria market for a while now and it appears that we have inherited the same habits as Dad as we go to the same shops as he used to go to. Although he hasn't been there for a few years now they still ask after him every time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Just before Christmas in 2018, we took dad and mum to Anglesea, a rare visit for them in recent times. Mum and dad used to take us there all the time when we were growing up. Running and swimming on the beach, having the traditional Australian barbeques and bush walks. They were great times that dad's children, Sean, Justin, Megan and Jerome will never forget. Dad and mum, and their children would've loved for the youngest sibling, Geraldine, to be there, also.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Barney's grandchildren have this to say about him: Granddad was a great man. His tenacious upholding of personal values is inspiring to us. However, nothing defined his character more than his unique ability to provide unconditional love and kindness to those close to him. Demonstrative of this he used to come and watch the grandkids swimming each week at Melbourne University. This became increasingly difficult for him but he'd turn up each week and take the grandkids for donuts and muffins afterwards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Dad played footy in his youth, and loved South Melbourne where he grew up as a teenager. However, when they moved to Sydney and transformed into the flashy Sydney Swans complete with dancing girls this was too much for him. Dad decided to support a local club so he changed allegiances to Fitzroy. Like the old South Melbourne, Fitzroy were not team that featured often in the finals. Soon after, Fitzroy moved to Brisbane and became the Brisbane Lions. After that Dad gave up supporting a club. Some say it was a matter of principle for him that he couldn't support a team that was not local but we think it was more to do with the success the Brisbane Lions had winning back to back grand finals which didn't sit well with his support for the underdogs on and off the field.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We've heard a lot about dad's principles and decency and kindness, but dad was also a practical man. In September 1987, dad trekked out to Waverley Park with this family to watch the VFL Preliminary Final between Hawthorn and Melbourne. This match has gone down in history due to a rare error from the great Melbourne Irish import, Jim Stynes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The final moments of the game went something like this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Gary Buckenara from Hawthorn received a free kick, 55 metres out. Although a good kick, 55 metres was probably beyond him. The siren went. Game over. Except for the crowd waiting for the free kick. He lined up, the crowded stadium on the edge of their seats. Buckenara needed to kick the goal for Hawthorn to win. Then, in one of the great moments in finals history, Jim Stynes accidently gave away a 15 metres penalty which put Buckenara 40 metres out. It was Hawthorn—and not Melbourne—that advanced to the Grand Final that year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And where was Barney and his family when this historic drama unfolded .... they were already in the car headed back home as dad wanted to leave early to beat the traffic.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barney was a thoroughly decent human being and a credit to the labour movement and to this place. He never abandoned his humanity or his sense of obligation to those less fortunate and less powerful during his 18 years in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his maiden speech, Barney said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Power corrupts; lack of power corrodes absolutely. People who are powerless to give at least minimum expression to their needs are at risk of being rendered hopeless, desperate, alienated, physically ill, mentally ill, or a combination of two or more of those things.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barney never forgot those people in his time here. He was never afraid to speak his mind or to stand up for what he believed in, but he always did so with courtesy and dignity and was a man always willing to extend the hand of friendship across the aisle, and that has been reflected in the very kind and heartfelt tributes extended to him from former colleagues across the political spectrum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  I rise this afternoon to support this condolence motion and pay my respects to the late Victorian Labor senator Bernard Cooney, or Barney, as everyone knew him. I wasn't fortunate enough to know the senator personally. What I do know is his reputation—a reputation that few enjoy and that many aspire to on all sides of politics. It's this legacy and some urging from those who knew him well that has compelled me to speak today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a believer in the need for us all to work towards raising the standard of civility in this place, and one way to do it is to acknowledge the strengths of those across the aisle. Much has been said about Senator Cooney's decades-long legal career before he took up office in 1985 and the pro bono work he took up after his retirement in 2002. Much has been made, and rightfully so, of his outstanding committee work, for he was a master of the committee system. He was well respected as a chair. Committee work played to his strengths, his humanity and his decency. He could set people at ease and foster reasonableness, preferring a much more informal style of discussion than the combat of the chamber. As Amanda Vanstone once said of him: 'Why wouldn't you be happy to take questions from a decent person who always frames them decently and is genuinely interested in the answer? He asks the question pleasantly, he's never personally abusive and he's genuinely interested in the answer, so of course you'd show him respect.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was most celebrated for his work as Chair of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. Speaking on the role of the committee, he said, 'Legislation is often passed which unintentionally imposes quite severely upon the sort of life we like to live. It's proper that there should be a committee of all parties who sit down and look at it and scrutinise it and make sure that those sorts of liberties that we all enjoy are not in any way diminished.' It's a sentiment I share. It was a deep commitment to protecting civil liberties that defined Senator Cooney's parliamentary career, most notably when he criticised the Hawke government's proposed national identity card as an Orwellian measure. He was a person of principle and conviction. He wasn't afraid to criticise the Liberal Party or, indeed, his own party, when he saw that individual freedom was in jeopardy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been noted, he was a deeply religious man. In the debate on voluntary euthanasia, to which he was staunchly opposed, he unashamedly invoked his Catholic faith. He didn't argue that it went against his religion; rather, he had a way of linking the religious, cultural and social beliefs that reject euthanasia, and he pointed out that they are held by a large proportion of Australian citizens, including him. He said, 'A person's stance on a particular matter should not be labelled invalid simply because it is based on his or her faith.' That still rings true today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to his unwavering belief in the Senate's role in legislative oversight, he said of the so-called Andrews bill, 'Where the state chooses to give sanction to killing, and where we as legislators approve of that, then there is a sea change in the sort of society we legislate for. Legislative creep is a common occurrence.' It was a refrain he would draw upon again when he opposed antiterror and asylum seeker legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cooney was a loyal and dedicated party man who at the same time drew respect from all sides of politics for his diplomacy. He was able to form friendships with people who held very different views to his. In his last week in the Senate, Liberal senator and government leader at the time Robert Hill called him 'one of the really decent senators within the ALP'. Australian Democrats Senator Vicki Bourne sought special leave to draw attention to his chairmanship of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, and Liberal senator Rod Kemp said that no-one had done more to raise standards than Cooney and praised him for welcoming him as a new senator when others had not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cooney seemed to return this affection in spades. In his valedictory speech, he spoke generously not just of his family and grandchildren but also of his colleagues—so much so that he tabled the entire directory for the 40th parliament to pay tribute to every person in the chamber. That's how much he genuinely valued everyone he came across in his 17 years in the Senate. It showed again what a gentleman he was and why he was so well liked by all. It is a testament to Senator Cooney's reputation that, after his retirement, newcomers to the Senate sought out his wisdom on parliamentary matters. He was also a much-valued participant in university courses on parliamentary practices and conduct. I'm glad to be able to stand here and contribute something to recognising his qualities. I don't stand on the same side of the chamber as he did, but I have no doubt that he would have treated my colleagues and me with the same respect that he afforded everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it's a little sad that I didn't get to share the chamber with him and witness his unique wit firsthand. I'm told we shared a love of books and that he read widely in history and enjoyed the Shakespearean comedies in particular. It's no surprise to those who knew him that his favourite play was <span style="font-style:italic;">Twelfth Night</span>. His was a humour and style that, to this day, stands out in this chamber's long history. As <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age </span>said for the departing senator back in 2002, 'So long, and thanks for all the quips.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  Barney Cooney was indeed a great man. I was very saddened to hear of his passing, and I'd like to indicate my appreciation to Senator Carr for his very comprehensive coverage of Barney Cooney's career not only in this place but well beyond this place, both before and after his presence here. I was recently described as being in the twilight of my political career, and it's caused me to reflect on who shared their time with Barney: Senator Carr, me, Senator Macdonald and Senator Abetz. I think that's it—just the four of us who can reflect on the day-to-day experience we had in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, it was arriving as a young pregnant woman in a chamber that had very few other women. Barney showed me the civility that has been characterised today in spades. Barney was a very good resource for our new senators. His generosity and his kindness extended into the time he shared with helping new senators understand this place and understand how to most effectively extend our resources, not only as individual senators but as a team. I'd like to think that, from some of my early time with Barney, I acquired the capacity to further develop the Senate committee system through my years, mostly in opposition, in a way that has enabled Labor senators to use opposition in a way that best serves the Australian public at large and is relatively unique to the Australian political system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I only wanted to say these few words because Senator Carr has covered Barney's participation within the Socialist Left of the party. The goodwill towards Barney was shared not only by all members of the Labor Party but by all members of this Senate. Thank you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeSpeech">The PRESIDENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  I'm going to take this opportunity to make a few brief comments on this myself and to associate myself with comments made about Senator Cooney, particularly by those who knew him. I attended the same school as Senator Cooney. To complete a reference by Senator Wong about Mr Scholes earlier, it happened also to be the same high school of BA Santamaria and 'Diamond Jim' McClelland, albeit at slightly different times for all of us. I met him in my final year, when he addressed our year level and spoke to our politics class. Already interested in politics, I was pretty obviously leaning the other way, but Senator Cooney went to a great deal of trouble to outline not just what he did but why it was important and what motivated him—as Senator Carr outlined, in particular, his faith and his care for those less privileged than others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His passion for politics was apparent not just for combat but for values and the outcomes for those he believed he was fighting for. He was proud to be a senator. Indeed, he was a proud member of the Labor Party, but he was proud to be a senator in particular and a legislator first. He represented a Senate that sometimes seemed a little bit more distant than it used to, one that placed an extraordinarily high value on the role of this place—what dedicated individuals can do with hard work, a sense of cooperation and a willingness to compromise and work to find common ground with others who want to achieve some sort of result. As others have highlighted, he believed in civil discourse and debate and in decency in its broadest sense in public life. I won't repeat what has been said by other senators this afternoon other than to say there is rarely such agreement about a member of this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met him again in the early 1990s, when I came to work in this place. I think the quote from former senator Alan Ferguson that he was 'constantly courteous', which Senator Cormann referred to, is particularly apt. When I first came to this place many years later as a senator, he was one of those people who was mentioned to me by trusted elders, both officials and senators, as someone that could be a role model for those coming to this place, in the tradition on my side of people like Senator Alan Missen. That is as true today as it was then.</span>
              </p>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of the Ministers of State (Checks for Security Purposes) Bill 2019 is to ensure that the Prime Minister is fully informed of any security issues that may arise from the personal background and circumstances of persons who have been appointed as Ministers of State including Assistant Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ministers of State occupy positions of the highest trust within the Australian Government. Cabinet Ministers are privy to the most sensitive decisions and information, including the highest levels of national security classified information. Other Ministers, Assistant Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries also have routine access to highly sensitive information including national security information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ministers of State are currently exempt from the security checking and clearance processes that apply to all Australian Government personnel who are allowed access to sensitive and security classified government information. Security checking and clearance requirements apply to the staff of Ministers, but not to Ministers themselves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill seeks to strengthen security at the highest levels of the Australian Government. While avoiding subjecting Ministers to a security clearance process that would override the Prime Minister's independent decisions on Ministerial appointments, the Bill will ensure that the Prime Minister has access to relevant security information relating to Ministers of State. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Security information relating to Ministers, conveyed in the form of reports by the Director-General of Security, will provide the Prime Minister with confidence that comprehensive checks have been made to identify any possible security issues that might affect a Minister's ability to perform their duties including maintaining Cabinet confidentiality and protecting other sensitive and national security classified information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the event that security background checks reveal an issue of security concern, the Prime Minister will be free to determine what steps might be required to resolve the matter. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Implementation of such a scheme would address a significant gap in Australia's Protective Security Framework. In this the Bill supports the objectives of recent legislation relating to espionage and foreign interference in Australia and will provide the Parliament and the Australian public greater assurance that security will be maintained at the highest levels of the Australian Government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current Australian Protective Security Policy Framework observes that "access to sensitive and security classified information necessitates a high level of assurance of a person's integrity. This is due to the potential harm associated with compromise of that information." </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A key component of Australian Government protective security arrangements is the requirement that persons with ongoing access to sensitive or security classified information or material must be security cleared at an appropriate level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Negative Vetting Level 2 checking includes verification of identity, confirmation of Australian citizenship and status of any other citizenships, a background check covering residences, employment and other personal details over the previous 10 years, an official secrets declaration and a statutory declaration covering the provision of information, referee checks, a digital footprint check, a national police records check, a comprehensive financial statement and financial history check, a security assessment ASIO, and a security interview. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Positive Vetting includes the same checks as Negative Vetting Level 2 with the addition of a background check covering more than 10 years from the age of 16, additional financial checking with supporting documentation, a financial probity check, and a psychological assessment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The security clearance process, applied to many thousands of Australian public servants, Australian Defence Force personnel, law enforcement personnel, government contractors and state and territory government personnel whose duties require access to sensitive or national security classified Australian Government information is an essential foundation for the Australian Government's protective security framework including the investigation of foreign espionage and interference activities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is also the case, however, that the current Australian Protective Security Policy Framework identifies certain Australian office holders who are <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> required to hold a security clearance to access security classified information while exercising the duties of their office. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These office holders include Members and Senators of the Commonwealth Parliament and members of the Federal Executive Council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this policy Ministers of State are excluded from security clearance requirements by virtue of their status as Members of Parliament and as members of the Federal Executive Council. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The exemption from security clearances for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries was first publicly acknowledged in answers given by the then Attorney-General, the Hon Daryl Williams MP, to questions on notice asked in the House of Representatives in 2002. However no explanation was given for this policy which appears to date back to the beginning of the Australian Government's security clearance system in the 1940s. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Minister of State, it appears, have always been taken on trust. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current Australian Protective Security Policy Framework advances no reasons to support this policy. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In contrast the Government of Canada conducts security background checks in relation to Federal Ministers. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This policy was introduced by the Conservative Government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper in a context of concerns about foreign espionage and interference in Canada. The policy has continued under the Liberal Government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. This policy appears to be broadly accepted as compatible with longstanding ministerial and parliamentary conventions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Canadian Privy Council Office (the secretariat of the federal Cabinet of Canada) arranges for security background checks to be conducted in relation to Members of Parliament who are being considered by the Prime Minister for appointment as Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Privy Council Office has indicated that the security background checking process entails records checks with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, a check with the Canada Revenue Agency regarding tax compliance, and a check with the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy regarding bankruptcy and insolvency. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Prospective Canadian Government Ministers are required to provide the Privy Council Office with extensive personal information including financial disclosures. Security interviews are also conducted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The arrangements for security checking Canadian Ministers are informal and ultimately at the discretion of the Prime Minister. In 2015 Prime Minister Harper directed that Ministerial security checks be renewed every two years. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Canadian security practice highlights how it is highly anomalous that Australian Ministers of State, office holders who participate in the highest levels of executive government decision making and who have access to some of the most sensitive and highly classified government information, should be exempt from a mandatory security background checking process. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recent experience concerning non-compliance by Members of Parliament with constitutional requirements for election to the Commonwealth Parliament show that party preselection processes, electoral and media scrutiny as well as selection to serve in the Ministry cannot be relied on to identify and resolve matters that would be an issue in a security background checking process. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Instances of corruption involving Australian political figures including Ministers and Members of Parliament at the State and Federal levels show that Ministers may succumb to temptations that may make them vulnerable to compromise. Over the past decade issues have also arisen relating to the involvement of Members of Parliament including Ministers and Shadow Ministers with foreign persons and organisations that have raised security issues. There are numerous examples in a range of overseas jurisdictions of parliamentarians, including Ministers, who have been compromised by foreign intelligence services or have otherwise engaged in activities highly prejudicial to the national security of their country. It would be naïve to think the Australian Ministers of State will always be immune from such failings. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recognising the special position of democratically elected Members of Parliament, this Bill provides for the establishment of a mandatory security background checking process to provide information to the Prime Minister and thereby ensure that the Prime Minister is fully informed of any security issues that may arise from the personal background and circumstances of persons who have been appointed as Ministers of State. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The preparation of reports on security matters would not constitute a security clearance in the form of those applied to Australian Government personnel and other persons under the Australian Protective Security Policy Framework and would not constitute a security assessment made under Part IV of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 </span>(ASIO Act). </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Rather, reports would be available solely for the confidential information of the Prime Minister who would be free to respond however he or she considered appropriate.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill proposes that reports relating to security will be prepared by the Director-General of Security, rather than another agency such as the Australian Government Security Vetting Agency which provides centralised vetting services for most government departments and agencies. This is most appropriate given the particular sensitivity of this task and the statutory provisions that govern the independent and apolitical work of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. </span>

A Prime Minister may or may not choose to seek such advice <span style="font-style:italic;">prior</span> to recommending a person to the Governor-General for appointment as a Minister of State. This will remain a matter for the discretion of the Prime Minister. It should also be recognised that the formation of a new Ministry and the appointment of new Ministers may take place very quickly and that time may not be available for any consultation between the Prime Minister and the Director-General of Security concerning any security issues relating to possible ministerial appointees. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will establish a mandatory requirement for the Prime Minister to direct the Director-General of Security to provide reports on matters relating to security that arise from examination of the personal background and circumstances of persons appointed as Ministers of State. The Prime Minister will be obliged to issue such directions within 14 days of the appointment of a Minister (and from the commencement of the Act) and the Director-General will be required to furnish a report to the Prime Minister within 120 days. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill requires the Director-General to obtain information and undertake inquiries that are equivalent to the information and inquiries required for security purposes of ASIO employees. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In practice this will involve inquiries and information gathering equivalent to that required for <span style="font-style:italic;">Positive Vetting </span>to allow<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>access to information and resources at all classification levels, including certain types of caveated and codeword information. This level of investigation and checking would be appropriate for Ministers of State given their access to the most sensitive and highest levels of classified information. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The security checking proposed by this Bill would inevitably involve intrusive inquiries into the personal background and circumstances of Ministers of State. While some Ministers may find this uncomfortable it should be accepted as part of their ministerial duty and a necessary measure to protect national security. However it should be emphasised that the resultant reports will be required to only contain information and advice that is strictly relevant to security as defined in the ASIO Act. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also contains provisions for the safeguarding of reports and requires the Director-General of Security to ensure that reports are properly secured and that reports and all information obtained in the course of making inquiries are only used for the purposes of the Act – that is informing the Prime Minister about security issues relating to Ministers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The work of the Director-General of Security and ASIO under the provisions of this proposed legislation will also be subject to the oversight role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986</span>. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Overall, the Ministers of State (Checks for Security Purposes) Bill 2019 will strengthen protective security within Australia's executive government by ensuring that the Prime Minister is fully informed of any security issues arising from the background and circumstances of Ministers. Persons who wish to be considered for possible appointment to Ministerial office will be clearly and transparently forewarned of the background security checking process they will be subject to and assured that checking process will be undertaken by the Director-General of Security in completely confidential and apolitical circumstances. </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Hayne Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry has highlighted the necessity for banks to be limited to their core industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The vertical integration of the banks providing additional services including financial advice, insurance and superannuation have been shown to be the root cause of rorts, over charging and profit gouging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's best-known finance commentator Alan Kohler wrote in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> on 3 December 2018 and I quote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have been opening a random sample of the 10,140 submissions — just short ones from individuals. Without exception they called for the banks to be broken up and most of them, surprisingly, used the term 'Glass-Steagall' – suggesting that the now-repealed American law that used to forcibly separate banking from insurance and investment banking be introduced into Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Alan Kohler stated further:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That would certainly be a fertile field for the Royal Commissioner to plough, although most of the banks have already announced plans to break themselves up along those lines so perhaps such a recommendation would lack drama.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unlike most commentators and politicians, however, Kohler is not totally fooled by these moves from the banks that appear as if they are separating voluntarily. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Continuing, he made the following very important point:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But Westpac says it will keep its insurance and wealth management division and AMP and Macquarie have not announced any plans to get rid of their banks, so an Australian version of Glass-Steagall would make it uniform and would make sure they didn't slide back into their bad old 'one stop shop' ways in future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Kohler now joins the ranks of other notable Australian experts who have endorsed the Glass-Steagall option.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Don Argus, former CEO of National Australia Bank and former Chairman of BHP, said in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> on 17 September 2011 and I quote: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">People are lashing out and creating all sorts of regulation, but the issue is whether they're creating the right regulation … What has to be done is to separate commercial banking from investment banking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Former ANZ director John Dahlsen wrote in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> on 21 August 2018 and I quote:-</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Problems in banking will not be solved until the structure is changed ... With barriers removed it is possible that banks and the investment market will move to unlock shareholder value in structural separation, following the principle of the US Glass-Steagall Act, which kept commercial and retail banking separate. Voluntary demergers would threaten the gravy train of 'coupon clipping' for fee extraction, but enforced separation in Australia seems inevitable...</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Former ACCC chairman Professor Alan Fels was quoted in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> on 9 August 2018 and again I quote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are a number of serious structural issues that need to be considered, the first and most obvious is the separation of the activity of creating financial products and then offering so-called independent advisory services to customers on what are the best products. A second very important one is whether there should be a structural separation between traditional banking activities and the more risky investment activities … Banks benefit from the implicit guarantee on their deposit liabilities which flows into their trading activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Banking expert Martin North of Digital Finance Analytics stated in his submission to the Interim Report of the Royal Commission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The large players are too big to fail and too complex to manage, and need to be broken apart. A modern Glass-Steagall separation would achieve this, and is proven to reduce risk, and drive better customer outcomes and right-size our finance sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Former APRA Principal Researcher Dr Wilson Sy recommended in his submission to the Royal Commission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The financial system should be structurally separated to simplify regulation, increase competition and innovation, and better serve the community.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Banking System Reform (Separation of Banks) Bill 2018, previously introduced by the Honourable Bob Katter MP in the House of Representatives but since lapsed, is being introduced by Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party into the Senate due to my party's ongoing commitment to overcome the systemic failure in our banking system and, more importantly, in bank management per se.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian population are appalled at the bad behaviour of bank management. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The quest for greater profits to the detriment of their own depositors is disgraceful. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The quest for greater bonuses has transcended into pressure on staff throughout the banking system to push their depositors into taking that bank's financial services advice which results in those depositors taking out related company insurance and superannuation policies without concern as to their suitability. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Banking System Reform (Separation of Banks) Bill 2019 will put in place a banking system that, I hope, will prevent a repetition of the history being aired before the Hayne Royal Commission.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens wholeheartedly support The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 2019 which would ensure broadcasters provide a minimum number of hours of audio description per week. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is embarrassing that Australia is the only English-speaking nation in the OECD that doesn't offer Audio Description for free-to-air television, lagging behind countries like the UK, US, Canada and New Zealand. This bill gives us the opportunity to remedy that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Audio description is an accessibility feature that assists people who are blind, vision impaired, or have print, learning, and physical disabilities to enjoy television, film and live performances by describing what is happening as it happens. It can also help people with autism, by explaining the emotions of characters they see on screen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Free-to-air television broadcasters are already required to caption all news and current affairs programs and any program screened on their primary or main channels between 6am to midnight, unless it's music-only or not in English. It's great that people who are deaf or hearing impaired get to watch the shows they love but why are people who are blind or vision impaired excluded?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This section of the community watches almost as much TV as sighted people. According to a study undertaken by Comcast and the American Foundation for the Blind, 96% of adults with a visual impairment watch TV on a regular basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes will give people who are blind or have low vision similar access to television services as their families, friends and peers, and give clear legislative guidance to broadcasters as to their obligations to provide audio description. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Television and video content is a significant part of our social and recreational lives and everyone should have the right to access it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Audio description was introduced on New Zealand television in 2011, the US introduced it in 2010, and the UK has the most developed and regulated laws, with audio description featuring on both free-to-air and subscription channels since 2003. Germany, Austria, Ireland, France, Switzerland and other European countries have also had some audio described programming. Even Australian productions such as Neighbours and Home and Away are produced with audio description for overseas release but this is not a feature available for Australian viewers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There have been two government-funded audio description trials already conducted – one on ABC1 in 2012 and the other on iView in 2015–16. And then, in 2017 the Government set up an Audio Description Working Group (under the Department of Communications and the Arts) who examined and reported 12 months ago on the options for increasing the availability of audio description services in Australia. And yet, so far, the Government has failed to act on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill has the support and backing of key stakeholders and advocacy bodies in the sector including Vision Australia, Blind Citizens Australia and Australian Communications Consumer Action Network </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition it is a relatively simple proposition. As with Closed Captions for people who are deaf or hearing impaired, it can be turned on or off as needed. It is also relatively inexpensive to deliver and, in fact, is already integrated into many of the programs that are imported from overseas. Different services currently offer Audio Description at the movies, online, while travelling by plane, at libraries, on DVDs and while using apps. In fact Screen Australia has made it a condition as of 2011 that all Australian-made films it funds have to produce an audio description track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens don't believe it's acceptable for people who are blind or vision impaired to be excluded in our society. People with disabilities continue to fall through the cracks, to be locked out of the community and denied the same rights as other Australians. Failings of successive Labor and Coalition governments have perpetuated this discrimination, often denying people with disabilities access to services and the supports they need to live a good life, including audio description. We must do better. it's time to allow everyone the right to participate equally in our society, and that includes watching TV, a right that most of us take for granted. I urge the Government and opposition to support this bill. </span>

                  </a>  Hundreds of homes have started to drop off the National Rental Affordability Scheme, NRAS, with the number of homes swelling to thousands next year. This means many vulnerable people, including families on low incomes, will be left without support and will face homelessness. We are facing a cliff in the housing crisis. Social housing hasn't increased since the turn of the century, despite the rise in homelessness and the rising numbers of those in housing stress. Rental support needs to continue. What we really need is a massive federal investment in building new social housing. It is well beyond time for the major parties to take the housing crisis seriously.</span>

                  </a>  Labor is proud to have established the National Rental Affordability Scheme when last in government. NRAS has successfully increased the availability of affordable rental housing to low- and moderate-income households and is helping more than 63,000 Australians secure long-term rental housing. The scheme has reduced the proportion of NRAS households in rental stress by over 22 percentage points. The government's failure to offer alternative policy or to address the funding gap has exacerbated Australia's housing affordability and homelessness crisis. A Shorten Labor government will directly address the funding gap. In December Bill Shorten announced that a Labor government will improve housing supply and provide long-term affordable housing for low- and middle-income Australians through the construction of 250,000 new affordable homes. Building on the NRAS, Labor will drive residential construction activity through a secure, long-term pipeline of investment, scale up the capacity of the community housing sector, boost employment, and meaningfully address the profound shortage of affordable housing in Australia. </span>

                  </a>  Housing is primarily the responsibility of the states and territories. However, the government understands how important the issue is and is doing its share of the heavy lifting. The government delivered a comprehensive housing affordability plan in the 2017-18 budget. It included providing more than $7.5 billion to the states and territories over the next five years through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement, which includes $620 million in indexed funding for homelessness services, which will be matched by the state governments. </span>

                  </a>  The National Rental Affordability Scheme was introduced in 2008. It was going to solve the affordable housing problem by providing a total of 50,000 dwelling units around the country. By 2012, the Gillard government had seen the deficiency in the scheme and revised the 50,000 figure back to 35,000 dwellings. The plan was to provide financial incentives to invest in rental housing which would be affordable for low- and fixed-income families. In effect, the scheme provided an opportunistic incentive to construct low-cost blocks of small, one-bedroom units near student campuses for investors, many from overseas, to purchase and rent to domestic and international students. In the end, it has done little to meet the need for low-cost housing for low- and fixed-income people. One Nation believes that subsidies are better targeted directly to those who need it and not as costly incentives to developers and investors. The continuation of the scheme, which has done little to improve housing affordability for families and pensioners, cannot be supported. </span>

We welcome the participation of young Australians as part of our next generation of leaders in the UN's work.

Former Australian government UN youth representative Chris Eigeland was appointed by the government in 2017 as a member of Australia's UNESCO National Commission. In that role, he advises the government on youth and communication issues relating to the United Nations. The Australian government's plan for strong economy, return to budget balance and the delivery of essential services is designed to support the future of young Australians. </span>

The profile of Indigenous art has grown tremendously in recent decades. This has resulted in earning and income opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and contributed to both the preservation and dissemination of culture. This rise in awareness and value of Indigenous art has also led to a growing market in fake art and merchandise. </span>

This trade misappropriates Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture, undermining the role of communities. It denies Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists economic and other opportunities as well as deceiving and misleading buyers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The main purpose of this legislation is to ensure an end to the proliferation of fake Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art and art products. It creates a a legislative solution which makes it an offence to supply or offer commercial goods to a consumer that include Indigenous cultural expression unless it is supplied by, or in accordance with a transparent arrangement with an Indigenous artist or relevant Indigenous community.</span>

                  </a>  The family law system is a complex and challenging area. The government are deeply committed to ensuring that Australian families have all the support they need, especially at difficult moments in their lives which can occur when they are caught up for long periods of time in the court system. That is why we have proposed the reforms to the family courts that are before the Senate to improve outcomes for families. We have also established the first comprehensive inquiry into the family law system, which is being overseen by the Australian Law Reform Commission. The government will carefully consider the ALRC's report and recommendations once it is delivered on 31 March 2019. </span>

                  </a>  Although Labor opposes this motion, Labor is acutely aware of the failings of the family law system and the impact these deficiencies can have on families and children. It is important to acknowledge that mental ill health and family breakdown are complex issues and suicide is always a tragedy. There is currently a major Senate inquiry into the government's proposed Family Court amalgamation, which will report in March, and a comprehensive review of the family law system is also being undertaken by the Australian Law Reform Commission, which will report back to the Australian people in April next year. Labor will carefully consider the outcomes of both of these major inquiries before deciding whether a further inquiry, including a royal commission into the family law system, with all the enormous costs and delays that would involve, would assist. In the meantime, Labor will continue to fight for improvements to the family law system, including increased funding for more court registrars, judges and legal assistant services, and capital works for court buildings to make them safer.</span>

                  </a>  My motion here is about male suicides, especially over Christmas. We've just had the Christmas break. The discriminatory aspects of the Australian family law, which act to separate children from parents and grandparents, actually contribute to the increase. Nothing was done about family law until I actually came back to this parliament and started pushing for something to be done. There are deaths happening in this country because everyone is sitting on their hands and doing nothing about it. You say you're going to put more money into it, but it needs more than just more money put into the whole system. It is unfair, and mostly it's unfair to fathers. It's estimated that about three men are suiciding a day and one woman is murdered a week. We need to do something about this urgently. Don't just sit there and think you feel sympathetic about it. We are the legislators of this country. We need to start really doing something. We need to have a royal commission into the family law court matters and start sorting out the problems. It's not only the children who are affected but also the parents.</span>

                  </a>  Family law and child support are complex and challenging areas. The government is committed to ensuring that Australian families have all the support they need. It has proposed reforms to the family courts that are before the Senate to improve outcomes for families. Establishing a royal commission before the government has concluded the reform of the family court system and the Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry into the family law system would not be the best process, as was observed by the Chief Justice of the Family Court. Additionally, the Joint Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs conducted an inquiry into the child support program in 2015 which did not recommend a royal commission but following which the government implemented a number of important recommendations.</span>

                  </a>  Although Labor oppose this motion, once again we are acutely aware of the failings of the family law system and the impact these deficiencies can have on families and children in particular. This has only worsened over the last five years of neglect of the family law system under three coalition Prime Ministers with no interest in these matters. However, there is currently a major Senate inquiry into the government's proposed Family Court amalgamation that will report in March. A comprehensive review of the family law system is also being undertaken by the Australian Law Reform Commission, and it will report back to the Australian people in April. Labor will carefully consider the outcomes of both of these major inquiries before deciding whether a further inquiry, and the cost and delay that would involve, would assist. In the meantime, Labor will continue to fight for improvements to the family law system, including increased funding for more court registrars, judges, legal assistant services and capital works for court buildings to make them more safe for families using them.</span>

The people that we meet on the streets are all concerned about family law court matters and child support. They feel that parliamentarians are not listening to them and their concerns. The family law court also deals with suicides and murders.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You say you're doing something about it, but you're doing absolutely nothing about it. It's the same as how you rejected and did not want a royal commission into the banking sector. You refused to have that because of the cost to the people. We have costs of lives there and how people feel about it. How are you going to feel when the people realise how you're going to vote on this—that you are not interested in dealing with the problems of the family law court that affect nearly every Australian out there? You're turning your back on it. The child support system does not work either. It is unfair and it does not work properly for the Australian people. Think about what you're doing. Listen to the Australian people. They want an investigation into it like the banking royal commission. (<span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span>)</span>

                  </a>  Crocodile numbers in North and Far North Queensland are increasing rapidly. Accordingly, crocodiles are encroaching on regional and urban areas and posing a threat to humans, livestock and aquaculture. The priority of a government should always be to reduce the risk of injury or harm to humans. In Queensland we cull kangaroos, we cull rabbits—we cull rabbits on my place, out at Warwick—yet we do not cull animals that pose a tangible threat to human safety. A sustainable crocodile cull should be considered by the Queensland state government—humans, first; crocodiles, second.</span>

                  </a>  Labor notes that crocodile management, including any need for culling, is a matter that is determined by states and territories. There have been times when culling of native animals has been permitted, for example, when animals are suffering from starvation. Labor notes that the states and territories already have plans in place for crocodile management. Labor also recognises the important role that Indigenous protected areas and Indigenous rangers play in managing crocodiles. Labor supports the work of the states and the Northern Territory planning and management rights in this area.</span>

                  </a>  I support Senator McGrath on this motion, because if you know North Queensland, especially the area around Cairns and as far down south as Townsville, you'll find crocs. People are in danger of having their lives taken. It is quite evident that it does happen on the shore, where horses and dogs have been taken and even children have lost their lives. People have lost their lives because of crocs—and the crocs are moving south. I cannot believe that Senator Chisholm, who is speaking on behalf of the Labor Party and who is supposed to be a senator for Queensland, has no idea of what is happening in North Queensland with regard to this. It would be quite interesting to see if you are going to support this motion.</span>

The Greens are yet to explain why they were happy to take $1.6 million from a single corporate donor and accept half a million dollars from a professional gambler, who is being investigated for tax fraud. Labor has a clear policy to improve transparency in politics and help restore faith in our democracy. It was Labor that worked with our charities and not-for-profits to ensure advocacy work was protected and foreign donations were banned from domestic elections. It will continue to be Labor that pursues genuine electoral reform in the public interest.</span>

                  </a>  The opposition will not be supporting this motion. This is again, as we have heard before, more posturing from the Greens in place of genuine reform. Labor has a clear policy to improve transparency in politics through donation reform to help restore faith in our democracy. It was Labor that worked with our charities and not-for-profits to ensure advocacy work was protected, and foreign donations were finally banned from general elections. It will continue to be Labor that pursues genuine electoral reform in the public interest. As usual, the Greens have chosen politics over policy.</span>

                  </a>  I brought this motion forward to draw the parliament's and the minister's attention to this important issue. Changes to the subsidy to the hourly rate of in-home child care now means that high-needs families are unable to get the child care they need to attend medical appointments, receive respite and go to work. Service providers are leaving the industry and carers are losing their jobs. As noted in the motion, we should recognise that although there are problems with the in-home childcare program some families with complex needs are facing a childcare crisis as a result of the changes. Some changes have been made, but they are not enough. I urge the government to take concrete action on this.</span>

                  </a>  The iconic Longreach and Emerald training colleges are an important component in the Queensland agricultural sector. These colleges have operated for more than 50 years and seen multiple generations of students graduate from them. The colleges are vital to numerous rural and regional communities. I understand that meetings have taken place between the state Labor government and stakeholders. However, there has been no official announcement that these colleges will remain open. The state Labor government needs to publicly reverse the decision to close the training colleges and give certainty to an agricultural sector hit by flood, fire and drought.</span>

                  </a>  This is a blatant political attack by the coalition on a considered decision made by the state government, a decision based on an independent review where 70 stakeholders were consulted, including the local Queensland Liberal National member, Lachlan Millar. This is from a government that has withdrawn funding from Primary Industries Education Foundation Australia, funding that Labor will return. This is from a government that has cut more than $3 billion from vocational education and skills and has stood by while apprentice numbers have dropped by 140,000. This is from a coalition that has failed to create a viable vocational education and training policy after being in government for five years. Instead, they have stood by while TAFE campuses and courses in regional and rural Australia have been closing, course fees have escalated and enrolments have plummeted.</span>

The two major parties have used vocational training and TAFE as a political football for way too long. We have had enough. Through their bipartisan commitment to so-called contestability funding, public TAFE has been gutted. The closure of these two colleges by the Queensland Labor government should be condemned.</span>

These colleges aren't being closed because they refused the fund; rather, the Queensland government has failed to properly plan and attract students to the Emerald and Longreach agriculture colleges. They need to be rebuilt, not torn down.</span>

                  </a>  Once again we see the government blocking the will of the Senate and refusing us the chance to vote on what is an important motion. Cambodia's democracy has crumbled. We've seen a sham election and disgraceful abuses of human rights by Hun Sen's regime. The Greens stand shoulder to shoulder with the Cambodian community. We say loudly and clearly to Hun Sen: we will not stand by while you dismantle Cambodia's democracy. We certainly welcome the position that the ALP have taken with their strong words against the regime in the House last year, but we are disappointed that they've chosen not to co-sponsor this motion with us. Enough is enough. People's human rights are being abused by an autocratic regime. We need targeted sanctions of Cambodia and we need them implemented right now.</span>

Reflecting these concerns, Australia chose not to send observers to monitor the elections and was not represented at the inauguration of Cambodia's National Assembly. The Australian government welcomed the release of the opposition leader from house arrest and continues to urge Cambodia to allow free political participation and debate without violence or intimidation. Allegations of illegal activity by Cambodians in Australia have been referred to the relevant authorities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="244247" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  I rise today to speak in relation to this matter of public importance and the vitally important issue of consumer protection. It's quite clear that the Morrison Liberal government has failed to act on delivering better protections for consumers on a whole range of issues, not least of which the issue we're talking about: the reform of the financial sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to come back to that issue, but I want to outline some of the history leading up to this. I want to make the point firstly that when it comes to stepping up and addressing issues that are of concern to Australian families the coalition has either been missing in action or has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to do the right thing. I'm talking about some of the big issues in Australian history, going to some of the fundamental protections that Australian families enjoy—things like universal health care. Universal health care was opposed by the coalition government at the time, in the 1970s with Medibank and later with Medicare. When it comes to the retirement savings of Australians and the formation of the occupational superannuation system, again, this was something that the coalition opposed vehemently. When we come to reform of the financial sector and the appalling scandals that have bedevilled Australians, not only in the last few years but over the previous 10 years or so, we see once again the government choosing to stick its head in the sand, looking after its big business mates and its banking mates, and eventually having to be dragged kicking and screaming to do the right thing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the precursor to the more recent scandals—some of the scandals that took place under the previous Labor government. We saw things like the collapse of Storm Financial, Trio Capital and Westpoint. All of these things were looked at by the previous Labor government. There was a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry in 2011-12. The reforms that came out of that included financial advice providers being legally required to act in the best interests of their clients and eliminating kickbacks to financial advisers. But these things were fought by the coalition. They voted against Labor's future of financial advice legislation in the House, they voted against FOFA in the Senate and they tried to undermine the functioning of the FOFA reforms when they came to government. But, thanks to Labor taking up the fight on the finance front, FOFA was able to continue, and we went on to see some further work being done by ASIC down the track. For example, in 2016 they found that customers were paying fees for financial advice that was never provided. There were more than 300,000 customers affected by this scandal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of all these scandals at the time, not only was the government dissembling and trying to fight against Labor's sensible reforms—I remember at the time the comments from the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, and Senator Sinodinos opposing some of these changes—but then we saw further scandals erupting. It wasn't until after those scandals that Labor started to call for the royal commission. That was in April 2016. We called for that royal commission in light of all the mounting evidence that was there. We saw the pain that was inflicted on ordinary Australians by banks which had a total culture of greed, being driven by the profit motive and return to shareholders at all costs. That was what was driving the system. In the face of that, Labor decided that there was a need for a royal commission. But once again the coalition was there to block Labor's sensible proposals. Over the 601 days or so that Labor was calling for a royal commission and the coalition was holding out, we had the Prime Minister at the time, Mr Turnbull, adamant that there was not going to be a royal commission. He said that it was just going to be a report and nothing would come out of that. He talked about the royal commission being a waste of money and said that the only thing a royal commission can do is ask questions and that it would be a political exercise that wouldn't do anything to resolve people's needs and concerns. He talked about the fact that the royal commission would be a forum for the legal profession and would go on for years—this is what Mr Turnbull said—and would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and not tell us anything new. How wrong Mr Turnbull was, as it turns out and as many of us were aware. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Turnbull also said that the royal commission would be a waste of time. He said it was a populist campaign. He said that it was just a slogan and nothing of substance. He said it was a political exercise, a cynical exploitation. He talked about it being crass populism. We know that the royal commission has handed down a very substantial report. There is a lot of work to be done, but I think we all are in debt to the work that Commissioner Hayne has done in this area. He has shone a light, over the 12 months of his commission, on some egregious conduct, something which I think many of us wouldn't have expected would have come out. Many of us thought that the situation was bad, but we didn't know just how bad it really was. So this opposition to the royal commission, I think, has been a low point for the coalition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the opposition to the royal commission is not the only way in which this government has let down Australian consumers. I can make reference to some of the work the Senate Economics References Committee has done in its inquiries in a range of areas: looking at the issue of non-conforming building products and the very slow rate of response by the government to a whole range of issues that are coming out there, particularly asbestos coming into Australia continuously, and the government's failure to protect Australians in their homes by taking the step of supporting Labor's principled position of proposing a ban on the introduction of flammable cladding into Australia. The issue of foreign bribery is an area where the government has had an extremely slow response. On the issue of general insurance protections, we had a report in this area, <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's general insurance industry: sapping consumers of the will to compare</span>, finding that there were issues with competition in the general insurance market. Of course, I've already talked about the future of financial advice and the scrutiny of financial advice as well, which has been an area where the government has been completely missing in action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the protection of consumers in a financial sense, I also want to make reference to the superannuation area, where we've also seen the government missing in action when it comes to superannuation guarantee nonpayments, which affect the most vulnerable in society. The rates of nonpayment of superannuation are in the billions of dollars. This has occurred under this government's watch, and collection and enforcement action by the ATO has been very, very disappointing. The best response that this government came up with was an amnesty, and, of course, as part of that, companies got a tax benefit from the underpayment of superannuation. It's come up at the Productivity Commission review, and the royal commission has dealt with this as well. This government shies away from debate on these issues, dragging its feet on reform over and over again. So many times super bills have been listed on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>, and yet we never get to debate them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other areas where this government has been missing in action on consumer protection—for example, payday lending. I give a shout-out to Mr Dick, who has dealt with this particular issue, and, on dodgy rural lending practices and local bank closures, a shout-out to Zac Beers, our candidate in the seat of Flynn. It is having effects on local businesses in Dickson, and our candidate in Dickson, Ali France, is dealing with this issue very clearly. It's time for a Labor government to step in and address this particular issue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  I'm very happy to stand and talk on this motion today. The first thing I wanted to highlight to the Labor Party was how long they took to support the call for a royal commission. It's often not discussed, and it's certainly not in the media frame around royal commissions at the moment, but I think it's important considering we're debating how long it took the Liberals to support a royal commission, and it absolutely did take them too long. The previous Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has recently gone on the record as saying that he wished he'd done it earlier. Well, the call for a royal commission was first made in 2013 by a Senate inquiry which Labor was a key part of. I know from my work in that Senate inquiry that it took me and the Greens nearly two years to get Labor on board. So, if you want to talk about delays to getting outcomes for consumers and taking on the financial services industry for misconduct, it's taken all of us in this chamber way too long to get to this point where we are today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's really important to point out that this has been a nearly five-year journey by a large number of good people to get it to where it is. I would've actually liked to have heard Senator Williams's contribution today, because I think Senator Williams played a key role in calling for this royal commission in the first place. Certainly, the recommendations, which were supported by Senator Williams and by former senator Mark Bishop, who was a chair of that committee, and call for a royal commission would have just remained by the side of the road—a pit stop in time—had it not been for the Greens, who built the wagon, campaigned and moved it down the road through numerous Senate inquiries. In fact, I remember both Labor and the Liberals voting against a Greens motion in this Senate to call a royal commission into the financial services industry. There was no point of difference between you guys. But let me say that I am still very appreciative that Labor did decide to join the Greens in our call for a royal commission in 2016.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, in the remaining few minutes that I have, I'd like to discuss what I've been talking about, which is the 'royal omission'—something that wasn't looked at in the royal commission into banking and financial services. Commissioner Hayne, in his very first public hearing, made it very clear that he felt that the rotten heart of the financial services industry was simply greed—a profit-at-all-costs mentality, a culture that puts profits before people. He told the CEOs in that first briefing to go away and see if they could find the balance and where that balance lay between their pursuit of profits and their ethical duty to customers and other stakeholders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are inherent conflicts of interest in the financial services industry, which became very clear throughout a number of witness hearings. I want to talk about the toxic culture and the inherent conflict of interest that is in this place—in politics—that is very much part of the misconduct story in the financial services industry and very much part of why it took five years for Labor and the Liberals to support a royal commission. You've got mountains of money washing around in this place; you've got both Labor and Liberals taking donations from the financial services companies—millions of dollars in donations over the time period that the royal commission looked into. When we saw systemic misconduct and potential fraudulent and criminal conduct, both the big parties were taking donations. No wonder it took so long for this royal commission to happen; no wonder it took so long to get outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />If we don't fix that culture of greed—that toxic culture at the heart of our democracy—how are we going to possibly fix the problems in the financial services industry? It really saddened me to hear Labor say last week that they were going to continue to take donations from the big banks and the financial services companies. If we're going to get on with the job, we need to understand and respect that lobbyists and donations, pay for play, have caused a big part of a problem that we dealt with in the royal commission and that we deal with in legislation in here. So I would like to see Labor give that money back and the Liberals give that money back. Why don't you put it into a fund for victims of financial crime? I'd like to see CEO bonuses put into a fund for victims of financial crime. We've got to travel a lot further down this road if we're going to fix the problems in the financial services— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  We've come to the end of a royal commission that the current Prime Minister and former Treasurer, Mr Morrison, voted 26 times to prevent. It's an understatement to say Mr Morrison was dragged kicking and screaming to this commission. When the former Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, folded to public pressure and announced the government would finally establish a royal commission, the then Treasurer could not have looked more despondent. He described it as a 'regrettable but necessary action' only taken because 'politics is doing damage to our banking and financial system'. Let's reflect on that a little bit more. It was politics, he asserted, doing damage to our banking and financial system. Those words haven't really aged well, have they? The evidence unearthed by the royal commission is shocking, and it has shown that the royal commission was about much more than responding to political concerns. It was about exposing serious systemic deficiencies. Even the head of the Australian Banking Association has admitted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Suffice to say that it is in everyone's interest that we build a better banking system. And that as painful as the process has been, sunlight is the best disinfectant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It might have been better had Mr Morrison heeded those ideas a little earlier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth contemplating exactly what it meant for Mr Morrison, as Treasurer, and all of his colleagues, to vote 26 times against the establishment of this commission. These are the things that the Prime Minister voted 26 times to hide. These are the scandals, the issues and the problems in the sector that the Prime Minister thought should never be exposed to sunlight. There were multiple institutions charging fees for providing advice to people who had died. There were the financial planners from the Commonwealth Bank subsidiary Count Financial. There were the NAB superannuation services that charged more than 4,000 dead customers. There was AMP deducting life insurance premiums from the superannuation accounts of more than 4,000 dead people. It's just shameful and, in fact, shameless.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission also exposed the aggressive sales culture that took advantage of vulnerable people. The commission heard a now infamous and harrowing recording of a phone call in which a young man with Down syndrome was cold-called and aggressively sold life insurance. When his father tried to cancel the policy on behalf of his son, staff belittled the family in internal messages, and one message referred to that man as a 'bloody whinger'. It was part of a culture that incentivised sales over everything else. There was evidence of luxury overseas holidays handed out as incentives to salespeople, and those incentives were at the heart of the culture of greed that drove these abhorrent and immoral behaviours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were the aggressive claims-handling processes by insurance companies to avoid payouts. CommInsure rejected a woman's claim for treatment for breast cancer because the surgery wasn't radical enough. Another insurer, TAL, hired a private investigator who filmed a nurse in her home and in her pool to fight her claim for income protection arising from an anxiety disorder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission also heard about the irresponsible provision of credit. There were stories from people who had received credit card increases after confessing to their banks that they had a gambling problem and asking their banks to cut them off. It comes on top of the routine underestimation of customers' living and other expenses, including the use of benchmarks like the Henderson poverty index, which is in no way a way to undertake assessments in relation to responsible lending obligations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these things came to light through the work of the commission. These are all the things that Mr Morrison and all of his colleagues sought to hide over and over again in their refusal to support a royal commission. What did the commissioner say about all of this behaviour? He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">First, in almost every case, the conduct in issue was driven not only by the relevant entity's pursuit of profit but also by individuals' pursuit of gain … Providing a service to customers was relegated to second place. Sales became all important. Those who dealt with customers became sellers. And the confusion of roles extended well beyond frontline service staff. Advisers became sellers and sellers became advisers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Rewarding misconduct is wrong. Yet incentive, bonus and commission schemes throughout the financial services industry have measured sales and profit, but not compliance with the law and proper standards … rewards have been paid, regardless of whether the sale was made, or profit derived, in accordance with law. Rewards have been paid regardless of whether the person rewarded should have done what they did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did they act this way? The commissioner was very clear: because they could.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was damning evidence and damning commentary, but the royal commission has now run its course. The evidence, the findings and the recommendations are in the public domain, and it is now the responsibility of the parliament and the government to act. The government is shirking its responsibilities. We've heard from the Manager of Government Business in the House that the issues arising from the royal commission won't be dealt with until after the election. This part-time government, barely sitting in the first half of this year, cannot make time, it appears, to deal with the recommendations in the report. The Prime Minister and his cabinet have lined up to say that the issues are very complex and they need to take the time to work through them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, maybe some other government, some other government with a different track record, some other government with a different frontbench, could get away with saying this. But does any Australian, anyone out there, really think that this government and this Prime Minister really want to take their time for this purpose? Are they really taking time because they want to do the hard work and get the policy settings right? No, they don't. No-one believes anything they say when it comes to banking. They have no credibility, after spending more than a year using every trick in the book to avoid the royal commission being started. Once it did start, they continued to disparage it. They continued to say that it wasn't important. The then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, said in April last year:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Other agencies certainly have addressed many issues being raised. I think that will more directly impact on the public consciousness of these things, but they are not things that the government was not aware of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why didn't the government do something about it, if they knew all about it? Everything about their behaviour suggests that they just don't care. Does any Australian really believe that this government has now seen the light and is beavering away so that if it's re-elected, once the public pressure is off, it can introduce a comprehensive set of reforms? Or is it more likely that the government's delay, its refusal to schedule more parliamentary time to deal with these things, is just another attempt in a very long list to delay action?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen it before when the government takes its time to get it right on financial services protections. It's been reported that the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Robert, got emotional in the other place today describing his experiences with the banks. Maybe he should spare a thought for the families whose lives have been turned upside down on his watch by the actions of unscrupulous payday lenders and consumer lease operators. For more than two years the government has been sitting on clear recommendations to amend the SACC legislation, to put in place protections for vulnerable Australians who have been charged outrageous amounts of interests by predatory lenders. It's been more than a year since the government released an exposure draft of legislation that would respond to those allegations. But it has disappeared into the moor of chaos and indifference on the other side. Nothing is being done to support these very low-income people. Nothing is being done to rein in scandalous behaviour in that sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government cannot be trusted to act on financial services reform. They have not acted on the payday lenders, despite saying that they would. Is there any reason for anyone to believe that they will act on these recommendations? Why should we give them the chance? Time and time again they've been presented with an opportunity to make change and they have failed that test. In fact, one of the first things they did upon attaining power was to seek to wind back the FOFA reforms. Their first priority when coming to government was to remove protections for consumers. Every fibre of their being sees every problem in the banking sector through the perspective of the banks and the financial services sector. So many of their people are drawn from that sector that they are unable to see these things through the lens of the consumers. They cannot be trusted to act on financial services reform unless their feet are held to the fire. History repeats itself: delay on SACC; delay on response to the royal commission. Australians deserve a great deal better than what they're getting.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>):  I think I would agree with all senators in this place that the banking royal commission has revealed for us some terribly damning happenings in the financial services sector; things that none of us want to turn our backs on and ignore, things that do need to be addressed. This is why I find it a bit rich when senators opposite complain about the government and the time it's taking to outline its plans to respond to the recommendations of the Hayne royal commission. It's something that we've outlined quite clearly and very publicly; it's something that the opposition have not yet been able to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not often that I agree with my friend and fellow Tasmanian Senator Whish-Wilson—about as much as I agree with Senator Polley, I suppose, which is not very often either—but the point made by Senator Whish-Wilson in his contribution is something that I think Australians need to be aware of, and that is that the opposition, who talk about this historic fact of how many times a government voted against motions for a royal commission, spent two years rejecting the same calls for a similar inquiry. Now they are trying to take the moral high ground. They come in here and say, 'This government should've done it the first time we moved a motion.' What happened between the years 2013 and 2014? They are as guilty as those they point the finger at. So we're not in here to have a history lesson. We're not here to rake over the coals of history. That has been done. We've had the royal commission. We've heard the heart-rending stories. We've seen the terrible deeds that have been done to hardworking Australians, who simply wanted to get ahead and trusted the banks, the insurance providers, the superannuation funds and all the other entities involved in this inquiry. We now need to act. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the commission's findings had been presented to government, we had the opposition demanding that everything be released immediately, including the government's response. Yet here we are, days later, and the opposition are yet to outline a position when it comes to default superannuation funds and what they'll do for the small business operators, the mortgage brokers, who have been quite vociferous in their communication with members of this parliament about how the recommendations, if implemented, would impact on their business. I think we need to take stock of what would happen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point made by the opposition is that they would agree in principle to all the recommendations—which is part of what they've said; I'm not sure what that actually means. This would devastate the mortgage broking sector. The great majority of home loans provided to hardworking Australian families is, as I understand it, through mortgage brokers. You only have to think about the competition that they provide. If you go to a particular big bank, they're not going to tell you about the bank down the road and the rates they're going to offer. They're not going to tell you about the small credit union and how they might be a bit better for you. That's what a mortgage broker does. Let's not forget that these people are small businesses. There are 17,000 of them across the country, employing more than 20,000 people and providing a service which has seen a reduction in rates that banks apply to home loans in great numbers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition can rake over the coals of history, but there is an election coming up later this year and this is a group of people who say they want to be in government, who say they can be trusted to run this country. I would encourage them to provide us, to provide the Australian people, with their answer to the royal commission and its recommendations. What are they going to do? If they are going to implement everything which they agree with in principle, as they say they will, how will it impact on those who rely on the services that mortgage brokers provide? Tell us what they're going to do about the default superannuation situation. How are they going to address these things? They haven't and they won't. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the few seconds remaining to me, I think it is important to talk about what we have done. To sit there and rake over the coals of history about how many times a motion had been voted against is one thing, but we should actually look at the facts of what has happened in this place over a period of time and what measures the government has put in place to make the financial services sector better for consumers. There was the inquiry in 2013 and the Bank Executive Accountability Regime, which started in July 2018; the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, which started last November—a free service; and $170 million in more funding to ASIC—just to name a few. Action has been taken. They can rake over the coals of history but they should stump up now and tell us exactly what they're going to do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  As a matter of public record, the Turnbull-Morrison government fought tooth and nail on behalf of its bank cronies to prevent a royal commission into banking. The royal commission only occurred because a backbench revolt led by Senator O'Sullivan forced the government's hand. Then, when we finally got the royal commission, the government tried to turn it into a whitewash, appointing only a single commissioner, severely limiting the time allowed for it to report and, of course, greatly restricting the terms of reference. At my instigation, a motion was passed unanimously by the Senate calling on the government to extend the terms of reference to include liquidators, receivers, auditors and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation and increase the time available for the commission, yet the government simply ignored this motion. During the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, around 6,000 victims were allowed to tell their stories to the commission. However, during the royal commission into the banks, only a tiny handful of small-business owners and farmers were allowed to testify.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to this, on 14 August last year I organised a meeting for farmers here at Parliament House to tell their stories. Around 150 farmers attended and put on formal record the appalling accounts of mistreatment—tales in which banks imposed millions of dollars in penalties in response to single missed payments, in which banks used the police as their private goon squad and in which one bank manager actually urged a desperate farmer to kill herself. I approached the Leader of the Government in the Senate privately and asked that the government listen to the victims and act on the motions passed by the Senate, but my request fell on deaf ears. Again today I met with bank victims here at Parliament House to discuss what we could do to get them justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that the royal commission has been a tragic missed opportunity. It has uncovered serious criminal misconduct by the banks, but it has also not actually recommended any criminal charges be laid. It has identified gross failings and mistreatment of borrowers, but it has not recommended any legislative response. For the thousands of desperate rural families who have lost their properties due to criminal misconduct by the banks, there is no solace in this and certainly no appropriate compensation. As things stand, the royal commission and the government have failed utterly to meet the expectations of the Australian community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  I rise to speak on the Morrison government's failure to act on delivering better protections for Australian consumers after it voted 26 times against establishing a banking royal commission. We now know the finance sector has fallen short of treating Australians honestly and fairly. The finance sector has made mistakes and needs to apologise for those mistakes. Mr Morrison, I ask you: where is your apology? The big banks have, one after another, admitted wrongdoing. Where is your apology to hardworking Australians who have been taken advantage of daily by those big banks? Mr Morrison, where is your apology for being so out of touch as to claim that there simply was no problem and that Labor's insight was just a populist whinge? Well, Mr Morrison, the issue is quite popular now, isn't it? The Australian people have received your response loud and clear. You chose to pass the buck, to push ownership elsewhere, anywhere but where it lies—with yourself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Labor was to blame' was your response. The irony is not lost on Australia. It was Labor who, for month after month, called for a banking royal commission, and it was you who fought tooth and nail against it—26 times, in fact, you voted against it. That is 26 times you denied a fair go to ordinary Australians, 26 times you failed to protect and stand up for Australians and 26 times that you—as Treasurer no less—defended what has now come to light about the 54,000 breaches of terrorism-financing and money-laundering laws. And that was just one bank. Was it not yesterday that you stood in front of the Australian people and proclaimed that the Liberals were the party of strength, that you were protecting Australia from organised crime and money laundering and that keeping Australia safe and secure was the government's top priority? That's cute, isn't it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why should the Australian people trust a government that had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, in the first place, to hold this royal commission? If there is one thing the banking royal commission revealed it's an issue close to my heart, the exploitation of older Australians by people in positions of trust, be they financial institutions, family, friends or carers. Revelations of irresponsible lending from the banking royal commission are a sobering reminder of the banks' failure to help protect older Australians from financial abuse, scams and fraud. These revelations are also a reminder that this incompetent government stood in the way and failed to act in the best interest of these people for years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pattern is clear, and we ask ourselves: what institution will fall next because of this government's neglect? I think of our aged-care sector, which has reached a crisis point under this government: '26 times too late' is the cry of the Australian people. It is now the cry of our elderly. Our aged-care system is in such a mess under this incompetent, do-nothing government that it had to call a royal commission into its own failings. That is how incompetent and inept this government is. Those opposite should be ashamed of the five years of their government's failure to protect older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again, Mr Morrison, you refused to cooperate, offering nothing but scaremongering and empty rhetoric about a so-called conspiracy aimed at undermining confidence in our financial system—$100 million in fines later, with more on the way, and I must admit that you were right, Mr Morrison. This has been quite the conspiracy. It has been the conspiracy of a government uninterested in keeping our big banks accountable and uninterested in protecting the financial interests of hardworking Australians. It has been a conspiracy embedded within neglect by this out-of-touch government and the out-of-touch attitude that has plagued it from day one. It has been a conspiracy that cares more for the profit of the government's own interests than for a fair go for the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has let Australians down and is still doing it, day after day. It's time the government called an election so the Australian people can voice their opinions on how inept the government is and how it has failed them right across the board, whether we are talking about the banking royal commission or about the royal commission into the aged-care sector and its own failing— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance proposed by Senator Collins, but before I do I would like to remind the chamber of a little bit of history. The Labor Party had six years in government—six years in government—in which they could have called a royal commission. In fact, so many of the incidents that Commissioner Hayne heard about when the royal commission hearings were underway in the last 12 months occurred under Labor's watch. It was in fact the current opposition leader, Mr Shorten, who was at the time the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. Despite all of this going on under his nose—despite the financial scandals of Trio, Storm and Opes Prime—not only did the Labor Party not call for a banking royal commission; in fact, they defended themselves against one. In fact, Mr Shorten, who was, I remind the chamber, at the time the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, said at the time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has some of the best banks in the world. It is partly because of our excellent regulatory system and prudent management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was Mr Shorten, quoted in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> in February 2012. So it's ironic, hypocritical and highly convenient that the Labor Party would now start wagging the finger at the coalition—the coalition who did in fact announce a royal commission into the banking sector, in November 2017. In the last 12 months we've had 68 days of hearings and heard from 130 witnesses, and more than 10,000 submissions have been accepted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that wasn't the beginning of the coalition's attention towards the banking sector. In fact, the moment we came to government the Financial System Inquiry was commenced. I might add: that was against the will of the Labor Party. That was in December 2013. The Murray inquiry was one of the most far-reaching inquiries into the financial sector in decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also, I will remind the chamber, brought in the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, known as the BEAR, which came into effect from July last year. Once again, we brought the Labor Party along with us on these reforms, kicking and screaming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the pattern repeats itself again. The Australian Financial Complaints Authority, AFCA, began last year, in November. And, on top of that, additional funding of $170 million has been provided to the regulators, to ASIC and APRA, and also to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Federal Court, so that they can effectively pursue misconduct in this sector. Additionally, the coalition appointed a new chair of ASIC and new deputy chairs of ASIC and APRA. So action had been taken well before the banking royal commission was even called.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, the royal commission itself was an important undertaking. Commissioner Hayne found that the financial sector misconduct had been driven by a culture of greed in the pursuit of short-term profit ahead of the interests of customers. In fact, the commissioner's own words were:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There can be no doubt that the primary responsibility for misconduct in the financial services industry lies with the entities concerned, and … their boards and senior management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the irony now is that the Labor Party is calling for legislative change but Commissioner Hayne in fact said that more often than not the conduct that was condemned was contrary to existing laws; they simply weren't officially enforced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Commissioner Hayne made 76 recommendations, 40 of which require legislative change. I understand the convenience of suggesting haste in making those 40 legislative changes, but those opposite know full well that making appropriate, considered, measured legislative change can't be done in an extra fortnight of sittings. Where's the stakeholder engagement? Where's the consultation process? If we don't want to risk unintended consequences that would have negative effects for consumers—that wouldn't protect consumers but would have negative effects on consumers—then these things will take a little more time. A knee-jerk reaction will do no good for anyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those 76 recommendations—and the government has committed to acting on all of them—fall into four different areas: improving outcomes for consumers, enhancing the accountability of the industry, ensuring strong and effective regulators, and providing redress for those who have been most harmed by misconduct. However, the government not only has said it will take action on all 76 recommendations but has expanded the Federal Court's jurisdiction to incorporate criminal misconduct and it's also expanded the BEAR, the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, to non-prudentially regulated entities. These recommendations go above and beyond those of Commissioner Hayne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a number of consumer outcomes to do with protecting farmers and to do with advice and superannuation. But I personally think that the real interest is in the extraordinary hypocrisy that has arisen today in the accusation of the Labor Party that the coalition are not acting on those 76 recommendations. Not only have we said that we will act on all of them, and we have been quite definitive about that, but the Labor Party are yet to come out and tell us if they will. They have said they will agree in principle with the 76 recommendations; they just haven't landed on a few of them—for instance, default superannuation. Commissioner Hayne said there should be one default superannuation fund for all participants in the industry. I can understand why the Labor Party might feel a bit uncomfortable with this, because decoupling superannuation from industrial relations is a bit of a sticking point for you guys. It goes against the entire vested interests that you have within the superannuation industry—that unholy alliance between the Labor Party, the union movement and particularly the industry superannuation funds. How are you guys going to manage to propose reforms to superannuation as recommended not just by Hayne but also by the Productivity Commission to protect consumers if you have those vested interests? You cannot. You are incapable of reforming superannuation to advantage consumers over providers because of those vested interests. It's just not possible for you. Only the coalition can reform superannuation in favour of consumers over providers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ultimate irony is that we have legislation right in front of us today, right now, sitting on my desk, that is addressing some of the issues that Hayne specifically mentioned. For instance, we have the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 in front of us right now and yet we have spent so much time today wasting the chamber's time, doing almost anything else other than dealing with government business that would in fact enact some of those Hayne recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My great frustration in this is that the government have been reforming the financial services sector from the first day we were elected. The financial systems inquiry started that ball rolling and we have been systematically addressing the recommendations made by the Murray review. The Treasurer has led a very comprehensive response to the royal commission in just days. In fact, it was only two days, I think, after we had the commission's report before we released the government's response. The opposition has had that report for more than twice the time that the government has had it and yet has not come out with anything even vaguely comprehensive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor don't know how to reform the financial services sector. They never have been able to because of those vested interests. The Law Council made the same point just today. The government will deal with the recommendations from Hayne in a very sensible and prudent manner and, most importantly, will put customer interests first, not unions and not industry superannuation. Labor's vested interests prevent them from ever making meaningful reforms that prioritise consumers over providers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Restoring trust in Australia's financial system is part of the coalition's plan for a stronger economy. Australians can trust the coalition and do trust the coalition when it comes to managing the economy. They do trust the coalition when it comes to managing the economy because we don't go and beat an important sector of our economy with a baseball bat senselessly, thinking that the consequences are meaningless. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We were all shocked to hear of the fraudulent money-laundering schemes, charges against dead people and a host of other irregularities, not to mention the losses our farmers and primary producers suffered at the hands of the banks. In the wake of the royal commission, 24 cases have been referred for possible civil and criminal prosecution. While the government voted 26 times against a royal commission happening, it seems the bankers and the executives have got off scot-free. Perhaps the government knew the result, hence they voted the way they did 26 times, but that doesn't make it right. Then again, what did Labor do prior to the 2013 election when it was still in power? The Labor Party had chances to call for a commission but instead sat on its hands, and now it wants to play the righteous card.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I put motion after motion calling for a royal commission in this chamber, only to be ignored by both major parties. Meanwhile, scores of Australians and many businesses have been annihilated and lost millions of dollars. What's even more alarming now is we have the mortgage brokers coming under fire for simply trying to do their jobs and get people into the housing market. The royal commission came out swinging and, as a result, has knocked the head off the mortgage-broking industry. Meanwhile, the bankers have been given a slap on the wrist and their share prices have increased.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both sides of politics have chosen self-preservation, influenced by big donations by the big four and political pointscoring instead of protecting Australians who have been financially affected by the banks. Both sides of politics spruik their ideology, but when the time comes to put their philosophy into practice they are all hot air. One Nation, on the other hand, has been standing up for farmers and consumers who have been shafted by the banks since day dot. Shame on you all. You can't fool the Australian people, and we will show this come the May election.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  I rise to contribute to this debate. Now the politics start. Let me give you a bit of a history lesson. Of course I called for a royal commission many years ago when I got involved with Storm Financial and many other things. But what's happened since then? I'll tell you what's happened. I met with whistleblower Jeff Morris, who will be here tomorrow for my final speech. We got working on the Commonwealth financial planning and worked with Adele Ferguson. It all became public and so on it went.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Senate estimates one night I said to Peter Kell, the Deputy Commissioner of ASIC, 'Mr Kell, why did it take 16 months for you to react to the whistleblowers when they got in touch with you?' He said, 'We got a great result, Senator Williams—we had an enforceable undertaking'. I asked the question again. Mr Kell did not answer the question. I turned to the then chair, Senator Mark Bishop. I said, 'Chair, how do we get these people to answer a question?' He said, 'I can't direct them how to answer the question.' Luckily, Senator Cameron's staffer was watching. The staffer said to Senator Cameron, 'Dougie, they're belting Wacka up, you better help him.' Senator Cameron came into the Senate estimates—I'll repeat this tomorrow in my valedictory speech—and said, 'Mr Kell, don't give me the run around the mulberry bush like you gave Senator Williams, I warn you.' After that little display of Senator Cameron's front-foot activities, he walked out and said to me, 'Wacka, we should have an inquiry into ASIC.' I said, 'Good point, Dougie'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We drew up the terms of reference. All the chamber agreed with it. We had an inquiry into ASIC and how it did its job. At the end of the inquiry, a great job chaired by Mark Bishop, the then Labor senator from Western Australia—and a decent bloke, I might add—we recommended a royal commission. Who opposed it? Labor opposed it. The government opposed it. I imagine some of the crossbenchers opposed it. When the motion was put forward by Senator Whish-Wilson of the Greens to have a royal commission, I crossed the floor and sat with the Greens. I remember saying to Senator Di Natale, 'When I join the Greens I will become leader—you watch me and see how I go.' I got a giggle back. Senator Dastyari was sitting over there. He voted against a royal commission. That's where the big force came from—that committee. That's where it was driven from. It was a couple of years later that Labor finally supported it. What really brought the royal commission on, it's all about numbers in here and the other place. We always knew that the royal commission would pass a vote in the Senate, but it would not pass in the House. That is until two MPs, The Nationals' George Christensen and Llew O'Brien, went out public and said, 'If it comes to the House, we will vote for it.' So the numbers were in the House because of the National Party members Llew O'Brien and George Christensen there—make no mistake about that. The banks realised that the numbers were there in both houses to pass a royal commission. They wrote to the government and said, 'Bring it on.' The rest is history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we drew up the terms of reference—I commend my colleague Senator Barry O'Sullivan for this—we included superannuation in the terms of reference. If Labor had drawn up the terms of reference, I would have been very surprised if they had included superannuation, because they would want to cover the industry super funds and their friends there. What did the royal commission tell us? It told us that there are a lot of bad doings and wrongdoings and bad behaviour in the superannuation funds, especially the retail funds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission has done a great job. The media have done a great job highlighting the wrongdoings. I commend the bank leadership now for saying that they know it's wrong and they have to fix it. That is exactly how it will be. But the question is, for how long? How long will the right activities be carried out? We don't know. In 10 or 15 years we will have different board members in the banks, and life insurance companies like AMP will have different CEOs. Will it still be right then? We've had numerous inquiries: the Martin inquiry, the Murray inquiry, numerous parliamentary inquiries and now the royal commission. The situation of people before profit must be embedded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a new code of conduct coming out on 1 July in the banking industry. It's voluntary. You don't have to join; but if you join, you must abide by it. I think we should lock in a mandatory code of conduct in the finance industry to see that good behaviour and respect carries on not for five or 10 years, but for 50 or 100. It's disappointing to see the banks' reputation being trashed. When I was a young fellow the bank manager was the most respected bloke in the town. There were no women bank managers in those days; they seemed to be all blokes. Thankfully, it has changed now, and they are giving women a much fairer go in the senior positions. But we need to make it last. I commend the government for taking it on. I commend my colleagues Llew O'Brien and George Christensen from the other place, the MPs. They gave the numbers. I commend the banks for asking for it. I don't think they realised how much they were throwing themselves under the bus. Now it's done. AFCA's in place. Let's get the wrongs righted. Let's cement it in for decades to come. That's the big issue: how long will it last? I hope it lasts for generations and generations. I hope that faith is restored in the banking industry, because we need banks. We need good, strong banks. We have good, strong banks. We need them to behave properly with many of the other institutions as well.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  I rise this evening to speak in support of Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. This year, the theme is 'It's time for ovary action'—a clever play on words. You can make what you want of its meaning, but one thing is clear: we need action, 'ovary action', because too many women are dying from ovarian cancer. Each day, four Australian women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer and three will die. It's time for all Australians to be able to identify ovarian cancer and to take 'ovary action' so we can change the statistics for future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to women's health, and ovarian cancer more specifically, there is no such thing as an overreaction—or, should I say, an 'ovary action'! When it comes to the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer, we need to know the signs, symptoms and risk factors and we need to talk about them. We also need to educate ourselves on the risk factors of ovarian cancer, because some of us are more susceptible to the disease. There is no early detection test for ovarian cancer, so the best way of detecting the disease is to know and recognise the signs and symptoms. This is what will save lives. The symptoms of ovarian cancer are often dismissed as common discomfort that women experience regularly, but we need to listen to our bodies and take these symptoms seriously. Pushing them to the side or being told by GPs, or anyone else, for that matter, that we are overreacting has to stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not okay that women like Sue visit the GP an average of three times before being properly diagnosed. Sue knew something was wrong when she started to feel bloated all the time. She just couldn't work out why. She lived with this discomfort for two months before finally going to see a doctor. The doctor told her to give up wheat, milk and alcohol, but nothing seemed to work. She lived with the discomfort, as I said, and eventually went back to her doctor, who told her she had a blockage. She was so unwell that she couldn't get upstairs to her bedroom. Fed up, Sue's daughter booked her in to see a different doctor, who sent her straight to hospital to have fluid drained from her abdomen, and they confirmed that it was stage 3 ovarian cancer. It's also not okay that a woman like Lauren, who was so bloated she looked like she was about six months pregnant, was told by three different doctors that she had irritable bowel syndrome. Lauren specifically told her first doctor she was worried it was ovarian cancer, but the doctor said it was probably IBS and delayed the diagnosis. One night the abdominal pain got so bad she was rushed into hospital, where they found tumours. Lauren went on to be diagnosed with stage 2 ovarian cancer. She ended up having two lots of surgery, chemotherapy and blood transfusions and, sadly, Lauren is no longer with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stories like these frustrate and anger me. We need better awareness and education in the community—and this includes in medical circles. Better education amongst our GPs and specialists is absolutely crucial to survival. When it comes to a diagnosis, every minute is vital because, if ovarian cancer is found in its early stages, women have an 80 per cent chance of being alive and well after five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I implore my fellow Australians to not let another Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month go by without 'ovary action'. Let's 'ovary act' by learning the signs and symptoms and having conversations and learning about any family history of ovarian cancer. Talking about it to other women empowers women. Let's encourage women to talk about their family history and health history and have those conversations with their doctors. But the only way we're going to save lives is for women to pursue a second opinion if they're not satisfied with what their local doctor tells them. We have to have these conversations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all at Ovarian Cancer Australia for all the wonderful work that's done by our researchers, who are working hard to learn more about ovarian cancer and how to treat it. Cancers like ovarian cancer, which are often diagnosed at a later stage, are the ones that we need to be funding more. We need to change the statistics around ovarian cancer, and it is the continuing responsibility of this government and future governments to provide more funding to support this research so that we can change these awful statistics.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  This summer we've had a very strong focus on some of the climate extremes our country is facing. Also over the last couple of weeks, due to family circumstances, I've been giving a lot of thought to the future of our planet and the future of this country. The extremes that we've been facing this summer bring into stark reality the impacts of climate change. Over the summer we've had heat extremes. We've broken record after record. At one stage, we had the 15 hottest places on the planet. We've had those tragic floods and we've had fires in Tasmania, where we've lost not only properties but also irreplaceable ecosystems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We continue to see, of course, the devastation that mismanagement and climate change are having on the Murray-Darling Basin. We've seen the impacts of climate change and coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. We've seen the reports of species being driven to extinction in the Wet Tropics, the reports of the impact of climate change on species in the Northern Territory, and, over the last couple of days, the reports of the impact of climate change on the Shark Bay region in Western Australia. That is an absolute tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shark Bay is a World Heritage area in Western Australia. It was created in 1991, and I'm proud to say that I was a key part of the campaign to get Shark Bay listed on the World Heritage List. I was also a member of the Shark Bay World Heritage Advisory Committee for many years. It's about 830 kilometres north of Perth, and, for those who don't know it, I would highly recommend that you visit Shark Bay. Unfortunately, the news is not good, so I'd suggest you do it fairly quickly unless we see dramatic action on climate change. It is an absolute tragedy that nearly 30 years later we have not seen the action on climate change that we need. We continue to see this government in denial. We continue to see the hands out taking big donations from the miners and from the big developers that refuse to acknowledge that climate change is having an impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who don't know Shark Bay, it is one of a handful of World Heritage properties around the world that meet all four natural criteria for listing. It has spectacular natural landscapes—it's described as 'superlative'. It is an example of exceptional beauty, which is one of the criteria for natural listing. It is an example representing the major stages of the earth's history, and I will come back to that in a minute. And it has significant ongoing ecological and biological processes and important and significant natural habitats for conservation of biodiversity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">World Heritage listing was absolutely deserved for Shark Bay. But the impacts of climate change, which is predominantly affecting the marine environment in Shark Bay, saw a marine heatwave in 2011 which wiped out 36 per cent of the seagrasses. The seagrasses are an absolutely key part of the World Heritage listing and an absolutely key part of the ecosystems. Those seagrasses were irreplaceable. Because Shark Bay is at the boundary of the southern and northern extreme of the ecosystems, it has systems that are found nowhere else—that are irreplaceable. It also means that the seagrasses are living at the edge of their extremes. So any increase in temperature is going to start wiping those out, which is what we've seen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem here is that enough research money is not being put in to look at these impacts. There are about 115 projects funded for the Great Barrier Reef, which is great, but only nine for Shark Bay. Not only do we need to act absolutely urgently on greenhouse emissions and on climate change but we need to invest very heavily in saving the Shark Bay World Heritage area. It is a tragedy that that area is under such threat.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  We have to get government under control. Government is a result of politicians with no principles, public servants whose first principle is to look after their own careers and a legacy of policies and programs introduced long ago for reasons no-one remembers. We have to start asking, 'Why does government do that?' and, 'Can't that be done by people using their own money?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My frustration at restrictions on our ability just to live our lives and make our own decisions without being harassed by governments supposed to serve us is what motivated me to get into politics. I definitely didn't do it for fun or to make money. If we were free to go about our business and make our own decisions, paying for these decisions from our own pockets, we'd be better off, both individually and collectively. Individually, we'd be masters of our own futures, and, collectively, we'd form communities of choice rather than forced association.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of us could look after our own health care, education and child care in a way that we individually prefer, not the way the government dictates. There would be more money in our pockets, greater respect for privacy and more time to spend with loved ones. There would also be more money to look after the genuinely unfortunate—those who actually do need a hand up rather than those who demand, and too often are given, a handout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What concerns me is that younger Australians won't even have the freedom I had to establish a business or to pursue their dreams more broadly. Maddening bureaucracy makes it difficult to focus on your craft and your customers. Punitive workplace regulations make it difficult to hire staff. Crippling taxes make you question whether it's all worth it. And the option of a cushy Public Service job, or even welfare, further reduces your motivation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the government providing more and more of our needs, even though we need government less and less, given widespread economic growth and prosperity, younger Australians are being left with the heavy debt my generation has placed on them. We've been borrowing to spend rather than invest. This has been going on under Labor and Liberal governments alike; there is hardly any difference between the two.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Democrats' mantra of personal responsibility and living within our means reflects the interests of all Australians: the Indigenous and the migrants, the black and white, the latte sipping and the beer chugging. None of us is served by a fawning monster of a government, and with government out of the way much of the antagonism between different groups in Australian society can fall away. I don't mind what the guy next door is doing because I'm not paying for it. My government doesn't need to ban what they're doing, and they don't need to ban what I'm doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Democrats will keep fighting for the good, because the alternative is selling out your principles, as the major parties did long ago. It's clearly a recipe for disastrous government and voter contempt. To those voters who continue to vote for a major party: please wake up and start using your votes smartly. Government can't be fixed by those who broke it; it can only be fixed by outsiders with a coherent vision of a better way. We can do so much better, not through more government but through less.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STORER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  An efficient, professional and well-resourced public service is at the heart of a healthy democracy. Without it, people cannot get the services they expect and deserve, and respect for the political process is likely to decline, as is respect for democracy itself. For these reasons, I believe in the value of a well-functioning and well-resourced public service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How can we solve the many challenges we face as a nation if we do not have the right people working in the public interest to identify policy solutions and programs to address those challenges? I am particularly concerned about the loss of corporate knowledge and the quality of services to the public associated with outsourcing. Between 2013 and 2017 Public Service staffing was cut by more than 14,000, with the government insisting that the level return to, and not exceed, the level of 2006-07. The irony is that this has not necessarily saved money. Over the same period, spending on external consultants has risen from a shade under $400 million to close to $700 million. Nor has it necessarily improved the quality or delivery of services. For example, there were problems with the 2016 census which undermined public confidence in this essential policy-making tool. The data it contains is critical in the development of the widest range of decisions affecting all Australians, from the provision of roads, schools and hospitals to the priorities for budget planning as the age profile of the Australian population changes. Who can forget the cost to the government's reputation of the robo-debt saga, Centrelink's automated debt recovery scheme, and the stress it caused some benefit recipients when it mismatched their employment and payment records? Public servants skilled and experienced in managing benefits would have identified inconsistencies within the computerised system. Targeted recipients would have suffered less anguish, the costs would have been lower and the government would not have suffered all the bad publicity—grief would have been avoided all around. For similar reasons, and to protect our national security, I am opposed to the privatisation of our visa services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will do whatever I can to fight these measures. They are short-sighted and reduce the expertise of the Public Service. They have eroded the quality of service Australians have come to expect and in real terms have done little or nothing to reduce the cost to the taxpayer.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="244247" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:37</span>):  I rise tonight to update the Senate on Labor's activities in my duty electorate of Petrie, with special emphasis on the issue of aged care. Aged care will be a key battleground in the next federal election. We know that the coalition is scrambling to put money back into the aged-care sector after having cut $1.2 billion from it when Mr Morrison was Treasurer. We know that there are 127,000 Australians on the waiting list for home care. We know that there are dozens of reviews that have been ignored by the government and that Mr Morrison is now hiding behind the royal commission. In contrast, Labor continues to listen to the aged-care community. We're committed to improving our aged-care system, and we can stand proud on our record, having delivered the $3.7 billion Living Longer Living Better reforms when we were last in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So Labor is out talking to the community. I give particular respect to Corinne Mulholland, who is Labor's candidate in the seat of Petrie. She has taken it upon herself to listen to members of the aged-care community. Together we've been going to a number of aged-care facilities over the last number of months. We went to the OPEL North Lakes facility—thanks to operations manager, Andrew, there for hosting us. We went to Seasons Aged Care Mango Hill—thanks to Kelly, Rosemary and the team there for organising the activity, which included a lovely morning tea. We were pleased to give a donation to the Foodbank fundraising drive on the day. We went also to Lodges on George. There was a very informative tour of the facility, and I look forward to visiting that facility again in the future to tour their newest wing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's always very good to meet with residents, family and friends during these visits and to answer their questions about the parliamentary process and the Senate. We have some very lively discussions during the course of our episodes there. I look forward to visiting many other aged-care facilities and retirement facilities across my duty electorates in coming months. I'm really looking forward to hosting the shadow assistant minister for ageing and my friend, Senator Helen Polley, to meet with our candidate, Corinne Mulholland, and local seniors in the Petrie electorate next month. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other campaign activities which we're involved with in the Petrie electorate. It's important to note that the campaign office for Petrie was launched on 27 January. So many supporters from the community and branch members came along to witness that event. Many House of Representatives and Senate colleagues also attended the launch of the campaign office. We had doorknocking in Fitzgibbon with a community barbecue on Sunday and Stirling Hinchliffe, one of the local state members, was in attendance. Coming up, we have the Griffin twilight community barbecue this Sunday afternoon at Peppercorn Street Park in Griffin. It is important to note that shadow finance minister, Jim Chalmers, will be joining Corinne Mulholland and me for a banking forum on 23 February at the Bracken Ridge Tavern. I look forward to members of the community coming along there to hear from the shadow minister about the royal commission and the ramifications of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our fantastic candidate Corinne Mulholland is out doorknocking every day in the Petrie electorate, talking to locals about school funding. She is talking about the fact that Labor will deliver $23.3 million more for Petrie schools than the Liberals over the next three years. In the area of health, Corinne has announced that we will restore the Liberals' cuts to health funding and deliver new MRI licences for Redcliff Hospital and the Prince Charles Hospital at Chermside.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On infrastructure, we're talking about the fact that it was Labor that delivered the Moreton Bay rail line. We'll build on that by delivering the Cross River Rail and delivering the Linkfield Road overpass at Bald Hills and by expanding the Mango Hill train station park and rides. It is clear that while Liberals play catch-up, copying Labor's commitments in Petrie, I'm proud to be supporting Corinne Mulholland, one of the hardest workers I know.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:43</span>):  I rise this evening to offer my most sincere and heartfelt congratulations to this year's Australia Day Honours recipients. Those recognised by these honours are Australians from all across our great nation who have selflessly dedicated their time in pursuit of a better Australia. Coming from all walks of life, they are exemplary in leadership, commitment and resolve—three virtues animating the Australian spirit. These Australians have taken to heart the words of the old proverb which exalts us to be the change that we want to see in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As all members of this chamber well know, I am an immensely proud Victorian and, as is the case year-in, year-out, Victorians are once again very well represented in this round of Australia Day Honours. I wish to wholeheartedly congratulate Victorian recipients of the recognitions of their achievement. Each and every one is so richly deserved. More specifically, I'd like to single out my congratulations and thank the following Victorian recipients who have so significantly contributed to and strengthened the fabric of our society. To the recipients of the Medal of the Order of Australia, or the OAM, in the general division, my sincere congratulations go to Mr Robert Bath of Ballarat for his service to the community of Ballarat through arts, sport and education; Mr Colin Campbell of Rutherglen for his service to the wine-making industry for more than 25 years; Mrs Carmel Clemson of Gisborne for her multifaceted service to the community of the Macedon Ranges; Mr Ian Glanville of Bendigo for service to the print and broadcast media and also to the community of Bendigo; Mrs Jean Hamilton of Longwood for service to the community of Longwood for more than 40 years; the Reverend Father Edward Harte of Bendigo for service to the Catholic Church of Australian and the wider Victorian community; Mrs Margaret Lonsdale of Keilore East for service to the sport of dance in Australia and the representation of our nation in the sport; Mrs Marilyn McQualter of Whittlesea for her service to the community of Whittlesea through her continued volunteerism; Mr John Mildren of Ballarat for his service to the Parliament of Australia and also to the community of Ballarat; Mr John Mitchell of Corryong for his service to the community as a philanthropist and also to the health sector; Ms Susan Natoli of Box Hill for her service to the sport of canoeing and to youth; Mr Graeme Pearce of Mandurang for his service to the community, particularly through the CFA; Mrs Margaret Saker of Benalla for her service to the community of Narooma; Mr Peter Stokie of Bright for his service to the conservation of the Victorian malleefowl; Mr John Taylor of Myrtleford for his service to the Myrtleford community through education and also history; Mr Walter Van Nieuwkuyk of Burwood for his service to the performing arts; Mr Russell Walker of Gisborne for his service to the community of Victoria more broadly in a number of quite varied roles; and Ms Frances Walsh of Rutherglen for her service to local government and the community of the Indigo shire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have a couple of particular friends that I would like to mention—personal friends—including Ms Patricia Vejby, Trish, for her service to her local community. Trish has held a number of board positions, including Commissioner to the board of the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria and Director of the Royal Victorian Association of Honorary Justices board. She's very proudly from the western suburbs of Melbourne and has made an extraordinary contribution to Victorian public life. Trish, thank you very much for your extraordinary work. I'd also like to recognise a very good friend of mine, Ms Felicity Frederico, for service to her local community. I've known Felicity for the better part of a decade now and through that time she's been a passionate advocate for women's sport, particularly women's football. She was the mayor of Bayside Council and, while she was there, she launched a program called the Grass Ceiling campaign to address the lack of female change rooms within the municipality's sporting facilities. This resulted in a series of redevelopments through the Bayside Council's sport clubs to provide women's change rooms. Felicity truly has been a tireless advocate of female participation in sport. She's been effective even in motivating me to be more active, which is no small feat. She got me into stand-up paddleboarding, something I will never forgive her for! I assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President McGrath, it is, in fact, a real sport. Nonetheless, I'd like to congratulate Felicity and all the OAM recipients. Congratulations again to all of these recipients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to congratulate those that have been awarded membership of the Order of Australia for their outstanding and selfless public service. To the recipients of the Member of the Order of Australia, or the AM, in the general division—there are too many to name all of them individually, but I want to make mention of just a very special few. They are the Hon. William Robert Baxter of Rutherglen for his significant service to the people of the Parliament of Victoria; Ms Mary Therese Draper of Alphington for her significant service to community health as a consumer advocate through her contributions to delivery standards as well as governance; Adjunct Professor Ian Maxwell Dunn of North Fitzroy for his significant services to the law, legal standards, education and specialist accreditation, and as a practitioner in the areas of negotiation and dispute resolution; Dr Gillian Margaret Gale of Box Hill North for her significant service as an educator to children who are blind or have low vision; Mr Gary William Morgan AFSM of Alfredton for his significant service to the community through emergency response organisations; the Hon. Professor Howard Tomaz Nathan QC of Bendigo for his significant service to the law and to the judiciary through the Supreme Court of Victoria; Mr John Wilson Payne of Surrey Hills for significant service to art conservation and restoration as a leading practitioner, scholar, teacher and mentor; and Professor David George Wood of Tawonga for his significant service to chemical engineering as a researcher, mentor and academic. Congratulations to all those AM recipients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now like to recognise Professor Caroline Finch of Soldiers Hill. On this Australia Day, Professor Finch was welcomed as an Officer, AO, of the General Division of the Order of Australia. Professor Finch was recognised for her distinguished service to sports medicine, particularly in the area of injury prevention, as an educator, researcher and author and for her promotion of improved health in athletes and all those who exercise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to extend my warmest, personal congratulations to those awarded the Companionship of the Order of Australia, General Division. This is an extraordinary honour, recognising our most outstanding citizens and the extraordinary work they do. Professor Rhys Jones of Blackburn North received the award for eminent services to mechanical and aerospace engineering. Professor Jones has been the head of the Royal Australian Air Force at the Centre of Expertise in Structural Mechanics for more than 22 years. Professor David William Kissane of Surrey Hills received the award for his eminent services to psychiatry. Professor Kissane has been a leader and trailblazer in the palliative medicine sector in Australia and served as foundation chair for palliative medicine while also holding the position of director of palliative care at the Centre for Palliative Care at St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge and congratulate those most recent recipients of military crosses, medals and commendations, many of whom cannot be publicly named due to their ongoing operational commitments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, finally, one more person who I would like to mention, and that is Mr Stuart Wood QC. I have known Stuart a very, very long time—since we were at university. He received an AM this year for significant service to the legal profession, particularly in the area of industrial relations. Stuart is one of this country's leading workplace relations QCs. He is gifted with an extraordinarily fine legal mind and a terrific sense of humour to boot. I have known Stuart for such a long time. He was slightly more successful in his classes at university than was I. Stuart, congratulations on your award. It is much deserved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two special times of the year in which the government and the community can express our sincere gratitude to those exemplary citizens who represent the very, very best of the Australian spirit. It is an absolute honour to be able to stand here this evening to name and honour these dedicated and conscientious Victorians. I thank the chamber for its indulgence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250362" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:52</span>):  Just a few weeks ago, I was out at Menindee to see firsthand the Murray-Darling Basin in ecosystem collapse. The Darling River, the Barka, is dying. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan isn't working and the government tells us: 'Everything is fine. Nothing to see here.' I saw stagnant rivers, cracked, dry earth and locals red hot with anger at the federal government and the New South Wales Liberal-National government for their role in the slow death of the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an urgent and a national crisis. State and federal governments have used and abused the system and turned a blind eye to blatant water theft and greed. The New South Wales government, especially, sides with the big corporate irrigators against the community, against their drinking water, against the environment and against river health. It is a case of profit over people. It is a case of profit over the environment. We know of the gross maladministration, the corruption, the negligence and the unlawful actions that have occurred. This has been confirmed by the recent South Australian royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bret Walker SC severely criticised the plan for its lack of consideration of climate change. The report highlighted the particular lack of commitment to the plan from the Victorian and New South Wales governments. We also know of the water theft, the overallocation and the tampering with meters. Once again, politics, shamefully, wins over science.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, it is the community, the environment and the animals that bear the cost of corrupt public policy. We have seen well over a million fish dead in multiple fish kills. Locals told me about seeing dead goannas, dead birds and dead kangaroos around the riverbanks. They told me about the threats and intimidation from vested interests when they speak out. That's why we in here must speak out for the people and the planet. I spoke with Aboriginal elder Uncle Badger Bates about the Barka, its cultural importance to Aboriginal people and how they have watched the river slowly peter away, not just over the last few years but over the last few decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that climate change is biting. We are in the middle of a climate emergency and things will only get worse. Every minute we stay silent is a minute lost acting on climate change and protecting our precious water. You lot definitely need a big lesson in science. As a water engineer, I know that healthy river systems only function when they're allowed to have significant environmental flows. The system has been denied that for years by rules that privilege big corporations and operators over the environment and the community. For years this river system has been used and abused for profit. At every meeting I went to in Menindee, there were a few very clear asks—in particular, for return flows from upstream, to establish a royal commission to get to the bottom of this disaster and to criminally prosecute the politicians that are responsible for this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to overhaul the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, put the environment at the centre and ensure that any future modelling is done in the context of climate change. The impending collapse of the basin, comprised of 77,000 kilometres of rivers, is of utmost importance and it is critical that we act now. We cannot hope to protect our mighty Murray-Darling system if we don't address the elephant in the room: dangerous climate change. That will mean more and more severe droughts and heatwaves. That means prioritising the environment and the people. Climate change is pushing us closer and closer to the edge. Natural disasters like bushfires, extreme heat events, drought, flooding and ecological failure of our rivers are becoming more and more common. How much more disaster, loss of life and environmental catastrophe will it take for this government and this parliament to take real action on climate change? Why can't politicians see what the community clearly sees? Why are politicians so wilfully ignorant of the need for urgent and rapid action to save our planet?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even when they do recognise the need to act on climate change, they refuse to acknowledge 'king coal' as the biggest single source of carbon dioxide emissions from human activity. Both the Labor and Liberal parties are addicted to coal—or perhaps, more correctly, they are addicted to the corporate donations from the fossil fuel industries. Over the last three years, Liberals, Nationals and Labor have taken almost $3.7 million of dirty money from fossil fuel companies. That influences their judgements and their decisions. How else can you explain the Labor shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, coming out and saying there will be no Adani ban on his watch? Alex Turnbull, the son of ex-Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has revealed the sickening influence of coal barons on Liberal Party policy. Contrast this to Germany, the fourth-largest economy in the world, which is going to phase out all coal power by 2038.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see you for what you are: a bunch of cowards who are happier to see our country burn than to take on vested interests that stymie real climate action. How can you not see that our ecosystem is in crisis, from the disastrous fish kills in far-west New South Wales, to Tasmania burning in devastating and unprecedented fires, to Townsville being hit by 1.4 metres of rain in less than two weeks—around double what falls in London in a whole year—which led to massive floods? Every day you delay action on climate change, you're contributing to making Australia less safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no surprise, though, that we don't have policy on climate change and quitting coal. Corporate donors are buying policy outcomes that suit their bottom line because they know both the Labor and Liberal parties are up for sale. We need the Greens in the Senate because this is a disease that affects both the Labor and Liberal parties. They remain beholden to mining giants, property developers, the gambling industry and the big banks. Whether it's a meeting here or a dinner there, whether it's a slight adjustment to some legislation or just an extra few years of a loophole being left open, these are the small corruptions that rot the entire system. The Greens will hold both parties to account and make sure it is the interests of the community that are heard in parliament, not big corporate interests. We will clean up politics of corporate donations and stop the revolving door of politicians and lobbyists. We will lift the fog that shrouds the halls of power. I'm proud to be part of the Greens New South Wales. We are a party funded and wholly directed by members and community, entirely free from the influence of business interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, though, having integrity in politics goes far further than refusing to take corporate donations or to let lobbyists write your legislation, though both of those things are crucial. Being a politician of integrity involves being in this place for the right reasons. I'm a career engineer, not a career politician. I'm here for public service, not to wait for a pension or a plush board appointment when I retire, and I think our politics would be better if more people took that view. I've sat in parliament and watched career politicians pass bills written by lobbyists. I've sat in committees and watched MPs ignore expert advice and evidence because it doesn't match up with what their donors are telling them. I've sat in inquiries where witnesses have begged the major parties to listen to common sense and act in the interests of the people. But the interests of the people didn't match the interests of the developers, so the developers won out. If we are to have a parliament of integrity then we must have a parliament that can't be bought. The Greens cannot be bought, and we will never sell out the community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:01</span>):  I rise tonight to honour Gavin Hillier, a courageous unionist, a fiercely loyal Labor man and a flamboyant Elvis fan. I convey my sadness and deepest condolences to his relatives and friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gavin Hillier was a colleague and a comrade. He was a roof tiler from the country who, when working at Laminex Customwood in Wagga Wagga, got involved in his union because he thought he could do a better job of representing its members. He went on to lead the Australian Timber Workers Union in New South Wales and its successor, the Forestry and Furnishing Products Division of the CFMEU. In this position he played a pivotal role in the forestry disputes of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Gavin was tough, brave, constructive, influential and effective. A person of extraordinary ability with an outsized personality to match, he would later work as an organiser in the New South Wales branch of the AWU.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gavin Hillier attributed his unionism to his father, also a loyal unionist but later left high and dry by the union he had fought for and done the job for. Whilst this broke his father, Gavin's response was to very quickly get involved and help him out. This demonstrates two elements that were to mark Gavin's later career in our movement: he recognised that union leaders had to make tough decisions but that they must always act in the interests of members. It also showed that his instinctive response was to lead from the front, taking personal responsibility when things needed to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gavin joined the Australian Timber Workers Union in the early 1980s. It was reported by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> that he found the union executive was not interested in the members' welfare and he decided to correct this by becoming active within the union. When he became secretary of the New South Wales branch of the ATWU in February 1987, he replaced Joe Weir, who had held the position for 45 years. This union later merged to form part of the CFMEU in the early 1990s, and around this time I moved to New South Wales from South Australia and joined the union as an industrial officer. These were formative times, and I was fortunate to have Gavin as a colleague and comrade. The closeness of our connection and the impact he made upon me are reflected in my words here tonight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Gavin took over, timber workers were poorly represented and underpaid and had to work in unsanitary conditions. Working in a sawmill was dangerous, with many fatal accidents each year. Gavin set about fixing these wrongs with zeal, often relishing the disputes with employers along the way. In his first three years as a union leader, Gavin shook the sawdust of decades from the union's structures and more than doubled its membership. It was for these people that he fought the hardest. He got the biggest real wage improvement for timber workers in Australian history. He achieved wage improvements of 18 per cent in real terms during his time as secretary, and then he added superannuation to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gavin's involvement with the timber workers and later the CFMEU led to heightened activism within the New South Wales timber industry. He had the courage to recognise that the union could not keep operating the way it had and he took on a huge internal fight about the restructuring of the timber industry that was to last over a decade. He also made clear he would rather try to make alliances with conservationists than the employers, but he also recognised that he needed their buy-in too if the industry were to survive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenges of leading the Timber Workers Union at a time of significant change, not in the forestry sector but across the Australian economy, were not ones that Gavin shied from. Too many leaders tell people what they want to hear and few have the courage to speak hard truths. Gavin had such courage. On one occasion he had to go to Eden on the south coast of New South Wales, and he insisted on going alone. Sawmilling of timber was an important industry for most of the life of the town, and for over 100 years the collection and export of wattle bark was also a major industry. At the time, he had to sell the changes to the timber industry to understandably hostile members. I remember him calling me and speaking to me about being spat on and screamed at as he walked down the main street—a journey he took by himself deliberately. He was jeered and heckled in a fiery meeting attended by timber workers and their supporters, including their families, all encouraged by the employer. These were not easy times. The decisions he made, the leadership he provided helped to sustain an industry that might otherwise have been wiped out. And today the major export handled by the Port of Eden is still wood chips.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gavin Hillier's career was defined by his representation of the union during the forestry debate of the 1990s. He was one of the primary negotiators of the package, in partnership with then Labor leader and later Premier, Bob Carr, and Kim Yeadon, who became the land and water conservation minister in Carr's government. Having worked with Gavin at the union, I then saw this policy debate from the political side as an adviser to Mr Yeadon in the mid-1990s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gavin had previously been burned by government decisions that were not accompanied by consultation, and had also disagreed with Labor in state opposition and federal government. Famously, he and many others once organised a picket of the whole of Parliament House while Labor was in government, and I was on that picket line as a union official representing our members. Gavin also received support from the ACTU secretary, Bill Kelty, who spoke movingly at his funeral. Bill Kelty described the agreement that Gavin engaged in as a matter of enormous achievement and was very clear about his praise of Gavin's role in this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Logging of native forests, then as now, was contested and controversial, and the conflict, then as now, was not only around environmental policy; it was about the livelihood and way of life of timber communities. Gavin Hillier recognised that the reliance on native forest was becoming unsustainable politically, economically and environmentally, and his objective was to carve out a better path for his members and their families. His vision was for an industry that could move to higher-value jobs in softwood, plantation and downstream processing, and lessen its reliance on native forests. He saw this path delivering better jobs, higher pay and more security than the annual political fight over timber quotas could deliver, and for this he was prepared to agree to a more rigorous process of forest assessment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The package he was part of negotiating phased out logging of old-growth forests and provided millions of dollars for the retraining and relocation of workers. It increased plantation timber whilst delivering industry support for value-added production. Native forests were protected with the creation of 24 new national parks, and a rigorous system of forest assessment towards creating a comprehensive and representative reserve system was entered into. To enable industry reform and restructure, measures including reducing timber quotas by 50 per cent were implemented, but they were made tradeable and they were extended to terms of five years. What did this do? This provided certainty. It provided certainty to industry and ensured that timber could go to the highest-value users. It was a complete package: have new national parks, ending old-growth logging, reducing timber quotas, supporting workers and have rigorous forest assessment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet I recall members of the Greens political party still calling us 'tree killers', which demonstrated to me very clearly that purity and virtue signalling, for that political party, came first. Gavin Hillier contributed more for forest conservation in New South Wales than the many politicians and environmentalists who preen publicly, and to do so he had to show personal courage. And it was a reform delivered in his conviction that it was the right thing for his members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gavin passed away in December of last year. His funeral was held in Wagga Wagga just prior to Christmas. The music of Elvis Presley, another of his great loves, was heavily featured. I deeply regretted that I wasn't able to attend the funeral, but I'm grateful to those who have been in contact in recent weeks as we have spoken about Gavin Hillier. I particularly want to acknowledge Mary Stuart, and also the words of Bill Kelty. In his eulogy, Mr Kelty described Gavin as: 'A very significant character in the Australian industrial landscape. Simply put, Gavin Hillier is actually one of the bravest, toughest and most effective union leaders I have ever worked with. He was certainly one of the most unusual—he certainly was the most unusual. Of that there is no doubt. And he was loving, caring and committed.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Kelty is rightly recognised as one of Australia's most significant, consequential and respected trade union leaders—one of the most respected in our history. That he would speak at Gavin's funeral and give such a stirring tribute speaks volumes about the respect with which and regard in which Gavin was held. So we mourn Gavin Hillier's passing, but we remember his courage, toughness and leadership. But perhaps most of all we remember his heart—loving, kind, brave. He has been described as friend, mentor and hero and, as Bill Kelty said, his spirit will never die. I again express my condolences to his family and his many comrades.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:11</span>):  I rise tonight to share my disappointment at another case of serious sexual harassment by a current senator that is currently under investigation—a married senator. This same senator has also forced the Australian taxpayer to pay out other previous unfair dismissal cases during his term. Each of those people has been gagged from speaking publicly about their experience, and I respect the decision they have made to accept those terms and remain silent. But what is disappointing is that this parliament has allowed the horrible treatment of staff to continue without this senator being forced to go through some form of training to prevent the poor treatment of his employees. I'm not talking about one or two staff: I'm talking about more than six in this term of parliament. And I blame this parliament for allowing the gag orders to leave this vulnerable woman exposed to the treatment she's gone through. This gutless wonder we call senator should tonight hang his head in shame.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:12</span>):  2019 has been determined as the International Year of Indigenous Languages. This gives us an opportunity both here and across the world to celebrate and engage in conversations about Indigenous languages and the fact that 90 per cent of Indigenous languages around the world are considered endangered. It's through language that we communicate with the world, define our identity, express our history and our culture, learn, defend our human rights and participate in all aspects of society. Through language people preserve their community's history, customs and traditions, memory, unique modes of thinking, meaning and expression. They also use it to construct their futures. Language is pivotal and essential in the areas of human rights protection and good governance, peace building, reconciliation and sustainable development. All of these are key to the 2030 agenda. Our focus this year is in terms of Indigenous languages, but it fits into this continuing conversation across the world about our culture, our unity and our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A person's right to use his or her chosen language is a prerequisite for freedom of thought, opinion and expression, access to education and information, employment, building inclusive societies and the values that we've enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Many of us take it for granted that we can conduct our lives in our home languages without any constraints or prejudice. But this is simply not the case for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the almost 7,000 existing languages across the world, the majority have been created and spoken by indigenous peoples, who represent the greater part of the world's cultural diversity. Yet it's been identified that many of these languages are disappearing at an alarming rate, as the communities speaking them are confronted with forced assimilation, enforced relocation, educational disadvantage, poverty, illiteracy, migration and other forms of discrimination and human rights violations. This is certainly true in our own country, where we have an opportunity this year, with great support, to celebrate Indigenous languages. In Australia, we know that our history has been cruel to First Nations languages. In fact, the research that has been done indicates that the danger to Indigenous languages continues to be very severe in our nation. The elders, who have been the protectors of the language, need to have our absolute support so that we can protect the beauty, the integrity and the future of Indigenous languages in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AIATSIS, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, has been maintaining Aboriginal language documentation since 1964. It's clearly a national leader in the collection, documentation, preservation, research and essential revival of Australian Indigenous languages. There are surveys done to look at what's happening with Indigenous languages in Australia. There's a wonderful quote that is being celebrated this year as part of International Year of Indigenous Languages, by Brooke Joy, a descendant of the Boandik people from the Mount Gambier region in South Australia. Her comment about her own language was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Strong cultural identity enables one to feel proud of themselves, and speaking and maintaining one's language raises self-esteem and enables one to feel good about themselves. Traditional language is important for maintaining strong cultural connections. Where traditional languages have been taken away from communities, a sense of loss, grief and inadequacy develops. To keep communities and generations strong, traditional language being passed from one generation to another is vital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the absolute joys that I've had since I've been in this place is my work on the National Library Council—that absolute treasure of our nation which exists three blocks away from Parliament House. In this International Year of Indigenous Languages, the National Library is working closely with AIATSIS to examine issues around Indigenous languages in our nation. The first official event for the year's celebrations is the launch of a wonderful book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ngana Ngai</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic;">Who am I?</span> I apologise, in using a native language, that I probably have just destroyed the pronunciation of the name of this wonderful book, but I had the chance to look at the book last week. It's an engaging paperback book for young children and it's being published this month to celebrate the year. The book introduces young readers both to native animals and the concept of Indigenous language, in this case the Kaurna language from South Australia. Through this book, everybody—not just children but everybody—has the opportunity to learn the words for animals such as parrot, wombat, kangaroo, cockatoo and echidna and discover a simple fact about each animal. Excitingly, Australian Standing Orders Scholastic, a book distributor to the education sector, has purchased 1,000 copies of the book, which means it will be distributed to schools throughout the country as well as being sold in bookshops across Australia and New Zealand. It is an essential element of the celebrations of our year that we engage with children so that they can learn about the beauty of Australian First Nations languages and also feel confident and proud to use these languages and, as Brooke said, understand the value of culture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the year, there will be many exhibitions, and many activities and calendars of events will be put up across the country. The Department of Communications and the Arts is the relevant department which is organising this. Also, we have very active engagement at the national level and internationally. People may know that recently the wonderful <span style="font-style:italic;">Cook </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> the Pacific</span> exhibit closed at the National Library. One of the core elements of that exhibit was looking at native languages. As Cook travelled around the Pacific, he and the other people onboard ship took amazing records and actually kept records of Pacific languages as they were moving around. These treasures were available when people went to see the exhibit at the National Library.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The closing event of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cook and the Pacific</span> exhibition marked the commencement of the Year of Indigenous Languages. Last weekend, Language Keepers: Preserving Indigenous Languages was a forum which focused on the word lists recorded on Cook's three Pacific voyages. These have become invaluable sources for historians and First Nations people. Over the weekend, experts in Australia and the Pacific discussed how the revitalisation of Indigenous languages is supporting practice and healing, and also focused clearly on the role of libraries and archives to support language restoration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have opportunities through this year to learn, to enjoy, to celebrate. We are part not just of this opportunity in Australia but also of the international discussions. As I said, the loss of the native languages across our country has meant the loss of identity. The library also has plans for improving access to the existing language collections through the year, particularly through digitisation and consultation and by working closely with AIATSIS to ensure that people across this nation will be able to preserve and understand original product written in First Nations language by talking to elders, talking with people who research in this area to maintain the exquisite and quite wonderful tonal native elements of First Nations language. This is an important time for all of us. I think we need to learn, we need to engage in this process and we need to understand that, working together, we can preserve language and then, through that, preserve culture.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator BURSTON:</span>
                  </a>  Australia in recent times has experienced disturbing developments in the threats to the nation's security and to its political and economic independence. Our very democracy is challenged by Chinese state owned government companies that are systematically targeting every sector of our society for their own national interest and using unlimited funds to buy their way into Australian society. The Chinese communist government is in the process of taking over our culture. Nearly every one of the Chinese departments at our universities is funded by the communist government of China. If we follow the money, scholarships, research projects, student and lecture exchanges will all be used to ensure that the Australian view and the view given to the Australian government reflects the view of the Chinese government and what it is in its best interests, not ours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some courses at Sydney University are majority attended by Chinese nationals. The great learning assets of our nation have, in essence, been handed over to another power so they are no longer available to Australian students to the extent they used to be. Sydney University conducts graduation ceremonies in Beijing, awarding degrees and postgraduate degrees that in earlier times would have been awarded to Australian citizens. Money has been used as an effective tool to suppress our national conscience and deprive our children of their heritage. Even Event Cinemas over Christmas had 50 per cent or more of movies other than children's movies made in China with English subtitles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The attack on our Australian way of life is deliberate and well-coordinated and well-funded by the Chinese government, a government that has no respect for our democratic institutions, including this parliament, or the sovereignty of the Australian people. We have seen the communist government of China thumb its nose at the International Court of Justice and continue to expand and militarise the South China Sea. Justice to the government of China means doing what you're told and doing what China wants. Indeed, every member of this parliament has at one time or another been subject to lobbying by individuals paid and recruited by the Chinese government controlled companies in Australia to do their bidding. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Millions of Chinese citizens suffer and do not enjoy the basic freedoms we enjoy in Australia, because of the repressive and undemocratic practices of the communist government of China. China should not have those principles, and members of the Australian parliament should not do the bidding of a foreign power. Last year in this place we saw how a Labor member of parliament was having his expenses paid by Chinese government owned companies and how that senator was quick to support Chinese government expansion in the South China Sea. Likewise, a Liberal minister was quick to endorse a Chinese company's takeover of Darwin Port and then accept a job paying over $800,000 a year as an executive of that company. Thirty pieces of silver is all that it takes to buy Australian sovereignty. In my home state of New South Wales, Chinese interests have now acquired rights to the Port of Newcastle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must warn all Australians of the serious threat they face to their sovereignty and freedom by the failure of our elected leaders to protect and defend our nation. I am particularly concerned about the Western Australian Labor government and Liberal opposition teaming up—in particular, their increasing camaraderie with Chinese state owned enterprises that seek control of Australian property and critical infrastructure. Make no mistake: this is a matter of national security and alarming for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently we've seen Western Australian Labor MP and upper house whip, Pierre Yang, being forced to resign from organisations affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. These Chinese communist government organisations are dedicated to extending Chinese communist government influence in Australia and supporting the establishment of Chinese government military bases in the South China Sea. Mr Yang also spent several months on a Chinese government ship searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Was this a vessel spying on the Australian military? I ask that because it spent little time in the actual search zone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">China's relentless pursuit of Australian politicians is worrying for anyone who values our nation's democratic freedom and sovereignty. It was reported in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> that Mr Yang's political mentor, Edward Zhang, is a member of several Chinese based organisations that are run by the Chinese Communist Party. Western Australian Labor Premier Mark McGowan and the Liberal Party opposition leader in the Western Australian state parliament recently attended a gala dinner hosted by Mr Zhang. Both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party have received large donations from Chinese government associates in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor Premier McGowan, at the instigation of Mr Yang, recently visited China in Mr Yang's company to meet members of the Chinese government. Following the Premier's meeting with the Chinese government, Labor Premier McGowan announced in state parliament that he was prepared to change state legislation which guaranteed Australian company Mineralogy rights in the Pilbara to, in essence, favour China's biggest conglomerate, the Chinese government owned CITIC Limited. Such a move would result, if legal, in the Chinese government's subsidiaries controlling the $5 billion port facility at Cape Preston in the Pilbara which has been established on Mineralogy leases.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, despite the existence of an airstrip at Karratha, which is used by BHP, Woodside Energy and other mining companies, Chinese government owned companies, under a cloak of secrecy, have built an international-standard airstrip capable of landing jets. This is part of China's strategy to control all approaches by land, sea and air to the port at Cape Preston. Chinese government control of Australian ports and airports is a matter of national security for all Australians. No Australian could control a port in China or build a private airport in China capable of landing and operating fighter jets and bombers. Even Pig Iron Bob Menzies would not have allowed the Japanese to establish a naval base and airport on the Australian mainland prior to World War II.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Western Australian Labor government is favouring Chinese government interests over the rights of Australians and Australian national security. Either Western Australian Labor Premier McGowan is so naive that he is blind to the stealth of their approach or he is too weak to challenge them and stand up for Australia. The United Australia Party will, after the next federal election, in this place move to establish a Senate committee to inquire into the role played by Chinese government owned companies in our economy that threaten Australia's security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August 2018, the Australian government disqualified Chinese owned tech giant Huawei from taking part in the rollout of 5G mobile infrastructure due to growing national security concerns. Soon afterwards, our government blocked the $13 billion sale of Australian owned energy company APA to Cheung Kong Infrastructure, or CKI. APA owns a $20 billion 15-kilometre-pipeline network which delivers natural gas to 1.3 million Australian homes and businesses. The sale would have given CKI and another Chinese state owned company ownership of 100 per cent of gas transmission pipelines in New South Wales and the ACT, 99 per cent in Victoria, 86 per cent in South Australia, 78 per cent in Queensland, 74 per cent in the Northern Territory and 65 per cent in Western Australia. The sale was blocked because it was contrary to the national interest. Why, then, is it deemed acceptable to allow Chinese government owned corporations to control major infrastructure and exert an unhealthy influence over an Australian state government and Australian politicians? The government's role should be to protect the Australian people and put Australia first. Anything less is an act of treason. The Anzacs put Australia first. It's time this parliament does.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:30</span>):  Once again, bushfires have plagued Tasmania for the start of 2019. It is not something that Tasmanians are unfamiliar with. We suffered terrible losses around Lake Mackenzie in the Tasmanian central plateau in 2016 and the destruction of the fishing town of Dunalley in 2013 and, of course, so many Tasmanians, including my parents, remember the 1967 bushfires that plagued the state, killing 64 people and destroying whole towns. But this January, 2019, was Australia's hottest month since records began. It was Tasmania's driest January ever. The Tasmania Fire Service has stated that fuel loads were 20 per cent to 30 per cent drier than average. Tasmania's maximum temperatures were much more than three degrees above the long-term average for the month. So, of course, the fires came, and they haven't stopped. Already they've burnt some three per cent of Tasmania's forests, with the Central Highlands and the Huon Valley suffering extensive devastation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a climate change tragedy, a tragedy that has, despite the outstanding work of firefighters from Tasmania, the mainland and our neighbours across in New Zealand and even with the help of water bombers from overseas, removed a horrifying amount of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area off the map. We have lost homes, businesses and tens of thousands of hectares of alpine vegetation. The flames were scorching the edge of the largest remaining forest of thousand-year-old King Billy pines in the world. We have lost key wilderness tourist attractions, like the iconic Tahune AirWalk in Geeveston. I have fond memories of visiting the Tahune AirWalk—the treetops of it—with my children when they were young. Everyone loved this incredible wilderness attraction of feeling like you were almost on top of the world, walking amongst the trees. But now the incredible photos taken by Matthew Newton of the ash debris after the wildfires just show how devastating they've been through Tahune and elsewhere. The owner of the Tahune AirWalk, Ken Stronach, reflected, though, that we do have now an opportunity to re-create this attraction and give it a rebirth as the forest slowly regenerates over the years ahead. I do hope the air walk will take us into the sky again to join with Australia's tallest tree, which, I'm glad to report, was protected from the bushfires burning in the Huon Valley. At 100 metres tall, the centurion tree, a <span style="font-style:italic;">Eucalyptus regnans</span> and the world's tallest flowering plant, is near the Tahune AirWalk, but the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service and the Tasmania Fire Service were able to protect this globally significant tree that lives in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the fires burnt southern parts of the state, I was walking the iconic Three Capes Track—48 kilometres of cliff-hugging wilderness in the Tasmanian peninsula which is just one per cent of Tasmania's land area but has one-third of Tasmania's flora. What an incredible place our island home is, and what an amazing walk. From the melaleucas to the moorlands, to the Cape Pillar she-oaks and sea cliffs and views of past lives with the lighthouse on Tasman Island, from the Blade to the fairytale rainforests, then back on the coastal cliffs with Cathedral Rock, the Monument, Hippolyte Rocks and the Totem Pole, and all the Tasmanian plant species and wildlife in between. But as I walked along the cliffs, I could see and I could smell the smoke drifting all the way to New Zealand from fires 100 kilometres or more away. In fact, it was reported that New Zealand firefighters were called to attend a fire near Milford Sound due to thick smoke in the area, only for the crew to discover that there was no fire to be put out. Indeed, the smoke was coming from Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Within this tragedy, though, heroes have emerged. Heroes like Geeveston pharmacist, Ian Magill, who stayed, despite the emergency warning for his town, to ensure that other residents in the town had access to urgent medical support; like firefighters and volunteers and those that travelled from interstate and overseas to help protect lives and property; like local Tasmanian volunteer firefighter Tom Andrews, who missed Christmas, missed his son's first birthday and even missed his wedding anniversary. Local ABC Radio was a vital source of information, and journalists routinely went into the heart of the action to keep us informed and provide life-saving warnings to local residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But if the experts are to be listened to, this extreme heat is a sign of things to come. December 2018 was the warmest on record. There were heatwaves in every state and territory according to the Bureau of Meteorology, who have warned that temperatures are set to rise further in years ahead as a result of climate change. Climate scientists from the University of Tasmania have warned that dry lightning strikes, like the ones that started some 60 fires across Tasmania in mid-January, including the fires that I've already talked about, will increase in frequency because climate change and the hot, dry conditions that turn Tasmania into a tinderbox will become more common. Tasmanian author Richard Flanagan said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Tasmania's world heritage area was our Great Barrier Reef, and, like the Great Barrier Reef, it seemed doomed by climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Flanagan points out:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Climate change isn't just happening. It's happening far quicker than has been predicted. Each careful scientific prediction is rapidly overtaken by the horror of profound natural changes that seem to be accelerating, with old predictions routinely outdone by the worsening reality—hotter, colder, wetter, drier, windier, wilder, and ever more destructive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania's iconic leatherwood honey industry has been destroyed as part of this as well. Even before the fires, these unprecedented temperatures had already dried the flowers of Tasmania's native leatherwood trees, unique to our island and found only in the cold and remote wilderness currently ablaze in the Gell River, Tahune and West Coast fires. The hives have now been burnt, and in the sad words of Tasmanian Beekeepers Association Vice-President, Peter Norris:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Leatherwood doesn't handle fire, it takes a couple of hundred years to come back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">      …      …      …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We're never going to see it recover—once it's gone, it's gone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meeting the challenge of future wildfire in Tasmania is a matter not just for our state, but also for this place. Australia already experiences severe problems with wildfire, coastal and river management, and flooding and drought, and yet we're only at the beginning of runaway climate change. The 2018 Red Cross World Disasters Report ranked Australia 10th in the world for the cost of damage caused by disasters between 2008 and 2017, with a disaster damage bill of $38 billion. The damage these more-regular extreme-weather events keep delivering will demand money and time to rebuild, while also devastating productivity as higher average temperatures and lower rainfall smash our agricultural production.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone knows that there needs to be action and that action should have should have started years ago—but we really need it now. That's why we do need bipartisan action from federal and state politicians to try and meet or mitigate this threat. Everyone knows that Labor is committed to cutting our carbon pollution by 45 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030 and to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. But at this moment in time it is important to recognise how communities have come together in times of crisis, as we have seen in Tasmania, and the resilience of communities. I thank every remote area firefighter who kept fighting those fires beyond exhaustion in conditions beyond imagination; every volunteer firefighter who worked day in and day out on the front line and behind fire fronts to help and protect Tasmanian communities; and every person in those communities impacted by the firestorm who have faced this disaster with courage and resilience.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="76760" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:41</span>):  I rise today to comment on the government's response, tabled outside of sittings last December, to the report <span style="font-style:italic;">Value and affordability of private health</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> insurance</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> and out-of-pocket medical costs</span>. First, it has taken a full year for the government to respond to this very important inquiry. This is surprising when you note that the report was supported by the majority of committee members, that there were no dissenting reports and that governments senators only provided additional comments to the report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inquiries and their resultant recommendations are undertaken to inform the parliament, and particularly the government, when there is a breakdown in service provision or delivery, or a need to improve regulations or legislation for the betterment of the community. It is our duty as elected members of parliament to pay attention to their findings and to act on them where appropriate. Reports are not meant to gather dust in a minister's office or to be brushed off with a simple 'The government notes these recommendations,' which, as we all know, usually means no further action will be taken unless there is pressure to do so. This government's response to these recommendations is very much in the 'brushed off' category, despite the government's initial work to reform private health and its embryonic effects on fee transparency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I refer to some of their responses, it's important to note that, as a policy area, both parties over recent years have done very little to rein in the ever increasing costs of private health. Private health insurance premiums have increased by an average of 5.35 per cent since 2000, more than twice the rate of CPI and almost double that of wage growth. Government spin claims that in the past two years premium increases have been the lowest in a decade. I accept that claim on face value, but point out that the increases are still more than double that of inflation and wage growth. In other words, government has, through regulated increases, actually sanctioned increasing the cost burden of private health insurance on ordinary Australians. No wonder so many Australians are dropping out. The level of downgraded cover and dropout numbers is the highest we've seen in a decade, and this has occurred at a time when many insurers enjoy record profit margins, some with returns on equity that are more than double those of the banks. One of the largest insurers, Bupa, is even on the ATO list as a significant risk for tax evasion from transfer pricing. What does that tell us? It tells us that, irrespective of what we are told, private health insurance for some is a licence to print money. The opposition also has failed to grasp the opportunity for significant reform. Its approach—to cap premium growth to two per cent a year—will only lead to insurers closing unprofitable policies and further drops in the level of cover. Nothing good will come from their cost reduction method either.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry heard from insurers, hospitals, clinicians, patients, community groups and the Department of Health. It found glaring problems with anticompetitive behaviour by the large health funds with respect to individual providers. It found many private hospitals enjoy record net operating margins of 10 per cent or more. And it found that there had been no effort from either the government or the opposition to bring the private hospital system under the watchful eye of the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry also heard that 70 per cent of costs associated with private health are spent on private hospitals, with doctors and prosthesis costs each representing just 15 per cent. The health minister's response to this report failed to make even a single statement regarding improving the efficiency of private hospitals. Private hospitals have enjoyed record profit margins, with Ramsay Health Care, the largest operator, having increased its share price 25 times over the last two decades—what a stellar record, very much at the expense of the privately-insured public. Day surgery, which is the largest growth area for private hospitals, has net operating margins—just think about this—of 20 per cent. Yet the government has chosen not to accept the recommendations of the inquiry that private hospitals and day surgeries should also be included in the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority's analysis of hospital pricing. What is the government frightened of? What is the opposition frightened of? Upsetting donors or future employers or future consultancy opportunities? It does make you wonder, when no action is being taken against the category that represents the biggest costs yet the highest profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, to some of the specific recommendations. Recommendations 2 and 3 of the report relate to transparency, requiring private health insurers to publish rebates by policy and item number, and for the Department of Health to publish medical practitioner fees in a searchable database. Transparency was very much a key outcome of the inquiry and this is an area that I am focused on more broadly. Improving transparency of medical costs, practitioner performance and health outcomes is ambitious yet vital. It is potentially the biggest game-changer for consumers. When it comes to fees and gaps, consumers are confused and find it difficult to determine benefit levels in an easy, understandable way. Medical practitioner fees vary substantially and are often not fully known until a patient receives their bill. Late last year the government received recommendations from the ministerial advisory committee on out-of-pocket costs, which was tasked with modelling ways to make out-of-pocket costs transparent for consumers. However, it has yet to publish these recommendations, much less act on them. The government has dodged the issue of publicly publishing policy benefit rates by using commercial-in-confidence excuses—what a cop out. The PHI funds are backed by $6.3 billion in taxpayer-funded rebates. There should be no excuses for failing to clearly state what rebate is paid for each item number and outed on a publicly searchable website.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 4 of the report relates to auditing the much-trumpeted reduction in the prosthesis list cost to ensure savings have indeed been passed on to consumers. The government's response is that it supports this in principle, but there is no pathway or commitment at this stage to on act it. Recommendation 11 covers paediatric dentistry. The committee heard from paediatric dentists about the issues associated with providing dental care in hospitals for children requiring anaesthesia and sedation. The government states this is a strictly private commercial arrangement and has lost sight of the fact that this is a failed market, where all the power is on the side of the insurers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 12 seeks to prohibit the practice of differential rebates for the same treatment—that is, where a consumer is paid a different rebate according to where they live or where their procedure was undertaken. This is despite the fact that they pay the same premium as everybody else and that the same insurance product is what they have taken. The government states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Consumers are free to choose a private health insurance policy that pays a set benefit regardless of provider, and many insurers offer such products.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What it ignores is the fact that there is no one location for consumers to discover what insurers offer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 17 was mirrored in the dissenting report by government senators. It relates to a reasonable period of notice for policy changes. By rejecting this recommendation, the government has chosen to leave consumers at the mercy of insurers, who can change their policy and coverage with as little as 60 days notice, leaving consumers who have commenced or have planned to commence treatment floundering. This is a poor position for consumers, and one I and the committee would have thought would not have been strongly supported by government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All-up, out of the 19 recommendations, government agreed to just five, or a little over a quarter. It outright rejected a further five and noted a further nine, which likely means no action will be taken on them. This was a very important inquiry, and I sincerely implore this government or the next to review and reconsider the recommendations which have been noted or rejected, to ensure the public receives the best possible, most affordable and most transparent private health care possible.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="237920" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:51</span>):  I was sad to hear of the passing of former Nationals MP Paul Neville at the start of this year. Mr Neville was one of the greats—a true gentleman with a wicked sense of humour. Neville entered parliament in 1993, the member for Hinkler. He was appointed Nationals Whip in 1998. He would go on to be one of Australia's longest-serving party whips and one of the longest-serving parliamentarians in the Wide Bay region, leaving on his own terms when he decided not to recontest election in 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of Neville's greatest achievements were in the area of media and telecommunications. He was passionate about maintaining diversity in regional media content and in ownership. He fought to ensure continued access to vital communications services in rural and regional areas throughout his parliamentary career. In 1999, he was the first person to mention in parliament the tiny rural town of Ubobo, which was fighting Telstra's decision to remove its one and only payphone. This small story hit national headlines—a symbol, Neville said, of a growing problem right around Australia of stripping essential services from regional areas. In the end, Neville and Ubobo won, and they got to keep their phone box. He won a lot of battles in that same humble, grassroots, local way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Neville was very close to his electorate and he knew the fishing and sugarcane industries inside out. He would always listen to what the electorate had to say, whether it was about a little phone box in Ubobo or larger transport or health issues, and he would always bring people's concerns right to his colleagues. He was known as one of the greatest contributors to debate in the party room. His Nationals colleague and good friend Ron Boswell shared an anecdote with me that I think encapsulates this quality of Neville's. Back during the Howard government, Treasury proposed to reduce the required maturation point of Bundaberg Rum. You see, the longer rum was left to mature in the keg, the less the Treasury could collect in excise, so they wanted to get it out sooner rather than later. Neville led the charge to stop this money grab. He was outraged. He asked then Treasurer Peter Costello how on earth, as a fellow member of parliament, he could possibly contemplate opposing the most iconic thing to come from his electorate. Ultimately, Costello agreed, and the vote was shelved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former member for Wide Bay, Warren Truss, tells another story, of the time Neville stepped off a plane in Bundaberg. Everyone around him started spontaneously clapping. He looked around, wondering who it was for. It was his constituents applauding him for standing up to his then party leader at the time and refusing to support a bill that he knew his electorate wouldn't stand for. And that really speaks to the core of Neville's character: a parliamentarian who always put the wishes of local people first and expected no special treatment for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be remiss to talk about Neville and not mention his skills as a raconteur. He was famous for it and always had a funny story to tell. If you ever need to get a good sense of Neville's humour and a good laugh for yourself, have a read of the story he tells in his valedictory speech about his chat with an RAAF officer and their discussion on how airmen handle fatigue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vale, Paul Neville. Your passion, your kindness and your jokes will be remembered by all of us for many years to come, though we know you'll be sorely missed by Margaret and the rest of your family and, I suspect, the people of Hinkler. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:55</span>):  I would like to take this opportunity to speak about the Murray-Darling Basin—a subject of vital importance to South Australia and Australia generally. By way of introduction, I want to recall a cautionary tale from my state's history. Melrose is the oldest town in South Australia's Flinders Ranges. If you drive a bit north of the town, on the edge of the barren Willochra Plain, you can find a monument commemorating Goyder's Line of 1865. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who don't know the story, in 1865 South Australian Surveyor General, George Goyder, was asked by the South Australian government to map the boundary between districts suitable for agriculture and those prone to drought. After travelling some 3,200 kilometres on horseback, Goyder produced a report and a map with a line of demarcation between the northern areas he judged liable to drought and suitable only for grazing and areas to the south suitable for wheat and other crops. Goyder's approach was carefully scientific, including close observations of changes in vegetation, especially the prevalence of various types of saltbush. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the basis of Goyder's line, the South Australian government initially discouraged agricultural settlement in the state's north. However, a few good seasons of rain fuelled political pressure to open new areas for settlement and farmers were allowed to move north, planting wheat in anticipation of more good seasons. Early crops were good, but a few years later the rain reverted to its normal pattern. Severe drought forced the abandonment of hundreds of farms. Farmers and their families faced great hardship and were forced to retreat, leaving ruins scattered across the Willochra Plain and elsewhere in South Australia's north. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story of Goyder's Line has been told to successive generations of South Australian school students as a lesson about the realities of climate change and the dangers of pushing the environmental envelope in the hope of profit. More than 150 years after Goyder drew his line, Royal Commissioner Bret Walker has delivered another salutary warning about Australia's environment and the dangers of narrow commercial interest prevailing over environmental realities. Over more than 700 pages of his report, Commissioner Walker has drawn up a scathing indictment of maladministration, unlawful action and political interference in the management of the water resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commissioner found that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has ignored the potentially catastrophic risk of climate change. Good science has been pushed aside by narrow self-interests, both political and economic. The royal commissioner has condemned the so-called triple bottom line approach through which the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and basin governments have weighed economic and social factors to radically reduce water recovery for the environment. Not only has this process lacked transparent scientific foundation; it is at odds with the Commonwealth Water Act 2007, which requires that the basin's water resources be managed in the national interest and, among other things, protect, restore and provide for the Murray-Darling ecosystem. I emphasise the word 'restore' because, when this parliament passed the Water Act, it legislated that the Murray-Darling system had to be restored, not merely maintained in an environmentally degraded status quo. Commissioner Walker has recommended a complete overhaul of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Large-scale water buybacks and a consequent reduction in irrigation, especially in the northern basin, are essential to restoring the river system. Of course, during the summer we've all seen the appalling fish kills on the lower Darling River.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against a background of obvious environmental crisis, a crisis in which communities have been unable to access safe drinking water, one might have thought the royal commissioner's report would receive a positive response or at least trigger constructive debate about water management reform. Regrettably, the New South Wales and Queensland governments have effectively rejected the report and its recommendations out of hand. The Australian government appears indifferent, while the South Australian government's response has been low key to the point of timidity. We have a merry-go-round of blame shifting, taking the Murray-Darling Basin absolutely nowhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In these circumstances it is, regrettably, necessary to open debate on other, unpalatable measures to protect and restore the environmental health of the Murray-Darling. In this, the role of cotton cannot be ignored. The overwhelming majority, 98 per cent, of cotton is grown in the Murray-Darling Basin, with some 90 per cent exported, mainly to China and India. This is a large and successful industry but one that imposes a major drain on the—</span>

Noting that cotton is a water-intensive crop, we are effectively exporting 20 per cent of our river, something that makes no sense for the driest inhabited continent on the planet.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator PATRICK:</span>
                  </a>  I do so, Minister, on the basis that you can't cherrypick; you can't simply take one part of the royal commissioner's recommendations and say, 'That's what he said.' You have to look at the document in its entire context. Please—we can't cherrypick.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the absence of following the royal commissioner's recommendations, or any other national or state commitments to implementing the commissioner's recommendations, that's precisely what we must do. Restoring the environmental health of our rivers, guaranteeing water security and food production, must be our national priority, not cotton exports. Consequently, Centre Alliance has moved to introduce legislation to ban cotton. Our aim is to open critical debate on the future of the cotton industry in the Murray-Darling Basin. Unsurprisingly, our initiative has been greeted with outrage. Long-serving Cotton Australia Chief Executive, Adam Kay, declared we are engaged in a dangerous and outrageous political attack. National Party politicians in New South Wales and Queensland denounced what they claim to be a South Australian assault on cotton producers. The list of critics includes the federal Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud; the New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries, Niall Blair; and the New South Wales MPs Mark Coulton, Austin Evans and Scot MacDonald. All this is unsurprising. They are, after all, lobbyists for the cotton industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Faced with an export ban, some cotton farmers would shift production to other irrigated crops. Overall, however, it can be anticipated that ending the cotton export market would result in significant reductions in demand on basin water resources. Of course, if basin governments were able to come together and agree on real reforms based on transparent science, as recommended by the royal commissioner, the cotton ban proposed in the bill that we'll introduce tomorrow would be unnecessary. In the absence of such action, the environmental degradation of the Murray-Darling Basin system will continue. It may well become Australia's equivalent of the Aral Sea, and calls for action, most likely focused on the industry, will most likely grow. Royal Commissioner Walker, like Surveyor-General Goyder 150 years ago, has offered good advice based on science that warns about pushing the environmental limits in a country characterised by drought and finite water resources. If we don't act, someone may well end up putting up another monument, perhaps the Bret Walker monument, this time near another South Australian town, Goolwa, saying, 'The Murray River once flowed to the sea near here.' That would be a great tragedy. </span>

                  <a href="192970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:05</span>):  I rise to speak tonight on an issue that I think is emblematic of the struggle of communities in being heard by politicians in this place against the interests of big corporates. It's something that unfortunately this parliament doesn't talk a lot about. Certainly it's something that the Greens have tried to talk about a lot and have sought to introduce legislation on many, many times, but we're yet to receive support from either of the large parties. It's unconventional gas and fracking for unconventional gas. It is still, and has been for ten years now, threatening our best food-producing land, of course on top of climate change, which is the other threat to our food-producing land. It flies in the face of the science and it flies in the face of protecting that precious food-producing land. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that Australia is the driest inhabited continent on the planet and we have some of the worst soil on the planet, surely our food-producing land should be off limits for mining and gas activities. But the mining and gas companies make massive donations to both sides of politics, so naturally they get to write their own rules. I was reflecting on the history of this issue earlier today. It's been 7½ years since I first raised this issue in the Senate. I introduced a bill to give landholders the right to say no to coal seam gas mines and coalmines on their land. This is primarily to protect food-producing land, to protect the rights of traditional owners and to make sure that our water table—water being our most precious resource in this country—isn't going to be contaminated by those fracking chemicals which are blasted through aquifers to break open coal seams to extract the gas because this government doesn't realise that renewables can do the job. It's 7½ years on and we still don't have any decent laws to protect the community, our farmland, our water or our climate from the impacts of coal seam gas, shale and tight gas. Collectively, we call that unconventional gas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I introduced that first bill back in July 2011. It got voted down. I introduced it again in 2013, from memory. It got voted down. I introduced it again in 2015. We haven't been able to bring that on for a final vote yet. It's very convenient for the big parties to make sure it can't come on for a vote, because they still support this industry. I am incredibly disappointed that our state administration, just last week, has been trumpeting the release of more precious land for gas companies, most of them multinational gas companies, many of whom make large donations to both sides of politics. The state government has been trumpeting the release of more land to be opened up for fracking. It seems that they've learned nothing from the science. It seems they continue to ignore the pleas of the community across Queensland, who are sick of the health impacts; who are sick of the intrusion on their way of life and onto their land; who are sick of their groundwater bores dropping, sometimes by up to hundreds of metres; and who are sick of being ripped off by these companies that they don't have the right to say no to who are trampling all over their land. So it beggars belief that we still have bipartisan support for the dangerous, experimental fossil fuel industry that is gas fracking for unconventional gas, much of which is for export in any case. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Greens know that we don't have alternatives to food or water, but we have a multitude of alternatives for energy sources. We know that clean energy is more job intensive, will help us address climate change and won't threaten our food-producing land. But it's no coincidence that the renewable energy industry and, indeed, the farmers aren't making the big donations that the coal seam gas and other fossil fuel industries are making. We just did the figures, because the new donations data was released last week. Five million dollars went to both sides of politics over the last four years from fossil fuel companies, including coal seam gas and unconventional gas companies. That clearly has bought the support of both parties, because there's never been an unconventional gas application rejected by the federal government, no matter which party has been in power. All of those proposals have been waved through; they've been approved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I still remember back when we were fighting to get protection for water into our federal environmental laws. That was in August 2011, a few months after I began the role of speaking for the community in Queensland. It then took another couple of years for us to convince one of the big parties—it was Labor in government at the time—to bring in that water trigger. We welcomed that. It wasn't as strong as we wanted, but it was certainly a step forward. But the tragedy at that time was that, about two weeks before they legislated the water trigger, the environment minister at the time ticked off on two of the big coal seam gas proposals. It was very convenient that they didn't have to consider the water impacts before approving these developments for companies that, incidentally, had made donations. Then two weeks later Labor decided, 'Oh, we'll tighten up the laws now.' Again, it's a very cosy relationship that we see between the gas companies and both sides of politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might think that the community would lose heart given the consistent approach of parliament ignoring their needs and the big parties not listening to their concerns, but Queenslanders and Australians are strong. We are resilient and we're fighters. We don't give up. Tonight I wanted to pay tribute to the strength of those communities. Despite having their health impacted, their very ways of life being impacted, often their farm profitability impacted and their groundwater level impacted, despite facing all of these personal impacts on a daily basis from this industry—and I include in that, sadly, the loss of some family members and, in particular, I want to mention the Bender family, who lost their father, George, several years ago after the stress of dealing with one of these companies—and despite all of the threats that these communities face and the pressure that's been brought to bear on them, they are still strong and they are still fighting this industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lock the Gate have been a real lightning rod in this regard. They started in Queensland—I'm very proud of that—and they've sprung up as a national movement to give voice to those communities who just want to keep farming their land and growing food for all of us, who just want their kids to have the opportunity to continue in their footsteps, who just want to make sure that they can continue to live their lives and not be bullied by these big, often multinational corporations that have bought off the big parties and are treating these communities like dirt, like they have no rights. Of course, sadly, the law says they don't have those rights because this parliament has not passed my bill to give those communities rights to say no to those coal and coal seam gas companies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know those communities won't give up fighting and neither will we. It's been 7½ years now that we've been trying to get legislation to give these communities rights to protect their farmland. We got success on that water trigger bill, and we will not give up trying to make sure that people can protect the land on which they grow all of our food. Of course, they export some of that food, too. This is simply a message of thanks to those communities that continue to stand strong against the pressure, the bullying and the awfulness of what this industry has been subjecting them to for years. And it's once again a call to the big parties to please stop letting the dirty donations that flow into your re-election coffers cloud your judgement. Please stop letting those donations get in the way of listening to what the community is calling for you to do—that is to protect their land, to safeguard their future, to protect the water that we all rely upon and to make sure that we've got community cohesion and a parliament that works for people, listens to the community and represents their interests. Surely that's what we're meant to be doing here in this place?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we won't stop talking about this. We've got an election coming up, folks. I hope to still be talking about this issue in the next term of parliament, but, if I'm not, there will be other Greens in this place that will continue to talk about coal seam gas and unconventional gas. We will proudly continue to be the voice for communities against multinational fossil fuel companies that want to pillage their land because they've made very big donations to the major parties and bought the policy outcomes that suit their corporate profits, but rip off and ignore communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I look forward to continuing the work that we started 7½ years ago. I do hope that, ultimately, we see some success here, because communities deserve that. They deserve decent representation, and our democracy deserves to be run by people, not by the interests of big donors. We saw in the donations data released on 1 February the extent of corporate influence over our democracy. It's no wonder that the Australian community is fed up with politicians. They don't feel listened to anymore, because they can see that big money is influencing both of the big parties. So not only do we want to clean up those donations laws but we want to give communities the ability to protect their food-producing land, to protect the water and climate that we all rely on and to just get on with living their life growing our food.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:15</span>):  I found last week pretty difficult. We had two full days of hearings into the proposed legislation to end discrimination in schools, the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Removing Discrimination Against Students) Bill 2018. Our inquiry heard and the submissions outlined story after story about the damage being done to LGBTIQ people—young and old, students and staff—through ongoing discrimination against them in some faith based schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard stories like that from a teacher at a Christian School. The teacher, working in a learning support role, shared their experience of a young student who was bullied because they were perceived to be gay. He was a boy in year 5 who had started to think and write about his attraction to boys, who was told by his bullies that being gay was demonic, that God hated him and that he was going to hell. When questioned by the teacher, the bully said, 'We were just telling him what the Bible says, and it's what God says.' On one occasion when crossing a road one student said to the boy that he should stay on the road and get run over and die because he was gay and God hated him. The student froze and had to be pulled off the road by one of his friends. The teacher logged an incident report but was later told that it had been lost, so there was no record. The boy tried to harm himself. Again he was told he was going to hell and was possessed by a demon. The teacher persisted in writing up incident reports after each incident. Eventually the bullies were suspended, but the victim was being treated as though he was the real problem, and the teacher was warned against 'overstepping my role'. The teacher then told of coming to terms with their own sexuality at the same time as this was happening, acknowledging that they could not safely tell anyone at the school. They eventually had their position at the school cut. They write: 'So far as I'm aware I lost my job not because I was gay; I lost my job just for trying to ensure a safe environment for my gay students.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard of a second boy, a 12-year-old, who had a very outgoing, flamboyant personality and was a talented singer and actor. Over the course of the year, the student was getting more and more negative attention from his class teachers and senior staff over issues like his attitude and emotionality and was the target of some verbal homophobic bullying from other students. One day his teacher found him curled up on the floor, sobbing and shaking, behind a door: 'He told me that another teacher had said that he didn't like the way he talked.' This teacher had said to his student: 'You disgust me.' The boy described feeling angry and confused because he didn't know how to be a different person from who he was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is absolutely heartbreaking. No person, let alone a 12-year-old, should ever be made to feel ashamed of who they are, and no person, let alone a child, should ever experience this harassment, bullying and shaming behaviour anywhere in society, let alone in a school and let alone from a teacher. The teacher said, 'Schools like my former workplace rely on the exemptions, not necessarily directly, to expel students or sack staff, but indirectly, to legitimate their poor treatment of LGBT students and staff.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During our inquiry, we considered the government's proposed amendments to the removing discrimination against students bill. If these amendments were adopted, they would further entrench the rights of religious schools to discriminate against LGBTIQ+ students, staff and teachers. Our Greens amendments, in contrast, would remove discrimination against staff as well as students, because otherwise schools will continue to be unsafe places for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender diverse and queer students, teachers and other staff. LGBTIQ people should not walk through the school gates every morning and wonder if they'll be marched out by the afternoon just because of who they are. The Greens believe that religious schools should be able to teach according the doctrines of their faith, but not in a way that causes harm to LGBTIQ+ people. We know that it's possible for faith based schools to teach their faith and not discriminate against same-sex attracted and gender-diverse people, because this is how it's been in Tasmania and Queensland for decades. The rest of Australia needs to catch up. It's time to remove all discrimination in our schools. We can and we must—no ifs, no buts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at the huge 'Stop Adani' rally out the front of Parliament House this morning, and I'll be at the forest rally out the front tomorrow. We have millions of young people all over the world marching, protesting and making their voices heard for action on climate change and for action to protect nature and our life support systems from the blow after blow of fires, floods, fish kills, coral bleaching and flying foxes literally falling dead out of the sky in their tens of thousands after the furnace of a supercharged hot day. Australia is in the grip of an extinction crisis. We have the worst mammal extinction rate in the world. Let that sink in. We are the second worst in the world for total biodiversity loss, beaten only by Indonesia. And it's only getting worse, with ongoing habitat destruction through logging and land clearing and ongoing climate change from the burning of coal and gas and oil. We have 477 animals on our national threatened and endangered species list, including the critically endangered Leadbeater's possum in Victoria and the critically endangered swift parrot in Tasmania, with fewer than 2,000 left in the wild. Even our beloved koala, a global icon, is predicted to become extinct in New South Wales if the current trajectory of habitat destruction continues. This is a tragedy unfolding before our very eyes and a tragedy that is entirely preventable. We have utterly weak federal environment laws that are failing to protect nature, and we have the Labor, Liberal and National parties standing by as the precious natural places that provide homes for our threatened animals get destroyed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm currently chairing a Senate inquiry into Australia's animal extinction crisis. We've seen and heard horrifying evidence of environmental destruction. At the Tasmanian hearings last week, we heard explosive testimony from Dr Matthew Webb, a scientist at the ANU who had previously worked in the Tasmanian state government. He told us:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There's this very, very strong top-down political pressure on the people remaining within government to approve whatever these developments or logging operations are, and it's very difficult for anyone to give really honest, clear advice anymore … because, quite frankly, if you have kids and a mortgage, you need to keep your job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When asked whether he was suggesting that public servants are compromising their advice because they're worried about losing their jobs, Dr Webb replied, 'Most certainly.' At the Melbourne hearings last year, we heard staggering testimony regarding the forest task force that the Andrews government in Victoria set up before the 2014 elections as an election promise. The purpose of the task force was to find a way forward that would protect precious areas of forest in the Great Forest National Park and other reserves while giving certainty to industry. Cut to after the election: the task force made up of environmentalists, industry and unions laboured for well over a year but in the end was disbanded without resolution. Our inquiry learned that Premier Andrews broke his election promise, because VicForests, the state owned logging company, got their way. VicForests would not have been able to fulfil their future contracts if the parks were declared, so the logging destroying critical natural habitat continues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think our federal environment laws would be able to override something so destructive as logging and woodchipping—but no. Logging done under the regional forest agreements is effectively exempt from our national environment laws. When will the Labor-Liberal-National parties sit up and take notice that our very future is on the brink? It's astounding and appalling that a country as wealthy as ours is robbing future generations of their chance to know and love our nature and wildlife.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been so inspired by the young people I've met who are involved in politics and protest for nature and for climate. For their sake, we need action to protect our future now—not after the next election, not in a year or five or 10 years but now!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:25</span>):  I rise tonight to pay tribute to Professor Paul Kerin. Sadly, Professor Kerin passed away on 30 December last year. Paul was an economist, an adviser, a mediator, a media commentator and a champion for those less well off in our community. His passion for social justice started at a very young age. Although Dr Kerin had a highly successful career in business and academia, tonight I would like to focus on the enormous contribution Paul made to a number of South Australian and national disability and not-for-profit organisations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Paul was a type 1 diabetic, his involvement in Diabetes SA, including serving on its board, was not surprising. Family experience and friendship also led Paul to become an adviser to and eventually a board member of Down Syndrome South Australia. Prior to joining the board of Down Syndrome South Australia, Dr Kerin was a member of their governance advisory committee and provided strong advice and assistance which was invaluable in meeting the many challenges membership based disability organisations faced with the rollout of the NDIS. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a board member of Down Syndrome South Australia, Paul helped shape the board's focus on their long-term financial sustainability. That sustainability is vital for any organisation seeking to meet the ongoing needs of their membership. Being an economist, Dr Kerin was adamant that sustainability needed to be a longer term view than the traditional six- to 12-month funding cycle. Apart from the fact that this represented good governance, in Paul's view a longer term sustainable financial outcome was necessary to attract and retain the best possible staff and to ensure quality and guaranteed support to members and their families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul wasn't on the board of Down Syndrome South Australia for long before he took on the role of representing South Australia on the board of Down Syndrome Australia. DSA is a relatively young federated organisation, and having some of Professor Kerin's high-powered business and commercial experience, along with his governance expertise and fierce intellect, would have been invaluable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul's involvement with and commitment to Down Syndrome South Australia saw him suggest an amalgamation with the Adelaide based service provider, Orana. After a significant process of evaluation and due diligence reviews on both sides, along with consultations with the Down Syndrome South Australia membership, the amalgamation proceeded last year. The merger was seen as beneficial to both organisations. Orana was able to provide Down Syndrome SA the financial stability Paul regarded as essential and with statewide reach, and the lively mixture of members and volunteers of Down Syndrome South Australia will help modernise the operations of Orana and introduce them to a new generation of South Australians that need their support. This amalgamation saw Paul leave the board of Down Syndrome Australia. He took a seat on the board of Orana on behalf of Down Syndrome SA. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul was a lifelong supporter of many charities, but Diabetes SA and Down Syndrome SA held a special place. In addition to the charities and organisations that Paul supported both personally and financially, economics, music, family and friends were important to Paul. In addition to expressing my condolence to the membership of Down Syndrome South Australia and Down Syndrome Australia, I would like to take this opportunity to pass on my sympathies to Paul's sons, Jack and Alex, and his close friends and family.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:30</span>):  I've spoken before in this place about the very great problem experienced by many small businesses, particularly in the building industry, in the form of phoenix companies. This involves the deliberate burning of companies by company directors in order to avoid paying debts to their creditors. It's particularly rife in the building industry and even more so on the Gold Coast, where my electorate office is based. This is an issue I've pursued vigorously in the Senate in estimates and in the public domain—particularly on the Gold Coast because we've seen far too many company collapses on the Gold Coast, where innocent building subcontractors and suppliers have been left with tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills unpaid. Not surprisingly, on many occasions, that leaves the subcontractors themselves facing bankruptcy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've met families who have been literally been broken up by the unpaid debts of developers and building companies who choose to burn their companies and send them insolvent rather than pay their debts, only to go and set up in another company form down the track to do it all over again, which is exactly why they're referred to as phoenix companies. Some of the most prominent examples on the Gold Coast have involved the Cullen Group, Q1 Homes and many other examples. Unfortunately this is a problem we're seeing well beyond the Gold Coast. Late last year we saw the collapse of a large building company based in Rockhampton, JN Kelly. We've even seen this form of phoenixing and corporate misconduct inflict pain on building subcontractors on Commonwealth-funded projects—for example, the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing Road and the Amberley air base redevelopment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to the efforts of a number of groups, including building trade unions and Subbies United, who have done a lot of work to recover monies owed to subcontractors and to put this issue on the agenda. It's largely as a result of the work that those groups have done that many of the regional papers in Queensland over the last week or so have been giving this issue the coverage that it deserves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this is an issue I've raised in this chamber before, and also at Senate estimates. Last year I asked a number of questions of ASIC executives to try to get to the bottom of what they've actually done about this problem, and I have to say that I found their evidence very underwhelming. It was clear that they haven't taken this issue seriously. Unfortunately, we can put this alongside the misconduct we've seen in the banking industry; it's another area where ASIC dropped the ball and innocent people have felt the consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the attention this issue is now getting from media outlets in Queensland. I also welcome action that the state Labor government, Annastacia Palaszczuk's government, has taken to try to protect the interests of subbies, particularly in relation to projects funded by the state government. In doing so, they had to reverse a lot of changes that had been made by the Newman LNP government which opened the door to building subbies and other suppliers being done over in this manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the one group that is not taking action, despite all of this publicity and all of these corporate collapses we're seeing, is this LNP federal government. I want to particularly call out the lack of action by the LNP members of parliament on the Gold Coast. Every single federal seat on the Gold Coast is held by the LNP. We hear day in and day out how they care about small businesses on the Gold Coast and across Australia. Here is a good example of an issue where small businesses are actually being hurt by larger businesses, and the LNP is doing nothing about it. Over the last 12 months, Labor has outlined a range of commitments, after consultation with the industry, that we believe will make a significant difference to the lives these building subbies, ranging from requiring company directors to obtain director ID numbers so that they can be tracked to prevent this kind of phoenixing, to increasing the penalties that are imposed on phoenix companies and their directors. These are sensible proposals that we have being calling on the government to follow us on for months now. Yet we are still waiting, and therefore we are still seeing subbies go to the wall. It's time that the LNP actually delivered on their claims that they care about small business. Stand with Labor and protect these subbies from going under.</span>
