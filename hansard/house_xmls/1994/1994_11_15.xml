         —The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) is the principal bill of this package of taxation bills before the House. The measures contained in the other four bills in the package mostly follow up on changes to be enacted by the primary bill. The Income Tax (Former Complying Superannuation Funds) Bill imposes tax on the net previous income of superannuation funds that change their status from complying to non-complying. The Income Tax (Former Non-resident Superannuation Funds) Bill imposes tax on the net previous income of superannuation funds that change their status from non-resident to resident.

         The Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill amends the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to reduce the threshold at which the income of a medium sized credit union is subject to tax. This bill enacts a small technical correction. Section 23(6) of the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 limits the amount of tax payable by a medium sized credit union. This is calculated by reference to a threshold amount currently set at $50,000. This bill reduces this amount to $49,999 to bring it into line with the threshold for medium credit unions which is set out in the Income Tax Assessment Act. The Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Bill imposes a deficit deferral tax designed to pick up tax that the amendments to the imputation provisions contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) would otherwise allow to escape.

         There are a number of positive developments in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) which the coalition  endorses. The coalition welcomes the move to provide a deduction for successful cash bids for offshore and onshore mineral exploration authorities and mining authorities, and for onshore petroleum exploration permits and production licences. The coalition supports the government's move to relieve from a higher tax impost income derived from the investment of property transferred to a child as part of a legal settlement in relation to family breakdown and the move to tighten up the anti-avoidance provisions in relation to children's income in situations of family breakdown. We also support the move to pay interest on the overpayment of income tax and the early payment of income tax.

         The coalition does not oppose the measures contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) relating to credit unions, pooled development funds, research and development activities, the rates of interest for calculating the superannuation guarantee charge, and the development allowance. The deficit deferral tax imposed by the Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Bill is a consequence of changes to the instalment arrangements for the payment of company tax. The arrangements are complex and may well give rise to technical problems. However, some mechanism is needed so that the introduction of this system does not open a hole in the tax system.

         Apart from these measures, however, there are a number of disturbing features contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) which are a matter of grave concern to the coalition. The bill proposes to amend section 82AAQ of the Income Tax Assessment Act so that an employer who has obtained deductions in respect of contributions to a superannuation fund on behalf of employees is taxed on any amounts that are repaid by the fund as surplus. It is understandable to tax as income the return of moneys for which a tax deduction has been obtained. However, the amendments are proposed to apply from 1 July 1988. Retrospective taxes are odious and, in principle, wrong.

         The government has displayed masterly inactivity on this issue. If this loophole has existed since 1988, it is culpable negligence to have left it until 1994 before rectifying it. It is the government's inaction, despite its clear knowledge of the loophole, which has necessitated measures being imposed retrospectively. The government deserves the strongest condemnation for allowing this situation to develop and allowing it to fester so long.

         However, without these amendments it would be the case that payments of these moneys would have attracted a tax deduction, but repayment would not be assessable.

On this occasion it will pass, but with the strongest possible condemnation. I say this to the negligent government and the negligent administrators of the tax laws in this country: do not push your luck on this kind of situation again.

         The provisions contained in the primary tax bill relating to non-complying superannuation funds are a significant improvement on the government's original draft legislation. Although the proposed new section 288A will go ahead in its original form, the government has made two significant concessions. The Superannuation Industry Supervision Act will be amended to make it much harder for a fund to lose its complying status. Essentially, there will have to be a deliberate contravention on the part of a trustee of a fund, connived at by some or all of the members, before the Insurance and Superannuation Commission will be able to withdraw a fund's complying status. The other concession made is that the implementation of this measure has been delayed from 1994-95 to 1995-96.

         The coalition has some concerns in regard to the proposed changes to superannuation as they relate to overseas employees. The bill does not address the issue of transfers to overseas funds. This aspect should be covered by legislation. The bill exempts from the fringe benefits tax contributions to overseas funds by employers for an employee working in Australia on a temporary entry permit of less than four years. The exemption, however, is restricted to employers who are Australian residents. But there may be a period after arrival when that is not the case.

It is somewhat ironical that, in the same budget in which the Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced the government would be undertaking a review of the fringe benefits tax compliance costs in the light of concern expressed by employers, the government also decided to widen the fringe benefits tax net to include employee share acquisition schemes. This shows the hoax of the proposed review.

         This bill will add another 28 pages of legislation to the FBT Assessment Act. Apparently, the first step in simplifying an act is to add another 28 pages and to extend the net before you ever get around to simplifying it. In the case of these proposed amendments, the government appears to be introducing more legislation which it eventually will refer back to the simplification committee as soon as it is enacted. Be in absolutely no doubt, this is an atrocious piece of added complexity which not in the slightest contributes to simplification.

         The most telling commentary on the fringe benefits tax of late has come from former deputy commissioner of taxation, Mr Ray Conwell.

        When FBT was introduced in 1986 it raised $535 million. In the 1994-95 year, it is budgeted to raise $3.2 billion. I will say that again. When FBT was introduced in 1986 it raised $535 million. In the 1994-95 year, it is budgeted to raise $3.2 billion. It must be said that in some areas the FBT has proved quite a disappointment. The government expected to raise $90 million from FBT on parking. In fact, it will raise only $32 million. Apparently there are now moves afoot in the Treasury to abolish FBT on parking. We will support any such moves.

         The proposal to impose FBT on employee share acquisition schemes is being justified on the basis that some existing schemes are illegitimately avoiding tax. Let us note in passing that the taxation treatment of these schemes has been specifically provided for with its own separate tax regime under section 26AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Let us also note that the current act provides far-reaching anti-avoidance provisions in part IVA. Let us suppose that the government got it wrong on both counts by developing a separate regime under section 26AAC and by allowing it to prosper outside part IVA. Even in these circumstances, circumstances which cannot be shown to apply, there would still be no warrant for attacking all employee acquisition  share schemes. The government has decided to punish all schemes for what it says are the sins of a few.

         On budget night the government's propaganda machine went into overdrive as it presented its changes to employee share acquisition schemes, not as a mechanism which would close down such schemes but as a proposal to encourage them with a tax exemption on up to $500 of share remuneration per year or deferring tax for up to 10 years on up to $1,500 of share remuneration per year. The fact is, however, that despite the propaganda machine the government proposal was to make the schemes far less attractive for employees and to make them much more expensive for employers—taxing companies for the privilege of allocating shares to employees.

         The morning after the budget the headlines heralded a great marketing triumph for the government. The headlines trumpeted: `Workers encouraged to buy shares', `Share scheme for benefit of workers' and `Benefits for employees in new share plans'. One poor journalist was so badly misled by the budget night propaganda that he wrote, `The government has decided to clear the way for wider use of employer share ownership schemes, stealing elements of the policy the coalition took to the last federal election.'

         So what is the government's rationale for imposing the fringe benefits tax on employee share acquisition schemes?

         The government could have addressed the problems, if need be, by amending section 26AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which currently deals with the schemes. The government could have imposed a dollar limit on employee share acquisition schemes. The government could have imposed a limit on the period over which the liability fell due. Of course, such solutions would have been far too simple and far too logical for this government, which is overzealous in prosecuting fringe benefits tax as a milch cow to cover its own wanton expenditure and its own failure to control its own budget deficits.

         The Treasurer, in his press release on Tuesday, was back at it again. In response to my public comment that the coalition would oppose the government's legislation on employee share acquisition schemes, the Treasurer said—to his shame—`It marks a return by the Liberal Party to the days of protecting the tax avoidance industry.' I think it is a little sad that the Treasurer cannot even remember events which he covered in the days when he was the shadow Treasurer, before he was dumped. It was the Fraser government which introduced part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act and which is responsible for the most comprehensive anti-avoidance provisions in this country's history.

         I wonder whether the government remembers its report on national savings by Dr Vince FitzGerald. In discussing the role which business can play in promoting national savings, the report extols the virtue of employee share acquisition schemes as one of the vehicles through which to encourage and assist employees to engage in regular contractual saving. In his report for the Remuneration Planning Corporation, Dr FitzGerald estimated that employee share ownership plans could raise national savings by about half of one per cent of GDP, or around $2 billion in today's dollars, by the end of the decade and increase annual tax revenues permanently by more than $500 million in today's dollars in seven to nine years time. However, the government's moves in extending the FBT to employee share acquisition schemes would destroy the realisation of these potential benefits.

         The coalition supports moves to crack down on abuse and evasion of tax, but that is not the purpose of this bill. This bill's purpose is to impose a fringe benefits tax which will wipe employee share acquisition schemes from the Australian corporate landscape. The coalition believes that there are enormous industrial relations and productivity benefits to be achieved through the extension of employee share acquisition schemes, which are threatened by this legislation. We believe that it is important to give employees a stake in the enterprise they work for, to provide them with encouragement and an incentive to excel in their job and to provide them with an incentive to increase overall productivity.

        The purpose of the ANL Guarantee Bill is to ensure that ANL is able to continue to trade in an orderly fashion, especially during the restructuring process in which the company is currently involved. On 22 August 1994, immediately following the receipt of a due diligence report on ANL which revealed the company was in a difficult financial and trading position, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) announced measures designed to restructure the company and provide it with the opportunity for a viable commercial future.

         One of the measures taken was the appointment of a new board with the specialised skills necessary to undertake the reconstruction task. Another important measure was the announcement, which the Treasurer (Mr Willis) confirmed in writing to ANL, that the government intended to guarantee all existing debts of the company and any further draw-downs required on its promissory note facility. It was recognised as critical to the reconstruction exercise and the company's ongoing operations that ANL's financiers could have complete confidence that their dealings with the company were secure and that the company's operational lines of credit should be maintained.

         This legislation achieves these objectives by providing the Treasurer with the power, required to satisfy section 70B of the Audit Act 1901, to make determinations guaranteeing payments in respect of loans to ANL. Consistent with the announcement of the Minister for Transport, it is envisaged that the exercise of these powers would be limited to guaranteeing ANL's existing debt and promissory note facility. While the legislation does not specifically address the issue of loans to ANL from international financiers, it is intended that this legislation should also enable the provision of guarantees in respect of any such loans.

         I am confident that, in underpinning the restructuring process now under way, this legislation will assist ANL to become a viable, commercial operation. The government appreciates the important contribution an efficient and competitive ANL, and Australian shipping industry as a whole, can make to the Australian economy. In this respect, ANL will be particularly well placed to benefit from initiatives being explored by the government and the maritime unions to improve the competitiveness of Australian shipping by reducing costs and improving efficiency.

         —I am speaking on the ANL Guarantee Bill on behalf of the opposition. It is a very interesting piece of legislation because it is absolutely and totally unnecessary. It is not only unnecessary but a symbol of the way in which this government has been able to, over the course of the last 11 1/2 years, make a complete and utter mess of the management of Australia's national shipping line—our Australian flag carrier—ANL. ANL has never been able to operate properly, like a normal company or in a fashion that one would call sensible and commercial, because this government, over the last 11 1/2 years, has not been able to stop sticking its nose into the business of this commercial enterprise.

         As a consequence of the involvement of this government and in more recent times the current Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), ANL, which is wholly owned by the government of Australia, the taxpayers of this country, is now in a most parlous state and probably the worst position it has ever been in. The jobs of those people who work for the company are in severe jeopardy and Australia's reputation as a reliable and competent shipping nation has been severely harmed. As a consequence of all of this, we now have this bill before us. The bill is before us because this government is incompetent in handling a major commercial enterprise such as ANL.

         The Commonwealth, through this bill, claims that it is guaranteeing all the debts of the company, ANL. The fact is that the Australian government currently owns every one of the shares in ANL. As a consequence of that, it is implicit that any debts that ANL as a company clocks up are therefore debts that this government is responsible for. Purely and simply, the fact that the Commonwealth government owns every single share in ANL is sufficient to guarantee the debts of ANL. We do not need this legislation in order to guarantee the debts of the company. Indeed, this legislation is a complete nonsense. This legislation is again further evidence of the failure of this government to properly handle the affairs of Australian National Line, our national flag carrier.

         This situation finally reached the pinnacle of mismanagement over the last few months when the Minister for Transport went out and held a press conference and said that ANL, which this government had been trying to sell over the last three years, could not be given away. Here is a government trying to sell a wholly owned company and in the process of trying to sell it tells the people of Australia and every potential buyer that you could not give this company away, that the company has a net value of between negative $70 million and negative $117 million. This is sheer lunacy. This is the pinnacle of incompetence and mismanagement of ANL by this government—something that we have become used to.

         The problems of ANL are well known to anybody who has had an interest in it. Everybody knows that because it has been wholly owned by the federal government it has been starved of capital. One of the problems that it has faced over the years has been that when capital injections were required this government was loath to provide them. The question is: what would have been the case if the government had sold ANL some years ago and allowed a private sector owner to own and operate ANL? If that had been the case I dare say ANL's position today would be a darn sight more secure than it currently is. I dare say ANL, which has been traditionally starved of capital over the last 10 or 12 years, would have found itself in a much better capital position with its private sector owner and operator.

         So everything that we see before us today in the bill presented by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is a living example of how this government cannot properly manage a commercial enterprise. It is simply wrong of the Minister for Transport to go out there and state that you could not give away ANL—simply and utterly wrong to say it. It is wrong because it immediately diminishes the value of ANL in the eyes of any intending purchaser and it is also wrong because ANL does have a positive value, as I will demonstrate later.

         Over the course of the last few years this government has been making some rather substantial U-turns in its approach to the management of ANL. I mentioned a few moments ago that back in 1991 the government decided to privatise ANL. Initially, it was to sell 49 per cent of the shareholding of ANL. Between 1991 and August of this year the government changed its position several times on how it would privatise ANL. One minute it was going to be 49 per cent, the next minute perhaps 100 per cent, the next minute it cannot be sold to a foreign buyer, the next minute it can be sold to a foreign buyer. Now we see yet another variation.

         Each and every time the government has stuck its nose into the affairs of ANL it has done it harm.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          If it had gone out there and made a sensible decision and stuck to it, ANL would be in a much better position today. Indeed, the board of ANL, which was given the responsibility of managing this business on a day-to-day basis, was not lacking in competence but was dealing with a most difficult situation. It was confronted with a government, the owner of ANL, that kept on changing its mind. The consequence of that for ANL as a commercial enterprise was that its customers started to wonder what on earth was going to happen with it.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         And not only were its customers starting to wonder, its creditors were also starting to ask questions. Customers were saying, `For goodness sakes, what on earth is happening with ANL? Is it to be sold or is it not? If it is to be sold, to whom? A foreigner, an Australian, or is it to be broken up? What is to happen to it?' So traditional customers of ANL started to look elsewhere for their shipping services. They realised that if they had to sign a contract for a shipping freight rate for the next 12 or 24 months, there was not much point trying to do business with ANL because it may not be in business in a year or two years time. It would be better to get in ahead of the rush and negotiate business with another shipping line.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Of course, this trickled through to the creditors of ANL. The bankers of ANL started to express severe concerns. All of this caused the board a great deal of angst. Over a period of time the board wrote to the various ministers for transport—ministers keep coming and going—expressing their concerns about the privatisation process for ANL. Notwithstanding that, the government could not make up its mind about what it was going to do. Finally, it said, `We are going to leave this whole decision about ANL in the hands of the ALP conference,' which was held in Hobart in September of this year. So we have yet another variation in response to the concerns of the board of ANL, another variation as to the future of ANL.

         It was to be left in the hands of an organisation—the Australian Labor Party—to judge the future of ANL. We must remember that 60 per cent of the voting delegates at the ALP conference were trade union representatives, not parliamentary representatives or members of the Labor Party pure. So all of a sudden this government is handing over one of its major commercial enterprises and its future into the hands of these people to make a judgment. The future of ANL was again left swinging in the breeze.

         In the process of trying to sell ANL, the government had a number of reports on the valuation of ANL undertaken by various firms. Each of those firms produced different results.

         Price Waterhouse and Potter Warburg gave ANL a positive value of anything up to $179 million. Arthur Andersen's valuation, which was commissioned by the board of ANL, gave ANL a positive value of up to $30 million. The board itself was of the view that ANL had a substantial positive value. To justify the claim that the minister made that we could not give ANL away, he chose to select the one and only valuation of ANL which was totally negative—that is, the Price Waterhouse and Salomon Bros report. It indicated that ANL had a value between negative $70 million and negative $117 million.

         We have different positive reports from firms like Arthur Andersen and Potter Warburg and our own Auditor-General, who in the previous October described ANL as a going concern, yet the one that the minister seizes upon is the one that gives the worst possible value for ANL—between minus $70 million and minus $117 million. We have to ask why, when the minister had so many different reports to choose from, did he select this particular one which was by far the worst valuation prepared for ANL? The simple answer is that the privatisation of ANL had become a flag issue for the ALP. ANL, for whatever reasons, has become a holy grail amongst sectors of the Labor Party. I am sure the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) would agree that the privatisation of ANL is a most significant symbolic event for Labor Party people.

         As a consequence, the issue of the privatisation of other federal government facilities like the Federal Airports Corporation has been clouded.

         The way he did that was to find an excuse to pull ANL off the privatisation agenda. What better way to do it than to find a report which stated that ANL could not be given away and, therefore, obviously the right thing for the minister to do was withdraw it from the privatisation debate, remove the potential political embarrassment on the floor of the conference, keep calm those people in the Labor Party who value these things very highly and ensure the passage of other aspects of government privatisation policy such as the privatisation of the Federal Airports Corporation. That ultimately did not go through the way the minister would have liked it to.

         The minister chose the most negative report about ANL's value to solve, for very short-term reasons, a political problem.

The seamen, the clerical staff and the support staff who are part of the ANL organisation have had their long-term job prospects diminished because the Minister for Transport has diminished the value of this organisation and made it less saleable—and, if it is saleable, certainly less valuable.

         However, the story does not finish there. We then discovered that one of the jewels in the crown of ANL—that is, its 25 per cent shareholding in Australian Stevedores, the waterfront operator—had suddenly been sold to Jamison Equity, run by Mr Chris Corrigan. We hear it has been sold for $28 million. Many people in the marketplace say, `$28 million sounds pretty cheap to me considering the return that it is getting from the profits of Australian Stevedores; it seems awfully cheap.'

         We heard in the House last week from the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) that this was a handsome deposit and the rest was just a normal process of settlement at a later date. It is extraordinary that, when Jamison Equity paid its deposit of about six-and-a-bit million dollars, it got the seats on the board of Australian Stevedores straightaway, yet the other seller of shares in Australian Stevedores, Howard Smith, did not allow Jamison Equity to take its seats on the board straightaway. It waited until the final payment by Jamison Equity had been made to Howard Smith before it allowed Jamison Equity to take the seats on the board. We gave away our seats on the board. We gave 100 per cent control of our shareholding to Jamison Equity merely for the payment of a deposit. It was an extraordinary commercial arrangement.

         This raises many questions, but the principal question is: why is it that this government has interfered so much over the years in the management of ANL, to the point where today this company is in very serious trouble, to the point where today the board has had to be sacked and, in effect, almost to the point of liquidators being put in to try and take over the running of the company over the last few months?

That is why we are opposing this bill, which has been put forward today by the Assistant Treasurer in the parliament. We are going to oppose it. We believe that if people really want to do something about fixing up the Australian shipping industry there are ways it can be done. There are ways you can make ANL more valuable by further reform of the Australian shipping industry. For example, company employment would add value to ANL.

But there are people around Australia today who would argue very strongly, as indeed the Shipping Industry Reform Authority has—it is an organisation which has been set up to try and help companies like ANL become more profitable—that if you implemented a package of reforms, one of which included the establishment of a second register, you could save $2 million per vessel per year in operating expenses. If you multiply that saving by the number of vessels ANL operates that fall into that category, then you can suddenly start to see that ANL can become quite a profitable company and, as such, have quite a good value as a business when put up for auction in the marketplace.

         We in the opposition have said for years that ANL should be privatised—100 per cent of ANL. I have been saying for years, as have many of my colleagues, that if you do it right there is nothing stopping you from selling ANL to an existing major transport operator—certainly I hope it would be an Australian transport operator, and there are Australian transport operators who would be interested—who could bring in-house customers straight into ANL. The biggest problem that ANL really confronts, apart from the government's interference, is that it does not have an in-house customer base, unlike BHP, our biggest shipping company in Australia, which has its own in-house customer that funnels in a guaranteed amount of custom every day.

In the process, in true Brereton style, the government has done many backflips on this issue. The sum consequence of all of that is that ANL is in a parlous state today because of the mismanagement of this government, the interference by ministers of transport over a long period.

         I make no apology for the fact that I have always supported the view that the Australian National Line should be kept in Australian hands, should be Australian crewed and Australian flagged, and should provide wages and conditions which are comparable to the rest of Australia. The purpose of this bill, as has been said, is to allow the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to guarantee certain debts of ANL Limited. ANL and its troubles have been regularly examined in most of the media outlets over recent months, and that attention has reached fever pitch over the last few weeks. In the last week, the

         The honourable member for Hume made much of the fact that the ANL is important to the ALP. Of course it is important. It is important to people like me who represent ports, it is important to Australia and it is important that it be kept within Australia ownership. Why is that? The reason is that Australia, as a maritime nation, is, like most of the maritime world, going to be faced over the next 10 to 15 years with a serious shortage of shipping. Even if they started building ships tomorrow at a rate of knots, we would still be facing a shortage of shipping. As well we will be facing a shortage of properly trained crews. It will be a worldwide phenomenon that we will be faced with a shortage of officers and crews.

         That is one of the reasons I have always strongly argued that we should keep an Australian shipping line. Granted, the Australian shipping line carries very little of Australia's actual trade—only about five per cent. Nevertheless, it is important that that small amount of trade as it is be kept within Australian hands, if for no other reasons than strategic reasons. It would be a very bad decision by any government that would see our shipping line sold off overseas, crewed by foreign crews and officered by foreign officers. We would lose the control we have.

         I am the first to agree that governments of all political persuasions have made very poor decisions when it comes to ANL. The Hawke government pledged a $100 million grant to recapitalise the ANL in 1989. That injection was to allow ANL to restructure and purchase new vessels. As a result, the ANL had to enter into some very complex financial arrangements—which even a master of business administration from Harvard would have great difficulty in understanding—including the sale of vessels to keep afloat when the government stopped the grant.

However, when the shipyard went into receivership, the $10 million that was promised as a capital injection to complete the construction of the ship never came about. Over a decade ago, ANL was on its knees but the government of the day refused to allow the write-off of its debts. Instead, the government decided to convert the debt into government equity in ANL.

Because it is Australian owned, the Australian people own it; it is our shipping line. While ever I remain standing, it will remain that way—that is my commitment, which I know is shared by many of my colleagues on this side of the House.

         The government, the Maritime Union of Australia and the ACTU have negotiated a package which I believe provides the foundations for ANL's survival. The negotiated package, which was concluded on 13 September 1994, includes that the Commonwealth will guarantee certain debts of ANL. This measure is given effect by this bill. It provides an exemption from income tax for international seafarers, the benefit of which will be passed on to the employers. This income tax measure, which as usual has been condemned by the opposition, will save employers 27 per cent on wage costs.

Those tourist operators, which the opposition seeks to claim as its own at every opportunity, will be left with nothing except polluted beaches if cabotage is lifted. It is not alarmist to say that great tourist attractions along the east coast of Australia, such as the Great Barrier Reef, would be under great threat from substandard shipping if cabotage were lifted.

The French have a second register of their ships in the Kerguelen Island in Antarctica. No-one visits the island; it is inhabited by penguins.

It shows the contradiction of the opposition. If it is so keen to have a second register, why was it so critical of the government when we gave some tax exemptions to the shipping industry? It was critical of that, yet it is in here today talking about a second register. We must always reject the idea of having a second register established in Australia.

         ANL is the standard bearer for what ships should be: safe, reliable and environmentally sound, with trained and decently treated mariners. Essentially it is a model for international shipping. ANL is too important to be opposed or to be made the issue of cheap political point scoring. There is indeed a long, hard road ahead to make ANL a financially viable shipping line. For all of the reasons I have outlined today, the guarantee of ANL is only a small part of what Australia owes to the shipping industry.

         I must say that I find it amazing that the opposition will oppose this legislation. I have to ask myself: why is it going to oppose this legislation? The only reason I can think of is that it sees within this legislation the opportunity to score a couple of cheap political points. One would have thought that, if opposition members had the interests of this country and the shipping industry at heart, they would have joined with the government on this issue to make sure that ANL is a viable shipping line.

         One is also somewhat surprised when those opposite talk about issues which would diminish shipping in Australia—issues such as a second register. It has been shown that wherever a second register has been established the only thing it guarantees in the shipping industry is substandard shipping and poorly paid and poorly trained crews. That is what a second register guarantees. That is what the opposition is proposing. What we need are Australian trained crews and Australian personed ships flying under the Australian flag to ensure that the shipping industry, especially ANL, remains a viable part of the Australian economy. I commend the legislation to the House.

         I have no doubt at all that, when the member for Throsby looked at this bill, he must have realised with some horror what was going on. The reason we are here today is to vote for or against—in our case, against—this government guarantee. It is a government guarantee which has been brought in here because of the mishandling and mismanagement of the issue. It has been mishandled by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), and there have been years of incompetence in managing this shipping company.

         For the 12 years that the government has handled and had the responsibility for this corporation it has totally failed to fund it. It has been warned time and again in the annual accounts of ANL that something must be done. So we in the opposition looked around at a number of government enterprises to see what ought to be done. We produced a booklet called
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Privatisation—the Australian way

         . It listed a number of corporations which ought not to be owned by the government, and ANL was one. That was in 1988. I am sure the member for Throsby, being a good member of the Left, would have been full of horror and scandalised by the thought we were going to sell all these corporations.

         Remember what happened with the Commonwealth Bank in 1990? The union was told by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), `No, we won't sell you.' It even gave a $300,000 donation to the ALP fighting fund. Within six months of the return of the government, what happened? It sold 25 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank and subsequently followed that up with a few more sales. That is the background of the government's approach to these things. It has misled the unions, its mates. In this particular case, the government vehemently denied that it would do nothing about it. But, in 1991, it announced to the horror of many around the place that it was going to sell a percentage of ANL.

        Formally proposed by the Government for the first time in the 1991 budget papers, little progress has been made on the introduction of private equity to date, and the constraints arising from the need to rely solely on debt continue to inhibit the growth of the business.

        That was in 1993. We then had some changes in the ministry. There was continuing uncertainty as to what was really going to occur. Were we going to sell the lot? Were we going to sell some to foreign trade? Were we going to keep it all in Australia's hands? Then came the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, the Minister for Transport. He was going to really cut a swathe through transport. Into the ANL he hops and decides that, on reflection, after he had a report prepared in this area, he probably ought to declare it an insolvent corporation, a company which has no value whatsoever.

         On the basis of this pronouncement, the minister then hops into the operation to try to get some rationalisation. To do this, one of the first things he manages to do is to fire the board and to replace it not with people from the industry itself but with an adviser, Mr Turnbull, who was advising the board prior to its dismissal. He was joined by one of the great Labor mates, Neville Wran, and a couple of other commercial people. They went on the board to try to sort out the problems.

         The board made recommendations very quickly that the corporation should not sell the stevedoring industry shares and that it ought to have time to think about what to do in terms of working out a corporate plan for the rehabilitation of the Australian National Line. The advice given by the board was totally ignored by the government. We rushed into a series of alarms on the day the board was dismissed. The secretary of the ACTU wrote to the minister on that very same day. His letter reads:

        Having received that letter and the board of ANL having just been fired, we proceeded with great haste to sell its best asset. The best asset going for it is its shareholding in Australian Stevedores. Those shares were held in a joint venture capital company through Howard Smith. Howard Smith had been made an offer for purchase in a complicated commercial deal under which both shareholdings were bought. Howard Smith accepted the offer for a shareholding in the joint company. The same offer was made for Australian National Line's holding in the joint company. No response was received by the offerer. Indeed, the offerer considered it highly likely that that meant the government would not sell and had proposed in its own way that maybe that was the best option—to keep the government in for its 25 per cent interest in this area.

         Straight out of the blue, unknown to ANL—and it was not aware of the Kelty letter—it had a telephone call from the minister direct to accept the offer. The $28 million deal was accepted and the payment for it then became the subject of some concern. As was related in an article I read, the minister was attending a funeral. The car phone went beep, beep, beep, and Malcolm Turnbull was on the other end saying, `We have to find a way to fund the share deal.' A deposit was taken of roughly 20 per cent, $28 million, and the rest was to be paid on completion.

         At the same time the directors responsible for the ANL shareholding resigned from the company, and the ownership of those shares was transferred to the buying corporation. That is a highly unusual commercial transaction. You do not give up your rights to ownership without good reason, certainly not before you have paid for it and certainly not without a lien on the securities involved. That was a very unusual operation.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The time for payment came. From the payment of the 20 per cent deposit to the final payment—which occurred towards the end of October, roughly a period of two months—an amount of some $22 million was outstanding. The Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) said in response to a question in the House here that the corporation had to draw down some bank bills to pay its way in that time because it did not have the money in from the sale of these shares. Presumably, the implication of the answer of the Minister for Finance is that no interest was paid. If I ask the member for Throsby what the interest is on $22 million at 10 per cent for two months, he will probably tell me the answer is half a million dollars. That is what the government gave up by mismanaging this whole affair.

         What is the haste? The Minister for Transport wanted this deal done before the ALP conference so he could sell the Left out. He did not have to worry about that. He went down there to make some big deals and there were all sorts of talks. The member for Banks (Mr Melham) was talking about what the numbers were and how they are going to stop this privatisation. But the minister got in under its neck, sold the Left out and did not worry about the nicer points—$400,000 or $500,000 in interest commitment. The company could go and draw down some bank bills to pay its way until it got some money in. But the minister got his way. It really was one of the poorer operations I have seen take place in the management of a government debt.

         Can I pass from there to an even bigger area of amusement. Not only did the company get control of the asset for a deposit, paying the rest later, but also, on hearing that the shares had been sold to Chris Corrigan's corporation, Kelty rang the minister and said, `I will buy the shares back from you.' But the minister decided he had too good a deal and would stay with the shares.

         That must be one of the great sagas; the member for Throsby must be wondering what went on. The government gave away half a million bucks, gave away control of the shares, and got out from underneath the whole ANL privatisation before the Labor Party conference. When Kelty caught up with the fact that the minister had dealt him out, despite the fact that he had written to him, he rang up the purchaser and said, `I'll buy the shares back from you.' That is not bad stuff. Anyone in the Labor Party who thinks that was an unusual operation would be well advised to think that that is totally correct.

         The proposition now coming forward is based on the fact that the government has now indicated that it is prepared to sell 75 per cent to the maritime unions. I am sure the member for Throsby thinks that is a wonderful idea. The trouble is that ANL is an ongoing loss maker. This bill is an open-ended bill which guarantees all the debts of ANL as an ongoing operation. So it currently has 25 per cent of the action or the equity. The trade union is proposing to have 75 per cent of the equity. Presumably, some breakdown in government ownership will go on. But while the government has a minority interest, or even a majority interest, it has 100 per cent of the debt risk in accordance with this bill. The taxpayers of Australia underwrite all the loans, all the losses, irrespective of who happens to be the owner of this corporation under this bill.

I find that degree of commercial incompetence rather stunning. I find the ability to be trodden on by the unions quite remarkable.

         Do honourable members remember the great sea strike, when they eventually caught up with the fact that the minister for transport had sold the shares, and Kelty could not buy them back? So all of a sudden we had a strike. The minister was in the snow fields—the modern day snow bunny. He was a real bunny on the waterfront, so he hopped off to the snow fields. He could not be found. He kept out of the road because he knew the reason for the strike was wholly because of his actions—his actions in deceiving the unions and his fellow members of the ALP who were going down to Hobart to talk about the ANL sale and privatisation generally.

So we have a strike, and down we come to fix the strike. The media said, `It will be all over in half an hour. The station is not switched on.' It went on and on.

         The result of that was a great backdown, a concession in the PAYE tax.

If that was applied evenly to the rest of Australia, it would have an enormous impact. But we have this little impact here, this little give-away to the mates.

         At the end of the meeting, after all the hot language and abuse that would have been used, the strike was stopped. Millions were lost to the consumers of Australia, the operators of the wharves of Australia, the housewives of Australia and the businesses of Australia. It was all stopped. Kelty had got some revenge. He was still not too happy, but he got something out of it. The trade unions had stopped the sale, and a few abusive words had turned a loss-making corporation into a very profitable one with enormous potential. ANL had gone from something we could not give away to a great asset after a couple of hours of abuse in the cabinet room. We now have a situation where the government presents a bill to guarantee the debt down the trail. The government will not own all the shares, but it will take the risk for all the debt that comes down the trail. I find the whole proposition quite preposterous.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        According to Mr Bolitho, the method used to value the ANL by Price Waterhouse/Salomon Bros "was inappropriate in relation to ANL and its circumstances, and if any of the leading companies in Australia were to be valued and treated in a similar manner, I suspect the same results could be obtained".
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Davidson further notes:
       </para>

        He quotes Mr Bolitho as saying:

        This difference in the valuation of ANL was also raised and accounted for by Bob Walker, the Professor of Accounting at the University of New South Wales, whom Kenneth Davidson also quotes in his article. He says that Professor Walker explains the difference as follows:

         Taxpayers asking "how could ANL's audited $158 million shareholders' equity turn into negative $118 million in just 10 months . . . (should realise) that there's a difference between a balance sheet prepared on a `going concern' basis and one prepared on a `forced sale' basis".

        So there are very many reasons why there have been these major differences in the valuation.

        It is absolutely vital that we maintain our shipping industry, jobs and commitment, and not cede sovereignty to other nations. This is a crucial industry for this country.

Any minor savings that may be made would be fully offset by our balance of trade in terms of shipping costs.

        As an island continent, Australia depends on shipping. ANL's objectives when it was set up nearly 40 years ago were to provide efficient coastal shipping services, dispose of inefficient vessels obtained by the government during the war and to prepare an Australian merchant fleet to meet national needs. It has since expanded its operations into the international shipping arena, containerisation, ship management, stevedoring and door to door services. Since 1989 it has operated as a wholly owned government trading enterprise. I note that the member for Ryan indicated that the opposition was gung-ho to sell it back in 1988.

Indeed, the shipping reforms that have been undertaken have been very significant to bring us to a position of relative competitiveness in what is undoubtedly a highly competitive international trade environment where we are having to compete against countries that use very poorly paid non-trained crews, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, have mentioned on numerous occasions in relation to the

         It is forecast that ANL will sustain a loss of over $11 million in the 1993-94 financial year but return to profit in 1995-96. Over the 10 years from 1983 ANL returned a net profit after tax in seven of those years totalling $23.5 million. Despite this, ANL has completed a $400 million re-equipment program with the result that its fleet age averages eight years compared to World Bank estimate of 17 years as the average age of the world fleet. In fact, I think it is true to say that the former chairman has suggested that, over that period of time, our government has ultimately put in a lot less than the amount of its commitment of something around $10 million. So I think ANL has done a remarkable job, given the constraints under which it has been operating.

There are only three operators of Australian flag ships in the international liner trade to Australia of which ANL is a major player.

         In total, Australian flag ships carry about eight per cent of Australian exports and nine per cent of Australian imports. ANL makes a vital contribution to Australia's international trade development using Australian flagged and crewed vessels. This is of maximum concern to the Maritime Union of Australia. I think we should reflect on the terms of agreement that were negotiated in September with the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the ACTU and the Maritime Union of Australia. The first thing that is said in this agreement is:

        The Government and the unions are committed to a viable Australian flagged shipping industry. The Government's intention is not to liquidate ANL but to restructure ANL as an economically viable enterprise. It is recognised that the competitiveness of ANL and other Australian international shipping operators depends on a range of factors, including taxation and industrial arrangements, and that the future of ANL is linked to government policy. Accordingly, for the Government's part, it will urgently consider exempting from income tax the salary and wage of international seafarers and other fiscal measures contained in the Taylor Report.

        So, in implementing this taxation arrangement, we were picking up on one of Ray Taylor's recommendations. The union, for its part, was prepared to consider a number of issues which included further reducing crew size and other crewing factors, passing on the PAYE tax to employers, changing existing employment arrangements, negotiation of a long-term wage agreement, reducing training costs to a level no higher than community standards and entering into an industrial peace accord. So the idea that somehow we have just capitulated to or been run over by the trade union movement is another fairytale that it pleases the opposition to continue to trot out.

        ANL plays a highly strategic role for Australia as an efficient shipping line which provides a window into decision-making processes in the shipping industry which impact on Australia.

        One of the tasks that the new board has announced is that it will be reviewing the current shipping routes on which ANL is operating to make sure that we are working in those areas where we can make a profit.

        ANL must remain an intact entity to be able to capitalise on the high growth markets that are emerging from Asia, as preferences for shipping requirements shift from mere price factors to broader concerns such as the provision of integrated door to door transport services.

It will not only maintain jobs for maritime workers but also contribute immensely and increasingly to the future economy of this country.

If home buyers were losing money because they had a debt on their houses and came to the government and said that they wanted an act passed through parliament—as the government is trying to do for ANL—the government would laugh at them. The fact that the taxpayer is expected—as has been the case for many years—to not only pick up the losses of the past but also pick up unspecified losses for the future must be of great concern to everybody.

         Let me go through the record of the government on privatisation. It is a shocking and deplorable record. The first case that I would like to deal with is Qantas and Australian Airlines. I will read to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis—you rightly know this—from the ALP policy headed `Relevant platform extract'. It states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . and acknowledging that deregulation of the domestic aviation market questions the need for a publicly-owned domestic airline to protect against the emergence of a domestic aviation monopoly, no longer requires the airlines remain in full public ownership.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is in relation to Australian Airlines. The document continues:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Any sale should include an arrangement—a) in the case of Australian Airlines, the Australian government may sell up to 100 percent equity; b) in the case of Qantas, its status as a national flag carrier means the Australian government must retain 51 percent equity and control and that this be legislatively guaranteed; c) no more than 35 percent of Qantas may be sold to foreign interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        Here are the actual ALP initiatives following its stated policy. In June 1992, the government announced its decision to sell Australian Airlines to Qantas and to sell 100 per cent of Qantas by trade sale. In March 1993, the government sold 25 per cent equity in Qantas to British Airways and effected a recapitalisation of the airline. Subsequently, the Minister for Finance announced that the remaining 75 per cent equity would be sold by public float but that this would be deferred until the benefits from the Australian Airlines-Qantas merger and British Airways link was apparent. The government is planning for the float to occur during the 1994-95 year. That statement says, `We're going to stick out and hold Qantas as a national flag carrier.' That is the government's policy: it is going to sell it.

         The government dudded the Australian public. It believed the government at the last election. Nothing the government promises the Australian people can be believed. I refer to the government's stated policy on ANL. Here is another ripper:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The heavy capital burden associated with maintaining an internationally competitive shipping line, and the fact that ANL requires enhanced commercial flexibility if it is to retain its place in world shipping, no longer require that the shipping line remain in full public ownership.
       </para>
       <para>
        The government's statement infers that it is going to flog ANL. It continues:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . any alteration in the ownership structure of ANL will be implemented by way of the expansion of the capital base of ANL Limited and will not involve any reduction in ANL's Australian staffed vessels, but rather will be directed to the expansion of ANL's share of the carriage of Australia's physical exports and imports.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the 1991-92 budget, the government announced its decision to sell a substantial part of ANL. At the time of the 1993 election, there had been no move to implement this decision. At the recent national conference in Hobart, the conference agreed to the sale of a majority stake in ANL Limited to a consortium led by the Maritime Union and funded by members' superannuation funds. The proposal also details the company retaining PAYE instalments that would have been deducted from seafarers' wages and the workers would be exempted from income tax. The cost of these concessions has been reported to be about $28 million per annum. In addition, the Commonwealth would provide for accelerated depreciation for new efficient ships run with small crews.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         On 22 September 1994, the Senate passed a resolution requesting the Auditor-General to examine the financial position of ANL before it is sold. There we have it. The government's policies cannot be believed. When the government does set out to implement a policy, it allows unions to use superannuation funds, the stored up savings of members of that union, to purchase a bodgie business. Neville Wran said that it should be liquidated. That is what the government has done. I cannot believe that a government which claims to stand for the workers of Australia could fiddle and play with the lives and the future of those workers in the way that it has with the ANL deal.

         The Federal Airports Corporation was another privatisation movement by the government. The government is completely inconsistent in all of its policy statements. It does not matter whether it is taxation, the economy or privatisation. We are looking at privatisation. Let us consider what the government said on 18 April 1994. The Minister for Transport and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has all of this stuff. I do not know how the minister comes to get into so much trouble. He just seems to get into one bit of strife after another. In regard to air safety—

         —He is incompetent. I am starting to get the picture and I believe the people of Australia are starting to get the picture too. The minister appears to be a slow learner in some of these areas. On 18 April 1994 the Minister for Transport indicated:

        He is staking out the ground. The government's Working Nation white paper of May 1994 announced that a scoping study would be undertaken into the possible sale of the corporation's airports. The government indicated a preference to sell these airports individually, subject to the outcome of that study.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The ALP's national conference resolved that the policy of maintaining airports in public ownership be maintained. So, in one instance, policy can be reversed, turned over. Nobody can believe it. In relation to the Australian Industry Development Corporation, AIDC, Labor Party policy states:
        </tab>

        Labor will seek to promote Australian established and new industries by . . . retaining the AIDC in majority public ownership, consistent with capital adequacy.

        The government has flogged it. It has gone. Labor Party policy said that AIDC was going to be kept, but it has flogged it; it has gone. The recent ALP National Conference approved the sale of the Commonwealth's remaining equity in AIDC. The Labor Party policy in relation to the National Pipeline Authority states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recognising the importance of a domestic oil and gas industry, Labor will . . . retain the National Pipeline Authority in government ownership . . .

       <para>
        The government announced in the 1992 budget that it was proceeding with the sale of the pipeline. There is no policy platform in relation to CSL, but the government commenced selling that on 2 May 1994. On the Commonwealth Bank, apart from the Labor Party's grand statement about all the things it wants to socialise, there is no mention of the Commonwealth Bank in its policy platform, and it proceeded to publicly float it anyway.

         Time and again the government has promised things but has broken its promises. The government has dudded the people of Australia. Nothing could be worse than the way the government has handled the sale of the Australian National Line. The current chairman—this man, Mr Wran, being paid a record amount of money—said that he believes that it is a bankrupt organisation. Minister Brereton claims that he knew a lot about how it was being operated. When asked on 16 September by Monica Attard and Jim Gale whether he was aware of the discrepancy in the various valuations of ANL, Minister Brereton said that he was aware of a lot of things. He also said:

        I was certainly aware that the board had consistently and persistently said that the company was travelling quite well.

        I was aware of the fact that ANL had budgeted in 1993 for a $2.4 million loss and it's coming in at $23.5 million. I was aware that it's lost between $20 million and $30 million each year over the last four years. I was aware of the fact that the net debt of the company had reached $180 million, and even if we had picked up the tap for all of that debt and eliminated its servicing responsibilities, the company would still be going backwards.

       <para>
        There we have the minister responsible admitting that ANL, the Australian National Line, was bankrupt, that it had lost $20 to $30 million a year over the last four years and that the debt of the company had reached $180 million; yet he was prepared to allow the Maritime Union of Australia to sink its members' funds into this company. The savings of its members, the superannuation funds of that union, have now been invested in a company that has lost a total of $180 million.

         That is the standard of management of the Australian Labor Party. Those are the processes it has used for the sale of ANL. It has used those processes all the way through its privatisation program. It promises one thing and does another. I draw the attention of the House to the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in regard to Minister Brereton. The Prime Minister was asked on 12 September whether Minister Brereton had been rolled in regard to ANL. He responded:

        That is the Prime Minister's regard for Minister Brereton. Every day that goes past, Laurie sinks deeper into the mire. Nothing could be better raised as an epitaph on a tombstone over Laurie Brereton than the way he has dealt with the funds of the maritime unions and ANL.

Is the Treasurer also aware that industrial action by the Transport Workers Union will restrict the capacity of farmers to move fodder for starving stock during one of the worst droughts in Australia's history? In the light of these consequences flowing from the industrial action of the Transport Workers Union, how does the government propose to bring this dispute to an end? Does the government now accept that it was a mistake to repeal secondary boycott legislation? Will the Treasurer, as the minister responsible for economic management, urge his colleagues to reintroduce secondary boycott legislation to deal effectively with actions such as these?

         If the union pursues its claim in that way, there will be no problems whatsoever. If it seeks to pursue claims in a way which involves use of industrial disputation in a way which is against the law, then obviously the law is there to be used, as the Minister for Industrial Relations said yesterday. It is not as though there are no constraints on industrial action. There are such constraints within the law, and I understand that the union has said that it will certainly pursue its claim within the law. We certainly expect it to do so.

         This government drove the national competition policy. In 1991 we put it to the states that we wanted an effective national competition policy, which would inevitably mean that we would have to get into some areas in the jurisdiction of the states to improve our level of competitiveness. It was jointly agreed that there should be an inquiry into this matter. The Hilmer report was eventually brought down in August 1993. We have attempted to pursue the cooperative implementation of that report with the states since that time. Both in Hobart at the beginning of this year at the COAG meeting and subsequently at Darwin in August the federal government pursued this matter with the states. Indeed, the whole of the COAG meeting in Darwin was devoted to this issue.

         At the Hobart meeting, we were told by the states that, although they agreed in principle with this, they were concerned about the need for compensation for the loss of monopoly rents of their government enterprises which would be open to competition for the first time. In Darwin the states added to that a concern that they share in the benefits they saw coming to the federal government from increased levels of economic activity as a result of the implementation of these reforms. They wanted their fair share of that. That was an additional request and, as an outcome of the Darwin meeting, it was agreed that we would conduct an inquiry through the Industry Commission to assess the likely benefits of the Hilmer and related reforms and the basis of getting a fair share of those benefits as between the governments.

         As a result, we expect to have a basis upon which we can move to implement the Hilmer reforms in agreement with the states, hopefully on the basis of the report being able to agree on what appropriate shares are. We are in the somewhat ludicrous position of having to argue about sharing the benefits of the reforms before the reforms have ever been implemented. It seems to be putting the cart before the horse to some extent. But that has been the demand of the Liberal states, so that is the course we have been forced to go down.

         We are also pursuing the national competition legislation. A draft of that legislation has been available for some time. The government has had all sorts of responses from various interested bodies. We will finally put that legislation to the parliament next year and that legislation will then be passed in time for us to get implementation by the middle of 1995. So we do see the Hilmer report recommendations as being capable of being put in place by the middle of next year. So long as we do not get Liberal state governments continuing to block these reforms and preventing Australia from developing a more competitive economy, then we will be in a very good position to have these sweeping reforms, which will certainly produce considerable benefits for the Australian economy, well on the way to implementation from the middle of next year.

         We certainly refute that argument. We also believe that, if you are going to do this kind of analysis properly, then you need to include in the analysis all of the relevant data, which includes all of the redistributive elements. This means you have to take into account not just gross incomes but also taxes, as they are part of the redistribution process, and non-cash benefits, which often do not get taken into account in these analyses. Things like Medicare and child care are very important redistributive elements. I am sure a full analysis would support what we have been saying. Ann Harding, whose work has been used a lot in this respect, has certainly agreed that there has been a strong improvement in the position of people at the bottom of the ladder—

         Next week I will be visiting regions in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. On this occasion, I will be doing so with Mr Lindsay Fox and Mr Bill Kelty, who have been strong proponents of regional development. I believe that we will be able to get a much stronger commitment from those regions to work with us. Essentially, what we will be about is showing how Working Nation can work for their regions. I am sure that they will respond because, in all of the discussions that I have had with the regions, they see this as a government committed to ensuring that their region grows. They see within Working Nation a commitment to resources, support and partnership. What I urge them to do, like all regions across the country, is to get involved in the partnership.

         —My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. In light of the minister's response to the last question from his own side, I draw his attention to the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics survey which found that an estimated 24 per cent of all families had no family member employed; that there were 102,700 two-parent families with dependants where the husband was unemployed and the wife was either unemployed or not in the labour force; that there are 1,152,300 people in families where no member of the family is employed; and that there are 808,700 dependants in families where no parent is employed. Is it not a fact that the government's higher interest rate policies will mean that more Australians will live in families without a breadwinner? Does not your support for the government's current economic policies inevitably mean a sacrifice of future jobs growth and a widening gap between rich and poor in this country?

The shadow spokesman's question assumes two things.

         —Because the 9.9 per cent—I know the Leader of the National Party has referred to this—includes many people not on unemployment benefit. The other assumption that is made in the question is that all families must have both parents in the work force. It is true that we have made conscious decisions to encourage many more women into the work force. That is demonstrated through the participation rate. But we say it should be a choice for the family as to whether both parents are in the work force or one of them. That is why we have introduced notions such as the parenting allowance.

         It is interesting to go to the statistics. A breakdown of the statistics shows that the total number of couples with children is 1,960,000. The number of couples where neither person is employed is 194,000—that is the 9.9 per cent. But the breakdown of that shows that where both parents are unemployed—that is, looking for work and cannot get it—and therefore on unemployment benefit, the proportion is 1.3 per cent. The rest of the 9.9 per cent is made up of one unemployed and one not in the work force or both not in the labour force. In other words, they could be people on disability pensions. They could be pensioners—people who by virtue of their age are out of the work force. I would suggest to people on the opposite side of the House that they make a proper analysis of the figures.

         The final point I would make to the honourable member for Goldstein is this: what we can see from the calculation on page 6 of the publication, table 1, is that couples with dependants had a lower unemployment rate than the aggregate for the economy. If you go to the figures in that table, you will see that couples with dependants registered 7.3 per cent unemployment versus 9.6 per cent for the rest of the nation.

         I am not saying 7.3 per cent is a great figure; it is not. Neither is 9.6 per cent; neither is 800,000 still out of work. But the fact of the matter is that this government has created 404,000 jobs since it was re-elected to government. Going into the election, we said we would create 500,000 jobs, which was ridiculed by the other side. The fact of the matter is that we have reached 80 per cent of the target in a little over half the time.

         The other thing we have done is to ensure that the long-term unemployed are not left behind. As a government over the past 11 years, as has been indicated by the Treasurer today and the Minister for Social Security previously, we have ensured targeted assistance through transfer payments to help families, particularly those on low incomes and particularly those experiencing difficulties in getting jobs. That is a commitment that we will continue, but it is a commitment that is already bearing significant fruit. I must say that commitment would have been wiped out had those on the other side of the House been elected at the last election. Thank goodness for those families they were not.

         The reforms that have taken place in Australia Post have meant that the performance of Australia Post has improved dramatically. Its revenue is up six per cent this year to $2 1/2 billion. It has made a capital repayment to the Commonwealth of $200 million and the dividend this year was a record $90 million. Labour productivity is at an all-time record high, due mainly to the fact that the management of Australia Post, the unions and the work force are working together to improve its productivity and provide a better service to customers. These benefits are not just restricted to the organisation or the shareholder; they are also being delivered to the people who use the postal service. Australia Post has frozen the 45c standard letter rate until 1997—a total freeze period of five years.

         With the passage of the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill through the House yesterday, Australia Post will be facing increased competition. The minimum rate which can be charged by a competitor for Australia Post will drop from 10 times the standard letter rate to four times the standard letter rate. This will expose Australia Post to more competition. At the moment about 40 per cent of Australia Post's revenue is open to competition, and as a result of the bill passed by the House that will increase to 55 per cent.

         The second part of the honourable member's question concerned what other proposals are around for dealing with the postal service. I did go looking through The Things That Matter to see if I could find what the opposition's view was on Australia Post. I wondered whether opposition members followed the British Conservative Party's line of privatising the postal service. You have to look pretty hard because you will not find any mention at all of postal services in The Things That Matter. You then have to turn to speeches given by the shadow minister for communications and the arts, Senator Alston. What was his view on the government's reform measures? In a speech he made in the Senate in August about dropping the rate from 10 times to four times the letter rate he said:

Is the minister aware that the 1991 census figures show that in my electorate of Gwydir more than 25 per cent of families have annual incomes below $16,000 while here in Canberra just 6.7 per cent of families fall into this category? Is the minister further aware that the 10 most disadvantaged electorates as measured in these terms are in rural and regional Australia while the 10 most affluent are in metropolitan Australia? Does the minister agree that these figures, obtained prior to the devastating drought, highlight an alarming income gap between the urban rich and the rural poor?

         —I am not in a position to refute the figures given by the honourable member. It may well be the case that what he says is the truth, but I am not quite sure what he then deduces from that. We all know that people in the rural areas have from time to time done things very hard and obviously that is the case at present. They are essentially price takers and, therefore, they are in the position, in terms of most of the goods they produce for this country, where the prices cannot be set by them; they have to be set by world markets. In those circumstances, they have to take what the world markets dictate.

         It is obviously important in those circumstances that they have low costs and that they have maintenance of low inflation. It is a major policy ambition of the government, having achieved quite low inflation by historic standards, to maintain low inflation. That is something which I would have thought the rural sector would be very much in support of. Clearly, maintenance of low inflation will be of major benefit to people in the electorate of the honourable member and in other rural electorates.

         Low inflation has various other things going for it, but for people in rural electorates it is a most important policy development. We now have inflation of around two per cent. We had inflation in the period of the Fraser government of, on average, 10.7 per cent. So, quite clearly, in terms of relative inflation rates, we are doing infinitely better now than at the time of the previous coalition government when it was supposed to be producing policies which were conducive to the interests of rural people.

         It is important for us to keep low costs. It is also important that we assist people in rural areas when they are in difficulty. That, clearly, has been done with the drought where there is a very substantial package available to people there. The government will continue to provide assistance.

         In relation to interest rates, it is also the case that those who are in the most drought affected areas and in extreme difficulty are 100 per cent protected by the package that was announced by the government from any interest rate increases. They are, therefore, fully protected—100 per cent protected—from interest rate increases that occur. That was an important part of the package of assistance that the government produced to assist people in rural areas.

         —I thank the honourable member for Lowe for her question. It is gratifying to note that women are sharing in the employment growth which has been brought about by the policies of this government. There are now more than 3.4 million women in jobs, well above the peak levels of 1990 and 122,000 more than there were 12 months ago. That is a growth of four per cent over the year. The figures show that women are gaining an increasing share of both part-time and full-time work.

         The reasons for the increasing proportion of women in the work force are various. They include the growth of job opportunities in the service sector, greater employment of part-time workers or workers with flexible hours in those industries, improved access to child care and active labour market programs, which have replaced welfare benefits, with incentives to work. Underpinning these is the range of opportunities being offered to Australians to increase their skills and meet the challenge of work in an increasingly competitive world economy.

         Australian women—young women and women seeking to re-enter the work force—have taken the opportunities that have been made available. For example, a significantly higher proportion of young women, 81 per cent, stay at school to finish year 12 than do young men. The percentage of undergraduate places at university filled by women has, since 1977, exceeded the percentage taken by men. One reason that girls stayed at school longer than boys in years past was that more boys left to pursue training through apprenticeships. But, as technology in the workplace changes at an increasing pace, formal training is seen as more desirable and more women are pursuing vocational training through the TAFE system. For example, last year about 57 per cent of TAFE students were women.

         Women tend to choose training in areas which allow maximum career flexibility, such as service areas. Their qualifications, consequently, mean that they can leave and re-enter the work force or take up part-time work. Employers in these areas are often looking for someone other than the nine to five worker. Flexibility is a key word. If the flexible and qualified people are women, then women are going to be filling those jobs.

         The development of workplace training has also been enthusiastically accepted by women. In 1993-94, 64 per cent of the trainees undertaking their training in the workplace were women. The emphasis in the Working Nation statement on this type of entry level training appears likely to attract more women into vocational training devised by and suited to the needs of particular industries.

         Since 1983 we have witnessed the rise of the opportunity society. Women have responded enthusiastically to the opportunities which have been made available by this government. As a result, women have not been left behind in the strong job growth which the economy is now experiencing; indeed, they are filling the greater proportion of new jobs. This government's policy of creating more places in education and new training opportunities is clearly having a major and positive impact on the capacity of women to fill the new jobs that are emerging in this strong economy.

We have strong growth in the overall economy and we are doing it with low inflation. What else are we supposed to do?

         As I have said previously, that will not be done simply by keeping policy appropriate to what it was in the context of recession or very slow growth. In that context, we have had to adjust both fiscal and monetary policy, and it is appropriate that we do so. The adjustments that have been made to monetary policy have been modest. They certainly give us a level of mortgage interest rates which are well below the average of the 1980s, which was 13.25 per cent. The mortgage interest rates are now between nine and 9.75 per cent, which is far below the average of the 1980s. Housing remains highly affordable.

It showed that there was a clear correlation between the increase in long-term bond rates that had occurred from the time when the US increased its official rates at the end of January this year and the historical inflation record over the previous 10 years.

         Australia was not on that graph, but we would fit in with that correlation. What flows from that is that, if there is any rationality in what is happening in the bond markets, it is that they are looking back to historical inflation performances and saying, `That's the sort of thing that's likely to happen again in the future.' I strongly refute that. It is certainly something which the government is determined not to do. Having got inflation down to levels of about two per cent, we have quite clearly said that we are going to adhere to a policy that keeps underlying inflation in that range of two to three per cent. That is also the Reserve Bank  objective. The markets will accept that only by the outcomes that are produced.

         In looking at what has happened in countries generally—not just Australia—there is a belief that the past gives a clear likelihood of the future. I think that is wrong of many countries, and I certainly think it is wrong of Australia. Our policy is to maintain low inflation. We will certainly continue to pursue policy to bring that about. We will not go back to the higher inflation performance that we had in the 1980s. It was even worse for much of the 1970s. As I have said, in the period of the Fraser government the average rate of inflation was 10.7 per cent. That was what we picked up when we came into office—double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. That is what this government inherited. We have now got inflation down to levels of two per cent. We will not go back to those higher levels of the 1980s. The markets should understand that and start to set bond rates in that context.

         —I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and for his interest in this issue. As he said, it is quite right that spouses of ADF members do have particular problems in gaining employment. The best and most recent statistical comparison that we can find on this is that the general rate of unemployment for those people is at about 10.25 per cent compared with an unemployment rate for females of about 8.8 per cent.

         In addition, some honourable members would be aware of the ADF's family mobility and dislocation study that was released earlier this year. It highlighted the problems of ADF spouses in trying to get employment amidst frequent moves, mobile lifestyle, the geographical location of postings, the length of postings and the basis and the type of employment that they seek in reference to their previous careers. All this means that ADF spouses are, as the honourable member says, most disadvantaged in not only getting but also maintaining paid employment. They also face restrictions in terms of career job opportunities and some of the niceties that many of us take for granted, such as superannuation and the social benefits that accrue with regular work.

         Having recognised this, on 2 November on behalf of the government I was pleased to launch an ADF spouse employment trial in the neighbouring electorate of the honourable member, the electorate of Herbert, as part of the ADF's International Year of the Family program. This will seek to do a number of things. It will provide information to spouses on employment services that are available in the community to which they are moving; provide local job market information to them prior to posting; raise the awareness of employers of the benefits of employing ADF spouses; enhance the job readiness of service spouses through access to workshops and information sessions on topics such as job search techniques and writing CVs before they go to these posting centres; and also develop a register of service spouses in particular localities.

         The idea is that this will be run by an employment facilitator—in this case, in Townsville, from the CES—who will work with local commanders of the ADF and the spouses themselves to identify needs. Once the Townsville trial is completed, we will examine the options of trying to extend such assistance nationally. However, I do say that this is a very difficult task and I do not expect instant results overnight. No-one can ever be guaranteed employment, but we do believe that this is a first step, a practical step—somewhat overdue—in attempting to address the problems of ADF spouses and their families.

On the projections and the forward estimates, it will be less than one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. I notice that even Access Economics is now accepting that, this year, the budget deficit will actually be less than we actually projected it would be. It is saying that it will be some $400 million to $500 million less than the budget deficit figure that we announced. Obviously it will have different views in the out years, but this year it is accepting that we might even do better than we forecast. I think that Access Economics might be too pessimistic about that; we might even do better than that.

         We will not have a budget produced by the process of ruling out any particular item. We will, however, bear in mind the concern of the opposition to see the deficit tightened. We expect that, if we were to do anything of that kind, the opposition would obviously support it wholeheartedly, because it is so concerned to see the deficit reduced. If we were to take some action, such as to increase fuel taxes or anything like that, we would expect the opposition—concerned as it is about the national good and the need to reduce the budget deficit—to be wholeheartedly, 100 per cent, in support of it and not to do its normal thing of saying, `We support budget deficit reductions, but we oppose all the individual items that might go into making up such action.'

         As the Minister for Finance said here yesterday, you are deficit Daleks in this House and you are deficit junkies in the Senate, because you keep opposing all of our measures to reduce the deficit. Even quite minor items are opposed on a routine basis by the opposition in the Senate to reduce our capacity to reduce the deficit. So I find it quite ironic that we have this continuous barrage of questioning about the need to reduce the deficit and even to reduce it by way of reducing expenditures and then, when particular measures come up and go into the Senate, they are opposed by the opposition. It simply cannot pursue a consistent policy approach. The policy that it pursues at a micro level is almost 100 per cent different from that which it pursues at the macro level in saying what should be happening to deficits overall.

         The courts have recognised the tougher approach in a series of decisions and awarded record penalties—in some cases as much as $6 1/2 million in penalties and costs against TNT and Ansett Transport Industries for operating a price fixing and market sharing cartel. They have also been successful in prosecutions for price fixing and market sharing in the Brisbane concrete market. Just last week two companies and their representatives were fined over half a million dollars for price fixing and a collective boycott in the scrap metal market.

         The Federal Court recently endorsed a settlement between the Trade Practices Commission and a firm reselling mobile phones. The company had failed to reveal the true price of its phones and had breached the third-line forcing provisions by insisting that phone buyers sign up to a specific phone company. The settlement between the Trade Practices Commission and the company requires the company to give consumers the full story. Companies must write to all customers telling them that they are not bound to one phone company. They have to develop a compliance program for the industry to ensure that consumers' rights are properly protected into the future.

         There will be more of this consumer protection program when we bring in national competition policy and establish the Australian competition commission. In the meantime, the Trade Practices Commission will continue to enforce the law vigorously in the interests of consumers. When it is incorporated in the Australian competition commission next year, consumers will have further protection by the extension of the act to the activities of all businesses, including state government firms and professions. Firms now know that they have to compete on price and quality. Relying on market power and rigging markets is very much a thing of the past.

       That is an incomplete sentence. The journalist was quoting from a media release that I made on the weekend. The journalist, Tim Stevens, went on accurately to state:

       The three missing words from the first paragraph put a slightly different slant on it. The missing words were `or a republic'. The paragraph should have read, `The National Party will not be stampeded by the federal government toward either racial vilification legislation or a republic.'

The honourable member for Bennelong has raised a set of statistics about what was alleged to be the performance of a government, albeit one of which he was a member, and has contrasted it with a set of statistics presented by the Treasurer. That is for debate, obviously, but it is not a matter to be raised in a personal explanation about where he has been misrepresented, which involves a much narrower and more defined set of standing orders.

It is clear from the answers received that a huge gap is opening up between the fantasy land in which the government lives and the realities of this country. There is no doubt why this is occurring: the government is led by a Prime Minister who is dramatically out of touch with the lives of ordinary people in Australia. I do not believe there has ever been a government which has been so out of touch with what is happening in this country.

Let us just hear them again: real wages for the bottom 10 per cent of income earners have fallen by five per cent since this government came to power while incomes for the top 10 per cent have gone up by seven per cent over the same period; the top 10 per cent of Australians now get 26 1/2 per cent of household income while the bottom 10 per cent get 1 1/2 per cent; 78 per cent of those in poverty are families and 64 per cent are families with children.

         Let there be no doubt that the most damaging failure of this government has been its inability to provide enough work for people who are desperately looking for opportunities. There is a huge unmet demand for work in this country. It is a tragic fact that, despite four years of the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression of the 1930s, more people are unemployed in Australia today than there were at the peak of the last recession in 1983. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) never tires of telling us about the white paper, but the number of long-term unemployed people in Australia today is higher than it was at the peak of the last recession. This is despite all the government's efforts to hide these long-term unemployed in its short-term training and subsidised jobs programs.

         But, in addition to the people who are unemployed, there are 147,000 discouraged job seekers who are not included in the statistics; there are 700,000 other people who would be available to start work within four weeks if there were work for them; and there are 559,000 people who have some work but want more, who are underemployed or who cannot get the work they want. What does that add up to? It adds up to over two million Australians in Australia today who cannot get the work they want because of the economic policies—the totally misguided economic policies—which this government has put in place.

It may interest you, Minister, to know that 26 per cent of women say the reason they are not actively seeking work is that they cannot get child care. After 11 years of your government, child care is a hopeless mess. Your tax system discriminates against families at those very moments in the life cycle when families need that recognition which is most important to the future health and growth of their children—that is, when their children are young. When children are under five, the great majority of families in this country have one parent at home caring for their children. Yet these are the very people who are disadvantaged by your government's home child-care allowance which, as you know, is half the level of the cash rebate for working parents.

Had it not been for the activities of the coalition in the Senate forcing you to face up to the defects in your legislation on this, no action would have been taken. If the coalition had not stood up for these families, they would still be left out of any help from this home child-care allowance.

Family breakdown costs this country $3 billion a year. Over 45,000 children go through the pain of family breakdown each year, and suicide amongst Australia's young people is now the highest in the world. The International Year of the Family has not brought relief to Australia's families. It has not meant a change in the government's thinking about how to deal with this mounting social crisis in this country. It has not brought any practical solutions; it has brought a torrent of words, empty rhetoric and ill-thought-out measures in a desperate effort, as the election approaches inexorably, to persuade the people of this country that something is actually being done.

The vast number of jobs which this government brags about are part-time jobs and casual jobs.

         Of course, this growth is under the mismanagement of this government. At the same time, we have seen extraordinarily strong employment growth. There is no doubt, as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) said today, that unemployment remains too high and that the bringing down of unemployment has to remain the central priority of this government. Since the government was re-elected in 1993, and since the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that the government would not be leaving the unemployed behind, we have seen employment growth of around 400,000. Contrary to the claim made by the member for Goldstein, the bulk of that growth was full-time employment.

         Just before I came down here I had a calculation done on that, and between July last year and September this year part-time work accounted for 32 per cent.

We now have eight million people in work in this country, which is the highest number on record.

         We are also seeing significant and important inroads into the number of long-term unemployed—that is, people whose duration of unemployment is longer than a year. That number is down 87,000 since February. During the recovery from the 1982-83 recession we saw a number of years of very strong employment growth, but the negative side was that it was not until towards the end of the 1980s that we started to see major inroads into the number of long-term unemployed.

In that previous recession, around seven per cent of the jobs were going to long-term unemployed people and now the figure is around 22 per cent. That is no accident; it is the consequence of deliberate application of labour market programs targeted at those most disadvantaged in the labour market and designed to ensure that we do not have a group of people who are left behind and trapped in a situation of intergenerational unemployment, long-term unemployment or permanent exclusion from the labour market.

We have done all this with the objective of ensuring that the benefits of employment and economic growth were equitably distributed and that the long-term unemployed and the disadvantaged in the labour market would not be left behind.

         Today's matter of public importance refers to the government's management of the economy. Yes, we have had a severe recession—as have most of the countries in the developed world—which has produced a wide range of adverse effects. We have seen put in place a range of policies designed to maximise the speed of recovery from that recession and to ensure that the benefits of recovery are distributed as widely as possible. The objective statistical evidence is that those policies are having a major beneficial effect.

         What would the opposition have done? The key point in all these debates is not to look at the situation we have but to really ask questions about what the impact of different policies would be. At the last election the opposition proposed a goods and services tax which, according to Access Economics, which the honourable member for Goldstein quoted today, would have had a depressive effect on the economy and would have ensured that output and employment would have been lower than they would otherwise have been. The very Access Economics those opposite choose to quote when it suits them reached the conclusion that their policies would have darkened significantly the prospects of the unemployed. That is the whole issue of employment.

We have seen the impact of technology, which means that the disparity between the market value of the work of people with skills and education and that of people without skills has increased.

         yesterday or the day before. He made it very clear that, while increased disparity of market incomes has occurred, as it has in just about all other developed countries, changes in government policy, both in terms of the social security transfer payment system directed to those particularly on low incomes and the impact of changes in the tax system, have clearly acted to reduce that underlying trend towards greater inequalities in market incomes. That is very clearly shown in the table accompanying that article by Ross Gittins.

When his party was in office, there were—from memory—46,000 Commonwealth-funded child care places available. There are now 240,000 Commonwealth-funded child care places. So there were 46,000 available under the opposition when it was in office and there are 240,000 available now, and the opposition has the hide to come in here and complain about the inadequacies in child-care provisions.

         Peter Whiteford is a senior research fellow at the University of York who has just published a comparison between this country and the United Kingdom in terms of trends in inequality over the course of the 1980s. This is particularly important because the policies of the United Kingdom government in many ways mirror those advocated by the opposition, particularly in the areas of wholesale deregulation of the labour market. He has tried to do the sort of comprehensive analysis that we need if we want meaningful information in this sphere. It is not good enough to just concentrate on money incomes.

        In terms of the criticisms of the Australian Government policy in the 1980s, the conclusion of this article is that rather than substantial increases in poverty, falls in living standards, and increases in inequality, living standards were higher and inequality slightly lower in 1990 than when Labor took office. If poverty is measured by reference to a constant real poverty line, then poverty had fallen substantially.

        That is the record of this government. I will now say a few things about assistance to families. The opposition again accuses us of discriminating against single-earner families. It also accuses us of a sleight of hand with the introduction of the home child-care allowance. It is interesting that when legislation goes into the Senate, the opposition, which is constantly saying that we have to tighten up on fiscal policy and contain the cost of things, time and again imposes amendments that force the cost of it up. The opposition says that we have to make sure that we provide recognition of the child-care responsibilities of people whose youngest child is 24. This is the sort of absurdity that the opposition goes on with.

         The fact is that the home child-care allowance directs the assistance directly to the carer. It is not a sleight of hand; it costs $230 million more than the old with-child dependent spouse rebate, which it replaces. It is a clear and unambiguous improvement which produces major gains for some families, particularly those with a carer who,  throughout the course of a financial year, enters and exits the work force. Some of those people are up to $800 a year better off as a result of the home child-care allowance in comparison with the with-child dependent spouse rebate.

         As I indicated in question time the other day, the increase in assistance, such as the additional family payment, which has increased by 100 per cent in the case of children in the 13- to 15-year age group under this government, has been massive. The great bulk of that assistance—around about 80 per cent because it is targeted at lower income families—goes to families with a single earner. Most families with two earners have incomes which are too high to get the full benefit of AFP. So it is highly targeted and very much focused on low income families. As a result, most of that goes to single income families, and most of that goes to families where the youngest child is between the ages of zero and five. Since the government has been in office, the improvements in rent assistance, pensions and family assistance have been dramatic.

         I remind honourable members of the facts. In June 1994, an estimated 24 per cent of all families had no family members employed. There were 102,700 couple families with dependants where the husband was unemployed and the wife was either unemployed or not in the labour force. In 53 per cent of these families the husband had been unemployed for 52 weeks or more. Neither parent was employed in 10 per cent of couple families with dependants. There were 1,152,300 dependants in families where no member of the family was employed and there were 808,700 dependants in families where the parent or parents were not employed.

         Still more depressing is that there were even fewer full-time jobs in October 1994 than in January 1991; a typical award wage buys 12 per cent less than it did in 1985; and World Bank figures suggest that Australia has one of the most unequal distributions of income in the Western world—I think only Great Britain is worse. Ann Harding, whom both sides quote, said that the top 10 per cent of Australians now get 26.5 per cent of household income while the bottom 10 per cent get just 1.5 per cent. If you want to go on from that, the top 20 per cent get 42.1 per cent and the bottom 20 per cent only 5.4 per cent.

         Just think of those facts and what that has meant for families in this country. It is getting worse. As the honourable member for Goldstein and others have pointed out, it is getting worse. Look at the government's own definitions—they are very generous—of who is employed in this country. One acknowledges that the higher the number employed or the lower the unemployment level there is a reduction in extreme poverty, but there is not necessarily a reduction in the gap between the rich and the poor, depending upon income distribution. Even taking the government's own glowing descriptions of how the economy is going, real employment cannot increase much more.

         For example, even for October—the figures came in just a week ago—on a seasonally adjusted basis, actual employment in this country fell, particularly for full-time employment. In spite of our supposedly leading the OECD countries, as the minister said at question time, our unemployment level is far higher than that of the United States, Japan or New Zealand, with all that means for those families that are facing this terrible spectre of unemployment and lower real incomes. Each time there is a boom-bust cycle with this government, the percentage of people unemployed gets higher and the percentage of the long-term unemployed—that is, those unemployed for more than 52 weeks—gets greater, with all of that impact on families.

         Thirty per cent of the eight million people in employment in this country are now part-time workers. I acknowledge that some of them want to work part time, but the majority want full-time work because it means real money and real income. That is one reason why we have a terrible income distribution gap in this country. As the honourable member for Goldstein said, that employment figure includes thousands of people on trainee wages, which would reduce the unemployment figure. I have heard those training schemes defined as the government trying to make a high level of unemployment more palatable to the electorate at election time.

But, even if we get some real increase in real employment in this country, as we are seeing at present, it is not improving that income gap.

Part of that is due to the government's own policies of a rigid labour market and no incentives for productive investment to create real jobs in this country.

         The reality of this debate as we find it today is that economists are estimating that this economy will enjoy the strongest growth not only in this financial year but also in the financial year to come. That is the real situation in which we now find ourselves. But it is not only in a strong growth context; it is also in a low inflation context. We have a low inflation rate, which this government is committed to maintaining. It has seen a very different economic mix to the one which we may have had in the past. It is one which has given us a strong and rising employment base, a falling level of unemployment and a strong level of investment in the context of having one of the lowest levels of taxation in the OECD.

In that same time, unemployment has fallen since September 1993 to just over 800,000 in October 1994, which is the lowest level since May 1991. If we are going to examine this issue of income distribution and the proposition that there are growing inequalities in the way that income is distributed in this country, we have to do so in a much more serious context.

         While it is certainly true that on a base level of simply looking at income distribution there has been an increase in the level of inequality, we have to look behind that and find out just what the underlying factors and reasons are for those changes in the last 10 years. We also have to look at the way in which that has impacted on individual Australian families and at the way in which the make-up of Australian families has changed over that period.

         Finally, when we analyse those figures in the complex way in which this article does—and I will not attempt to repeat them in the few minutes available to me in this House—we find that the adjusted equivalent disposable income has changed far less than the base figures would have us accept. It has done so for some very important reasons which are underlying the changes in employment which have occurred across the OECD and the Western world in the last 10 years. We have seen the impact of technology reward increased skill levels. We have seen the formation of knowledge based industries. We have seen a dramatic increase in service industries in OECD economies. Those changes have led to greater and greater rewards—disproportionate rewards in the case of this analysis—for those with higher levels of skill.

         I would have thought that all honourable members would agree that the level of skill should be rewarded in the marketplace. That is an appropriate thing to occur. But it has left some elements of the work force behind in the way in which that income has been distributed. That change has been brought about by changes in the market forces. This government acknowledges the need to accept the discipline of the marketplace. As we speak in the House today, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is in Indonesia at the APEC meeting of leaders, ensuring as he has in recent years that we become more a part of a global economy.

         It is this government which has presided over the deregulation of many overregulated parts of the Australian economy. It is this government which has taken us into the world, particularly the Asian economic zone. It is this government which will lead that charge in South-East Asia and in the APEC region as a whole to ensure that free trade is the order of the day in the century to come. That will continue the process of opening up Australia's economy. In that process, we have to accept that there will be consequences of that market imposing its discipline on the Australian work force, as it has done to shift the emphasis in favour of those knowledge and skill based industries and those workers who are part of that knowledge and skill base.

         It is this government which has recognised that problem. It is this government which has said, `If those are the fundamental changes which are occurring in the economy, then we must respond to them and recognise the importance of them and their impact on Australian families.' That is the reality of this debate. We have accepted the discipline of market forces in the world economy. We have seen that change Australian society. This government has responded to those changes in a very practical, immediate and meaningful way for the benefit of Australian families. That is a very important distinction between the actions of this government and those of the opposition. We have recognised those changes and we have responded to them in some very positive ways.

         I would like to canvass some of those ways. The reality is that the Working Nation statement is a $10 billion commitment to human resources in this country which will ensure that we see a very significant trend towards improving the knowledge and skill base of Australian workers and which will ensure that training becomes part of the fundamental culture of this country and the economy and that business accepts its liability to train and improve the knowledge base of its work force. Those are very important responses to the underlying changes we have seen in the OECD and Western countries.

Its lack of support for Working Nation is very evident in this place and throughout the country. That is a fundamental condemnation of its attitude in this place. The opposition fails to recognise the importance of those underlying structural changes and the need for government to respond to them. It is one thing to accept the discipline of the market, but it is another thing to overlay that with important social programs and policies, like the social wage which the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) dismisses so lightly, like Medicare which honourable members opposite would have torn apart over the last few decades if they had been given that opportunity and like the improvements in education, superannuation, child care, student allowances and all those very fundamental changes which this government has presided over in response to the underlying changes in our markets.

         We cannot ignore those changes. That would be fatal. That would be the worst aspect of National Party agrarian socialism which we saw in the 1940s and 1950s and which left the economy of Australia in such a parlous state in order to address these changes in the 1970s. We have moved beyond that. We have accepted the need for the market to determine in many ways the direction of our economy in a world context and in an  Asia-Pacific context. We have devised and implemented the very massive at times social changes to our legislative and training infrastructure which are necessary to address that problem.

         While the Gittins article is very important, as the Minister for Social Security indicated, it does not address all of the issues in this area. The changes to the social wage, which includes Medicare, a very important part of our health care process, are not included. If we look at the impact on families after taking into account the social wage changes such as health, rental subsidies for low income families, family allowance and child-care payments, the provision of child care, the broadening of the base of superannuation, the importance of allowances in education and student training, and the investment which we have made in tertiary education, we see that those are the very important changes which this government has made in response to that underlying change in the economy.

          When inspecting the current facilities the committee was impressed by the dedication of the staff at Yeronga and Kelvin Grove. These personnel are presently working in old timber, metal and asbestos-clad buildings which provide inadequate working conditions and lead to operational inefficiencies. A need therefore exists to replace these substandard facilities with a modern hospital capable of providing medical and dental services for personnel of the Australian defence forces. This will be achieved by building a modern purpose-built hospital at Enoggera.

          The Defence Housing Authority proposes to provide suitable accommodation for some of these families by acquiring between 50 and 65 housing lots in a new stage of a residential subdivision—precinct 29 at Bligh Park, New South Wales. The Bligh Park estate will eventually comprise about 2,225 dwellings. The Defence Housing Authority currently has 92 properties on the estate for service families. The Defence Housing Authority intends to acquire these additional residential allotments and construct houses on them in a planned extension to the estate.

I support the Joint Committee of Public Works in approving the housing at Bligh Park, which is an extensive housing estate in the south Windsor area. I would like, however, to make a comment about the substandard housing at Hobartville, which the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) mentioned. It is older housing, which is of the style of the former state department of housing type.

          The Defence Housing Authority had planned to spend some money on minor repairs, painting, landscaping and so on and then to sell these properties. However, the local government authority, the Hawkesbury City Council, in conjunction with a local developer and, I understand, a bank, is keen to redevelop this area because of its close proximity to the township of Richmond. This would be in line with the government's better cities program and also with the urban design task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

           Currently negotiations are under way between the parties concerned. I put on record my gratitude to the Defence Housing Authority for its patience and forbearance in that time. It is proposed that the houses should be demolished and that more medium density housing of a good design be erected, with narrower carriageways and appropriate landscaping. The Defence Housing Authority has said that it would be willing, subject to approval of the design and approval of the defence personnel in the area, to take approximately 30 per cent of these houses in the new development.

I hope that this proposal can take place and I thank the Defence Housing Authority for its cooperation to date.

          In considering the program of business for Monday, 5 December, the Selection Committee was presented with requests from three delegations and four standing committees to present their reports. This is indicative of a log jam in getting these reports down before the end of the year—5 December being the last sitting Monday of the year. The time sought for presenting these reports varied between 10 minutes in three cases and the full 45 minutes for two committees. Whilst some of these requests may have been of the nature of an ambit claim, the Selection Committee considered that the problem it was presented with was rather serious.

          As a compromise, the committee allowed each of the delegation committees to table its report and allowed five minutes for a tabling statement. It assumes that, at the end of that five minutes, the committees will ask that a motion be moved `that the House take note of the paper'.

          As I said, this is perhaps just an indication that, as we get towards the end of the year, we have some difficulty in allocating the time. Also it is an indication that the 45 minutes set down for delegation and committee reports does not give the Selection Committee much flexibility. I believe that, the way the Main Committee has been working, with the assistance of the Chief Government Whip and his colleagues on the other side of the chamber, perhaps some time might be found that will allow further discussion of the reports being submitted by the parliamentary delegations and committees.

          —by leave—Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence I might say a couple of words on what the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) has just said. The government would be quite happy to pick up that proposal and maybe run the Main Committee for a few extra hours in the week that we come back—maybe even on the Tuesday, if that suits the arrangements that the clerks can organise for us. There is a fair amount of legislation that we want to send to the Main Committee in a few moments. One of the things we want to ensure is that we do not have too many late night sittings like that which we are having tonight. We hope this might be the only one we have in the next few weeks. We also want to ensure that we do not end up having to sit much later or have a guillotine.

Committee members raised with me the idea of having only the chairman and deputy chairman speak to the report here; then we might refer the report to the Main Committee so there can be some discussion on it. I think that will be timely. A lot of work has been done on that report by members of the committee. I am looking to find a way to facilitate that discussion as well.

         This report was presented to the Senate on 10 November by Senator Nick Sherry, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I would like to congratulate him on his leadership of what I believe was a very successful delegation. I will not name delegation members because they are listed in the report which I am sure most honourable members will read with interest. It is enough to say that all delegates and their partners formed a close-knit and united Australian group. However, special mention should be made of the secretary to the delegation, Ms Andrea Griffiths, from the Department of the Senate. Ms Griffiths did a sterling job for the delegation, and her efforts went a long way toward making the visit of the delegation the success it was.

         Many Australians visit Hong Kong for holidays, but I would be surprised if most were aware of its present importance as the great contact point between the rest of the world and the People's Republic of China. It appeared to me that most of the expatriate business people I spoke to utilised contact people within the Hong Kong business community to make contact with business leaders within the People's Republic.

         There are a large number of Australian citizens living in Hong Kong, including business people, lawyers, accountants, doctors, hoteliers, lecturers—to name a few of the professions represented—and all of those are no doubt a sample of the wider group of Australian expatriates. A visit to the Hong Kong Legislative Council was very important, and I am sure most of the delegation would agree with the importance of maintaining links between the Australian parliament and the Hong Kong legislature, especially as we move toward 1 July 1997.

         Many quotable quotes have been engaged in by a myriad of writers when they write of China, but one that fits what I am about to say I happened to hear a few days ago.

         Having previously visited China in 1985, I was absolutely astounded by the development that has taken place since that time. Places like Beijing, Shanghai, Xian and Guangzhou seem to be exploding with buildings and civil construction works, including roads, bridges and railway networks. There appears to be an aura of development, certainly in the major centres that we visited, and hopefully this will soon permeate into some of the poorer, less developed regions. With a possible market of 1.2 billion people, the opportunities seem boundless. One example we witnessed which I would say is representative of the situation concerns one of the members of this chamber, the member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson).

         Several years ago the member for Isaacs introduced his company to Guangzhou and joined a Chinese partner. It was the intention of that company, the G.C. Lightburn Electrical Appliance Company, to build a simple washing machine for the Chinese market. A shed was erected for the production plant, and local Chinese, seeing the shed, asked the company to build one for them. For the past few years, the company and its Chinese partners have been busy building sheds, including some large projects. When the delegation visited the production site, no washing machines had been produced.

         Upon seeing that the company had a lathe and grinding equipment, another Chinese person asked whether the company could turn up about 500 motor bike crankshafts. The company obliged. A few months later the same person asked whether the company could provide another 5,000 crankshafts. The company agreed, although it was putting a strain on the limited equipment that was installed. A few months later, the same gentleman asked whether the company could provide two million crankshafts. This has resulted in another Chinese-Australian business commencing in Guangzhou.

         The leader of the delegation, Senator Nick Sherry, has commented on a number of items which I do not wish to repeat. There is one matter I would like to raise, and that is the smuggling of priceless Chinese artefacts from the country—a practice that is widespread. When the Kuomintang left the mainland, they carried with them many artefacts, many of which are carefully housed in Taiwan. Unfortunately, during the Cultural Revolution, many other treasures of China were destroyed. Now we have a situation where large sums of money are changing hands with the smuggling of artefacts, many of them apparently obtained by grave robbers from ancient Chinese tombs. The practice is hard to stop, and I saw at first-hand the problem that exists. These historical, priceless treasures are not only part of China's rich cultural history but also part of our total human heritage. It is important that this not be lost to the scholars of the world or to those who simply appreciate human genius.

         Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the calibre of Australia's diplomatic corps both in Hong Kong and in China, a number of whose members are named in the report. Many of these are gifted linguists and students of Chinese history. From speaking to high ranking Chinese officials, we learned of the high regard the Chinese people have for our diplomatic representatives. I am sure I would be speaking on behalf of all in this House when I thank them for the service they are performing for their country in strengthening Chinese-Australian relationships.

        The provisions of this bill authorise the Treasurer to guarantee payments under a loan agreement in order to help ANL to continue to trade in an orderly fashion or restructure its business interests. Would there not be thousands of businesses right across Australia today that would appreciate this sort of assistance from the government after already dropping about $180 million into that black hole called the ANL? We have seen the government hurtling down the privatisation path and the assets sale path in a lot of areas in recent years using the excuse that it is not core government business, it should not be involved in these activities, therefore, it is selling them. It is selling what it says are Commonwealth assets, but they are really the assets of the Australian taxpayers. But this is not so with ANL.

         At one stage the Minister for Transport was saying that we could not give ANL away; it was not worth tuppence. And here he is pouring millions of taxpayers' dollars into the coffers of ANL. Why? Because once again the unions in Australia—the ACTU and the Maritime Union of Australia—have ganged up on the minister, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the government of this nation and told them what they are to do. The unions have given them their riding instructions on how they will run this nation and how they will spend the taxpayers' dollars in this nation of Australia.

This carcass has a distinctly fishy smell. This carcass has been to the bottom of the harbour and back, or has it been swimming with our national seamen for too long? To emphasise my point about how much this minister likes seamen, I ask members to recall the pilots strike of 1989 and compare it to the recent strikes within the Maritime Union of Australia. The difference in the way this government treated both strikes is clear evidence of where the Labor Party's money is coming from and where the support for this Labor government is coming from. The 1989 pilots strike was met with brutal retaliation by the Hawke government, which brought in pilots from overseas and used the air force as strikebreakers. The justification for this, and it is still very relevant today, was that the pilots were trying to hold the country to ransom with their—wait for it—wage demands which threatened to trigger a national wage break-out and destroy the accord.

         So one could, therefore, expect similar treatment to that handed out to the pilots in 1989. But, no. What this government and this minister were able to do within 48 hours was to give life to any future delays in parliamentary legislation. Within 48 hours this minister had announced an extremely generous package of subsidies and tax concessions to look after the strikers' jobs and their wages. It certainly does not take much brain power to work out for whom the Maritime Union of Australia will be doorknocking during the next election campaign. It will be exactly the same people it did it for during the last election campaign.

Companies in my electorate, because of the economic circumstances, have fallen foul of the Australian Tax Office because of their lateness of payment of group tax or their non-remittance of group tax. They would have loved the federal government to step in and say, `We'll save your employees' jobs. We'll save your organisation. We will waive the group tax'—exactly what has been done with ANL. But, no, the full weight of the Commonwealth, through the Australian Taxation Office, was thrown at those companies. They were put through the courts, criminal charges were laid, the companies were bankrupted and the jobs of those people in those organisations were lost. But not for the ANL. Why? Because the Maritime Union of Australia has kicked the can for the Labor Party for years. It provided them with campaign funds. It goes doorknocking for the Labor Party when it comes time to campaign.

         The handle that has been put on the Minister for Transport is Mr Danger Man. He is Mr Danger Man all right. Let us look at the second part of Mr Danger Man's deal—the guaranteeing by the Treasurer of the debts of ANL Ltd. Members should think about this. It is a big decision to put your name down as a guarantor on any item for any person. It is not something that is done lightly and done every day. Yet what this ANL deal is saying is that you and I, our children and our children's children will act as guarantors for debts of this shipping line, which to date has shown itself to be unprofitable. What this bill is saying is that we in Australia will pay not only the principal debt but also the interest on the net current debt of $180 million. Interest payments start as soon as this bill gets royal asset. Unless the Prime Minister has been able to strike a low interest repayment similar to his pork barrel pig farm, the Australian public can be looking to pay back around $18 million per year—that is $18 million just taken away from the Commonwealth coffers, out of revenue. We have not heard anybody ask the government: who is funding this? Was this in the budget? Is this off-line? Where is the revenue coming from to pay for this $18 million? This bill will not solve the problem in the slightest.

         Ultimately, this outfit is going to have to be sold because it is going to be a continual drain on the taxpayers of Australia. Let us not forget that this is Australia's national shipping line. These are already the taxpayers' ships. So for the government to argue that the extent of the current liability of $180 million is secured against assets of the company is almost ludicrous. Let us get one thing straight. ANL is a public company with one shareholder—the Commonwealth of Australia. To use public owned assets to try to write off a public owned debt is surely not doing anything.

        ANL has the same responsibility that other directors of public companies have and that is to operate the business with propriety, as far as the shareholders are concerned, to protect the interests of the shareholders. We have to bear in mind that the only shareholder in ANL is the Commonwealth of Australia or the taxpayers of Australia. What propriety has been shown in the protection of the interests of the taxpayers of Australia? Mr McGuiness went on to say:

        We operate totally under the Companies Act and all of the requirements of the public companies sections of the Companies Act in terms of reporting, style of reporting, nature of reporting, timeliness of reporting. In addition to that, the shareholder does require that we provide, on an annual basis, a strategic plan which sets out budgets and forecasts. I think that the shareholder also exercises some control via other agencies that we are forced to work through, such as the Loan Council et cetera. But primarily the shareholder being the government is predominantly invisible in terms of our operations.

        I inform the House that at that public hearing on that particular day the shareholder—the government and its representative, the Minister for Transport—were not too invisible. At the public hearing of the Public Accounts Committee one of the minister's advisers was sitting immediately behind Mr McGuiness telling him what he could and could not answer and how he should answer. That was an absolute farce. This hearing was conducted in the middle of the due diligence report being prepared on ANL. It was a very sensitive time—and a very sensitive time for whom? For the Minister for Transport. The minister had one of his goons sitting right behind the General Manager of ANL instructing the General Manager how to answer the questions, and what questions to answer and what questions not to answer. That shows how invisible the minister was at that stage and how responsible he is.

Mr McGuinness, the General Manager of ANL, argued that the strategic direction being taken at that stage would mean that this year will be much the same, if not a little worse.

I understand that, due to restructuring over recent years, crew sizes have come down from 33 to 21. There have already been massive productivity improvements on ships. As well, Jamison Equities, who now owns Australian Stevedores, has rationalised from nearly 9,000 to 3,800 employees in the last few years.

Would people not think that at some stage it would occur to the minds of those who sit opposite that that is not a bad sort of a base to be looking at to see if we can get into the international markets and build up an industry? If there are problems—whether in respect of capitalisation, corporations, distortion of subsidies paid by our competitors or the use of virtual slave ships—could those problems not be addressed?

Out there on the other side of the world—whether they have ships with incompetent crews or exploited and deprived crews, or ships that are operated with very generous special taxation benefits, whatever they are—they are laughing their heads off when they pick up the

         We as a nation ought to be looking to expand and develop our shipping industry. That is what the minister's agreement and that range of measures are about. They are about trying to get some sort of taxation equity in this whole system. The concession, the exemption of PAYE tax, does not go to union members; their net return, their net wage, is unchanged. It goes to the shipping company. BHP, Shell, Ampol or Caltex, whatever the company is, gets that benefit because it is matching the benefit being given by some of our shipping competitors. The benefit does not go to the crews.

         I turn to the other issue of changes to crew numbers. Yes, that is part of the package—that unions and employers look at crew numbers and at reducing crew size. They have done fantastically over recent years, without any problems whatsoever, in going to general purpose crewing. That has all been part of the overall package of trying to make the shipping industry more efficient. But that cannot be done when there are seafarers who are paid, if they are paid, $100 a month and who are not fed, or seafarers working on ships where the shipping companies are exempt from any form of taxation. That is what the government is trying to address here.

Have a look through the performances of all the major Japanese shipping lines over the last six years and see how they have got on. There has been the collapse in international trades because of the international recession. The conference lines are the area where a major part of ANL's troubles have occurred—the conference line to Europe and the conference lines to north Asia. Look at the inroads made by the Chinese shipping firm COSCO, which is one of the organisations which is simply buying foreign exchange, not trading commercially.

The classification society, the freight forwarders, the insurance, the clerical tasks—all the shore based activity associated with the shipping industry. They very quickly realised that they had to do something about it—and they did do something about it.

         —The contribution of the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) tends to indicate that his preselection is showing. We have heard him before—I do know of his personal commitment to Australian shipping and have supported him particularly with regard to the environmental aspects of rust buckets—but he brings a most uncompelling argument to the parliament today. Initially, the ANL Guarantee Bill is to give almost unlimited guarantee capacity to the Treasurer to pass on to lenders who wish to lend money to a bankrupt organisation known as ANL. That is fundamental to this debate. It is a much bigger debate than the future of the Australian shipping industry. If Australian private enterprise wants to go into the investment area of shipping and bring to Australia needed foreign revenue plus competition, the coalition would be very supportive of such a proposal.

The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) should have it all burned on his memory because he used to be the Minister for Transport. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I would well remember when he came to this parliament and told us he had the complete solution: he was just going to throw $160 million worth of taxpayers' money at ANL, and from there on in it would be an example to the rest of the world as to the capacity of Australian shipping to compete. At that point, he did negotiate. Again, he had to go cap in hand to the trade union movement and offer $160 million worth of Australian taxpayers' money with the purpose of reducing manning levels.

He was telling me how they still had a butcher on their boat but they were served TV frozen meals. There was no carcass on board, but there was a butcher. And we wonder why Australian shipping is in the state it is today! The member for Shortland was absolutely true in saying one thing. We are an island nation, one of the greatest producers in the world of bulk minerals and other bulk commodities, including wheat and other products. We hear constant talk about value adding, and one of the simplest concepts of value adding is to ship your own product out of the country.

When we say, `We can ship it in an Australian ship, if you like,' admittedly they play rough pool, too. They say, `We are buying your product. We want to use our ships.' We have proved with gas shipping and a few other things that you can negotiate if you have a product that is in demand.

The simple fact is that overseas consumers will not buy.

It is cheaper to bring the grain from North America; in fact, the freight rate of bringing grain from North America is about half that of buying it off Western Australians. If the truth is known, Western Australian grain growers would be more competitive in Europe, North America or South America with their product once freight is added on than they would be in South Australia.

There have been some very corrupt practices associated with that.

It met all the union demands and its prices were outrageous. Someone said, `Look, I can make a big quid competing with it. I can undercut its prices.' But that person forgot one little thing—the company was never allowed to sail. It had an Aussie ship and an Aussie crew, but every time the ship pulled into the wharf the wharfies would not load it.

        The emergence of new shipping lines in the Asian trades in the late 1970s/early 1980s posed a more serious challenge to the status quo. Again, shippers benefited, although for a while ANL was successful in blunting the competition by lobbying the government.

        He went on to criticise the situation that still exists on our trans-Tasman routes—it is just dreadful. Of course, the member for Shortland and Mr Trebeck make note of the outrageous decision—I see the minister responsible, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), coming into the chamber—that one segment of Australian industry no longer deducts PAYE tax from its employees. The member for Shortland is quite correct. That is of no direct benefit to the seamen; their take-home pay will be the same. But considering that they receive what are pretty high levels of wages—enough, as I pointed out, for one bloke to buy two cray boats—the shipping companies' costs have been dramatically reduced. Some of those wages would attract a marginal tax rate of 45 per cent.

         If that is to be a policy of the government and it is going to treat one business in that way, it is time we looked at a few others. I have already mentioned the drought. The government seems to be totally blind to the circumstances of small businesses in our drought areas, in our regional cities. Anybody who has had only the slightest contact with the rural communities knows that when the rural industry is under pressure the first thing farmers do is get the stapler out and staple up the cheque book. They will sustain their flocks if they can, they will feed their families, they might even—with a bit of luck—send their kids off to university, but they do not repair the tractor, they do not replace the header, they do not maintain their fences to the same degree; they do not make any decisions of a capital nature whatsoever. So they are not making those sorts of purchases in the rural towns, and that means the local small businessmen are sitting there with their staff and no customers.

         What are those businessmen confronted with? They are confronted with sacking their staff. If this government through its drought policy were to apply the same rules to those small business proprietors as they are applying to shipping companies, then perhaps those small businessmen could keep their staff on; they might not have to retrench them. That might be reasonable social policy as well as keeping people in business, but is anybody suggesting that? I have not heard such a suggestion—not a word. The simple fact is that this government has no intention of helping any of those people or their wage earning employees who might be able to be retained in that way.

         I do not believe either proposal is proper. While for small businesses in the country the fuel tax has risen—a very significant factor in their operating costs—it is going to be reduced for the shipping industry. Clearly, there was some benefit in that, particularly when we are told that all of the savings that the local shipping industry had achieved through the reduction in manning levels was gobbled up in one dose of government fuel taxes, of which there was not one mention before the election.

It is a pretty interesting situation that we have a couple of barristers who have been elevated to the status of experts in shipping. I have had a few remarks to make on shipping today, but I would hate to think that I had been given the job of trying to turn a business like ANL around—and at least I had had about 30 years of actual business experience before I came here. I do not think Neville Wran has had any. He is a lawyer. I used to say of lawyers that they do not even run their own business; they leave that to some administrator, usually a mature woman who does it extremely well on their behalf. They are not noted for their administrative capacity, and I could not believe for a moment that anybody in his right mind trying to resurrect the shipping industry would go and employ a couple of lawyers, notwithstanding that at some point in time they gave themselves the label of merchant bankers and they seem to do very well out of government work.

         If you were going to try to save this industry, it would not be a bad idea if you went and got some experts. Of course, the government did have some. In David Trebeck's article, to which I have already referred, he made some response about the capacity of some of the people who were sacked compared with the people who have now been employed. It is outrageous: $150,000 each for two lawyers to resurrect the shipping industry. I do not know how much contact Neville has even had with the shipping industry other than probably to go down for a few donations. I do not know whether or not he picked up the brown paper bags at the Maritime Union, but I have had a couple of interesting stories told as to how much trust he had in his own collectors. I was told first-hand about the day he knocked on some door and the bloke handed him some money—for the good cause of the party; I am not saying it was dishonest—and he said, `And where's the rest of it?' and the fellow went back and got some more. That is a true story. Anyway, that would be about the closest contact he has ever had with that industry.

         He has no qualifications for this task, and at the end of it all the simple fact is that he will come up with some warm and fuzzy political solution aimed at convincing people that more assistance should be given to the line and its intended purchaser, the maritime unions. It will be interesting in only one regard. I would be quite supportive of this thing if it were not for the fact that we were going to pass on a taxpayer funded guarantee, a WA Inc. style deal. The linkage with this is obvious. That is exactly what these people's pals did in Western Australia when they set out to bail out Rothwells bank. They came out with a guarantee of $150 million and then saw it dissipated. So to protect themselves from embarrassment they turned around and created a mock company called the Petrochemical Pickle and borrowed another $450 million. And the taxpayers lost the lot because those people would not even admit to the thing they had done wrong. This has got all the same implications. It has got a Labor lawyer running it when in fact there are competent people in Australia who could have given the government good advice, based on their long experience in the shipping industry.

         —in reply—In summing up on the ANL Guarantee Bill 1994, let me thank all members who participated in the debate. There are a few points I would like to make, basically in response to the member for Hume (Mr Sharp). He said that the bill was unnecessary because the government is the sole shareholder and therefore implicitly the government will guarantee. I can say that he is wrong on both counts. The ANL is a public company, set up by the ANL Act of 1956. It is not a statutory authority and, therefore, under normal principles of company law, shareholders' liability is limited to the shareholding. Therefore, without a specific guarantee the Commonwealth is under no legal obligation to guarantee any debts. We accept the member for Hume's good wishes for the future of ANL, and that is why the guarantee is being given now.

         Legislation is necessary also because of specific requirements in section 70B of the Audit Act 1901. The bill will also guarantee all debts. The bill does not guarantee all debts of itself, but authorises guarantee of repayments of principal and interest under loan agreements. Due to the specific restrictions imposed by section 70B of the Audit Act, other debts and liabilities do not need legislation but may be guaranteed by executive action of ministers without the need for specific legislation.

         The honourable member for Hume talked about market confidence in the company. I would just say to him that, by opposing the bill and opposing the measures I have outlined, the opposition is doing more to shake market confidence than anything the government is doing. What we are doing is actually guaranteeing the debts of ANL and lifting market confidence. The honourable member for Hume said also that ANL has been starved of capital. Since 1983, the government has provided equity amounting to $160 million. In five of the past seven years the company has experienced operating losses before interest and tax, and the company would still be making a significant loss even if it had no debts.

         I turn to the ANL and Australian Stevedores. There has been a lot of nonsense about this following a story in the

         </emphasis>
         last week. I think it was dealt with fairly comprehensively by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) in answer to a question in the House on 8 November, but for the record I reiterate that there was no secret funding deal or questionable commercial practice involved in ANL's sale of its 25 per cent shareholding in Australian Stevedores to Strang Patrick Holdings, which is owned by Jamison Equity. On 9 September 1994, ANL agreed to accept an offer made on 2 September by Strang Patrick Holdings to purchase ANL's shareholding for $28 million—the same price as was accepted by Howard Smith Ltd for its shares. The structuring of the sale agreement was handled by ANL representatives and ANL advised that the sale included a 20 per cent deposit of $5.6 million paid on 9 September, with the balance to be paid within 60 days. There was no cash transfer from ANL to the purchaser. ANL's security for the transaction between 9 September and completion on 4 November was a mortgage over the shares, which were registered with the Australian Securities Commission, and possession of the share certificates. ANL representatives remained on the board of Australian Stevedores until settlement on Friday, 4 November.

         The real issue in the sale of the interest in Australian Stevedores was whether the government would allow itself to be forced to move from 25 per cent to 100 per cent ownership and become the sole proprietor of Australia's biggest stevedoring company. Such a decision would have involved the Commonwealth in a total financial commitment of approximately $280 million in share purchases, contingent liabilities and capital expenditure. Even if the government had acquired 100 per cent of the stevedoring business, this would not have changed the fundamental fact that ANL's shipping businesses were unprofitable even before interest and tax.

        Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the passage of the Racial Discrimination Act. The act was the first specific Commonwealth law on human rights. It was based on the fundamental belief that all Australians irrespective of race, colour or national or ethnic origin are entitled to fair treatment. In this country, we take pride in the community's consensus that everyone should be able to advance through life on their own efforts and abilities; that it is wrong to judge anyone on the colour of their skin or the sound of their accent.

         Be it under a law, or in employment, or the provision of services, or access to facilities and accommodation, discrimination based on racial prejudice and intolerance is addressed by the Racial Discrimination Act. The law provides a remedy to those who have experienced discrimination. It exists because, even with general community tolerance, we know racism exists. And racism leads to discrimination.

         The Racial Discrimination Act does not eliminate racist attitudes. It does not try to, for a law cannot change what people think. But it does target behaviour—behaviour that causes an individual to suffer discrimination. The parliament is now being asked to pass a new law dealing with racism in Australia. It too targets behaviour—behaviour which affects not only the individual but the community as a whole.

         The Racial Hatred Bill is about the protection of groups and individuals from threats of violence and the incitement of racial hatred, which leads inevitably to violence. It enables the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to conciliate complaints of racial abuse. This bill is controversial. It has generated much comment and raises difficult issues for the parliament to consider. It calls for a careful decision on principle.

The bill is intended to close a gap in the legal protection available to the victims of extreme racist behaviour. No Australian should live in fear because of his or her race, colour or national or ethnic origin. The legislation will provide a safety net for racial harmony in Australia, as both a warning to those who might attack the principle of tolerance and an assurance to their potential victims.

         Three major inquiries have found gaps in the protection provided by the Racial Discrimination Act. The National Inquiry into Racist Violence, the Australian Law Reform Commission Report into Multiculturalism and the Law, and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody all argued in favour of an extension of Australia's human rights regime to explicitly protect the victims of extreme racism.

         Since then there has been an upsurge in the activities of extremist racist groups which have resulted in harassment and intimidation of individuals. As well, public gatherings of ethnic communities have been disrupted, sometimes violently. In Sydney, police are investigating seven arson attacks on synagogues in less than four years. In Melbourne, there have been reports of teenage gangs targeting Australians of Asian background. While these incidents are not everyday occurrences, they tear at the fabric of our society and cause immense concern to many of our citizens.

         Racism is often a by-product of ignorance, and education is an essential part of any response. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has a number of programs which target racism in schools, reinforced by a variety of programs run by educational authorities. The commission also provides resources to help employers deal with racism in the workplace. The commission will also be conducting a public education program to promote this legislation upon its passage.

         There is no doubt that the Racial Discrimination Act has been a powerful influence on the rejection of racist attitudes over the past two decades.

         This bill has been mainly criticised on the grounds that it limits free expression and that to enact such legislation undermines one of the most fundamental principles of our democratic society. Yet few of these critics would argue that free expression should be absolute and unfettered. Throughout Australia, at all levels of government, free expression has had some limits placed on it when there is a countervailing public interest.

         Laws dealing with defamation, copyright, obscenity, incitement, official secrecy, contempt of court and parliament, censorship and consumer protection all qualify what can be expressed. These laws recognise the need to legislate where words can cause serious economic damage, prejudice a fair trial or unfairly damage a person's reputation. In this bill, free speech has been balanced against the rights of Australians to live free of fear and racial harassment. Surely the promotion of racial hatred and its inevitable link to violence is as damaging to our community as issuing a misleading prospectus, or breaching the Trade Practices Act.

         The bill places no new limits on genuine public debate. Australians must be free to speak their minds, to criticise actions and policies of others and to share a joke. The bill does not prohibit people from expressing ideas or having beliefs, no matter how unpopular the views may be to many other people. The law has no application to private conversations. Nothing which is said or done reasonably and in good faith in the course of any statement, publication, discussion or debate made or held for an academic, artistic or scientific purpose or any other purpose in the public interest will be prohibited by the law.

         It is worthy of note that New South Wales has had similar legislation for five years and yet no-one has seriously argued that free speech has been curtailed there. Nor has it been unduly limited in any other Australian jurisdictions where similar legislation exists. But perhaps most noteworthy are the experiences in other liberal democracies throughout the world that ban racial hatred and violence. Free speech is a constitutional right in Canada and many European countries, yet the highest courts in these countries have held provisions which ban racist hatred and violence in public to be reasonable and necessary. In fact, in 1989 the Canadian Supreme Court upheld Canada's anti-hate legislation. Recently the Australian High Court has established the existence within the constitution of an implied guarantee of free expression. The High Court decisions have been closely examined and the government is fully convinced that the bill does not infringe on the principles developed by the court.

         Clearly then, while these are important issues, the Commonwealth parliament is not the first Australian legislature to grapple with them. Criminal laws dealing with the incitement of racial hatred operate in New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. Civil provisions are also in place in each of these jurisdictions except Western Australia. New Zealand has had laws of this nature since 1971. Along with Canada, Great Britain and a number of the states of the United States also have specific laws on racial hatred.

         The principle of legislating to deal with racial hatred has for some time enjoyed the support of the leadership of the federal Liberal Party. The former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), in an address to the Zionist Federation in May 1992, said national anti-vilification legislation would be a worthwhile initiative in Australia. The federal coalition's commitment to such legislation was reconfirmed with the release of the Liberal and National parties' 1993 Fightback law and justice policy by the then shadow Attorney-General and now the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello). The Fightback policy document stated unequivocally that inciting fear or damage to people or their property on racial grounds should be prohibited. The member for Higgins reaffirmed this commitment in a letter dated 8 February 1993 to Mr Mark Leibler which said of the 1992 draft legislation:

         In outline, the bill amends the Crimes Act 1914 to provide for three criminal offences and amends the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 to provide for a civil prohibition. The criminal provisions do not attempt to replicate the general criminal law which deals with physical violence and the damage to property. Rather the provisions centre on the precursors of actual violence; that is, the incitement of racial hatred and threats made to a person or persons or property because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin.

         The bill seeks to close a gap in the operation of the current laws by protecting people confronted by situations likely to lead to fear and racist violence. The three criminal provisions to be inserted in the Crimes Act 1914 are set out in clause 4 of the bill. The first two offences deal respectively with threats, done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin, against people and property, while the third prohibits acts done, otherwise than in private, with the intention of inciting racial hatred. I shall speak about each provision in turn.

         Proposed section 58 is quite simple in its terms—it creates an offence which requires a person to threaten another because of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin. While the general law affords protection where a person is the subject of physical threat, proposed section 58 will expressly cover such a person where the basis of the threat is the person's race, colour or national or ethnic origin. Perhaps, more significantly, it will also afford protection throughout Australia in cases where there is no single person threatened, but a group of people identifiable by their race.

         This offence of threatening physical harm to people is based on an assault-type provision—although it does not cover actual battery. The concept of threatening physical harm has been considered judicially on many occasions, and requires that `the person to whom violence is offered, to whom the threat is made, must . . . believe that violence is to be feared'.

         Proposed section 60 creates a criminal offence in relation to the intentional incitement of racial hatred. There are four elements of the offence. First, the offence will only arise in relation to an act done otherwise than in private. I draw the House's attention to proposed section 60(2), which provides a definition of what acts are taken not to be done in private. Secondly, such an act must be done with an intention to incite racial hatred—that is, the offence contains a subjective test. Thirdly, the act must be done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. Fourthly, the act must be one which is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to incite racial hatred—that is, the offence contains an objective test.

The travaux preparatoires to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination refer to `incitement' in the sense of provocation. The travaux also refer to `provocation to violence' against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin.

         The travaux do not define `racial hatred' but it may be inferred by analogy to article 1 of the convention that the term `racial hatred' simply means hatred based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. Thus, the United Kingdom Public Order Act 1986 states that `racial hatred' means hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to colour, race, nationality—including citizenship—or ethnic or national origins. As used in proposed section 60, `hatred' carries its ordinary meaning indicating intense dislike or enmity.

         It is instructive to compare the use of `hatred' in this bill with section 20D of the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act, which refers also to inciting `serious contempt for', or `severe ridicule of', a person or group. This seems to indicate that that act's use of the terms `incitement of', `serious contempt' or `severe ridicule' makes that act in some ways broader in scope than the bill, which uses the term `incitement to racial hatred'.

         Section 20D of the New South Wales Act specifies two things to be included in the means used to incite, namely, where a person threatens physical harm to a person or property, or incites others to so threaten. In this bill, such activity is dealt with by proposed sections 58 and 59. However, it should be noted that if those threats do not incite hatred, either because there is no third party present or that person is not incited to hate, there can be no offence under section 20D of the New South Wales act.

In other words, a person does not necessarily need to actually threaten physical harm to persons or property to commit an offence against section 60.

         I should explain that imprisonment is by no means the only sentencing option available to a court where a person is found guilty of one of these three offences. Where a person is found guilty of any Commonwealth offence, including those which the bill creates, the starting point for a court is found in section 16A of the Crimes Act 1914, which sets out the matters a court must have regard to when sentencing and requires the court to impose a sentence that is `appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence'.

         So, in essence, the difference between the Commonwealth bill and the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act in criminal matters turns on the offence of the incitement of racial hatred. The New South Wales law does not criminalise as such the making of a threat on the grounds of race, but rather covers threats only where they are means by which racial hatred is incited. In contrast, this bill provides that the making of threats on racial grounds is an offence of itself. Threats may often be associated with the incitement of racial hatred. However, in the government's view, a threat to violence is of sufficient concern to be a specific criminal offence even when it is not a factor in the incitement of racial hatred.

        A number of initial points need to be made. First, the provision is civil and not criminal in effect. That is, the process will be initiated by the victim of alleged unlawful behaviour via a complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and not by police investigations. Secondly, like all complaints under Commonwealth human rights laws, the commission will endeavour to resolve the matter by private and confidential conciliation. Only if conciliation cannot resolve the matter is there a public hearing and a determination by the commission. The commission can immediately dismiss frivolous or vexatious complaints.

The difference between the Commonwealth and NSW provisions turns on the description of the conduct giving rise to a potential complaint and the extent of the exceptions.

         Education which attacks the cause of racism is important. I have to say that, as one who has looked at these issues quite closely over time, it cannot be said that legislation has a proven capacity to attack the fundamental causes of racism. I have no doubt that there is a variety of legislation in the states and in other countries, but in all of the discussions I have been involved in and in which I have asked people to produce objective evidence against which I could get measurable outcomes as a result of legislation, it has not been demonstrated to me that legislation has been able to attack and change racist attitudes. It is for this reason that, in addition to looking to draft our own bill, we have committed ourselves so strongly to an educational campaign.

         The coalition sees this bill as an attempt by the government to divert attention from its own policy shortcomings, particularly in relation to economic management. I highlight some of the other matters. There is the increasing gap between rich and poor in Australia with the creation of an underclass comprising the long-term unemployed. There is an obvious concern about increasing interest rates. I think the government wants to take people's eyes off that ball. There is the squeeze that is being put on home mortgages. The one per cent increase in interest rates results in about an $80 a month increase in mortgage repayments. There is also the government's failure to cut the deficit.

Where you have a capacity for free expression, it is less likely that people will engage in other forms of violent activity.

The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommended against criminal sanctions for racial vilification.

In that sense, I suppose he covered the same ground that I will seek to cover. The minister wanted to suggest that, in some respects, the New South Wales legislation was deficient and, therefore, that the Commonwealth went further to cure a defect.

         Some of the differences include `vicarious liability', as the Attorney-General mentioned. The Commonwealth bill introduces a civil head of vicarious liability. This means that employers may be liable for the acts of employees `in connection with' their duties as an employee or agent, even if the employer has no responsibility for the employee's act. The New South Wales act restricts vicarious liability to situations in which the employer has actively—not just arguably, as the Attorney-General suggested as being the difference—caused the employee to act in the prohibited way. That is not just an arguable difference; it is a major difference of consequence.

        The Commonwealth standard of `insult and offend' is both broad and vague in our view in that an extraordinary range of statements are likely to be included under this definition. In relation to the criminal standards, both the New South Wales act and the Commonwealth bill set criminal priorities for threatening physical harm or damage to property on the basis of racial hatred. The Commonwealth bill establishes an offence of incitement to racial hatred, and I read from section 60(a) before.

         In the New South Wales act, incitement to racial hatred is only an offence where it is expressed in the form of incitement to personal violence or damage to property.

         There are other differences which I could take the House through if I had the time. But, in the moments left to me, I will just deal with another couple of examples. In New South Wales, possible instances of serious racial vilification are referred to the Attorney-General by the president of the Anti-Discrimination Board. Prosecutions may then proceed only with the Attorney's consent. Under the Commonwealth's proposed legislation, it would appear that any action would be initiated by the Australian Federal Police. There is no safeguard of a consent provision as contained in the legislation in New South Wales.

         Another matter is that civil complaint provisions of the Commonwealth bill enable complaints to be lodged with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in relation to acts which are reasonably likely to offend, insult or humiliate. This requirement appears to go further than the ground of complaint in the New South Wales act concerning racial vilification. The provisions require an incitement of hatred and serious contempt and severe ridicule before the Anti-Discrimination Board may deal with a racial vilification complaint.

         The Commonwealth complaint provisions would appear to be an attempt to address racial harassment rather than racial vilification as they do not require any element of incitement. It should be noted, however, that the general racial discrimination complaint provisions of New South Wales have been interpreted to include the concept of racial harassment, so it would appear that the type of behaviour the Commonwealth bill addresses could be unlawful under the New South Wales provisions.

         Clearly, the right to free speech and expression is not absolute. As Australians from all backgrounds can appreciate, we live in a nation with a high degree of tolerance towards one another.

The bill is based on the principle that no person in Australia need live in fear because of his or her race, colour or national or ethnic origin. Regrettably, evidence is mounting which suggests that a number of people or groups in our community feel considerably threatened on the grounds of race and ethnic origin and suffer physical, emotional and economic disadvantages.

         As Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I have been in a position to hear a variety of cases of racial hatred against Aboriginal Australians. These include complaints concerning refusal of service and racist abuse, behaviour and harassment in hotels; exclusion of Aboriginal people by local councils from public parks in North Queensland, north-western Western Australia and New South Wales; racist attacks on land council offices and threats of physical violence to similar indigenous organisations; and white supremacist activities in rural and regional towns throughout Australia inciting racist hatred amongst different groups within the community.

         This legislation makes provision to amend two acts—the Crimes Act 1914 and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. It will change the Crimes Act to provide for three criminal offences. These cover proposed sections 58, 59 and 60 of the Racial Hatred Bill. Proposed section 58 makes it a crime to threaten to cause physical harm because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. It provides a penalty of two years imprisonment. Proposed section 59 prohibits threats to property because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin and provides a penalty of imprisonment for one year. Proposed section 60 deals with the intentional incitement of racial hatred in public and is punishable by up to one year's incarceration. This proposed section specifically excludes acts done in private, provided they are not communicated in any form to the public or done within sight or hearing of people who are in a public place.

        The Racial Hatred Bill 1994 shows that the government's commitment to stamping out racial intolerance is not mere lip-service but decisive action. Any fair-minded Australian could see that this legislation will bring about greater racial harmony in our country, and would recognise that it should be supported. On behalf of the workers in the south-western suburbs of Brisbane who currently are suffering from racial intolerance, racial hatred and racial violence, I urge all members of this House to support the racial hatred legislation. I commend the bill to the House.

         The case for the government's racial vilification legislation has been debated in the Australian community over the past months, and the case has been comprehensively lost. In every way, the broad spectrum of Australians have spoken. Their judgment, as commentator Phillip Adams has said, is devastatingly clear: wrong bill, wrong country, wrong time. So we must ask the government: why must we have this debate? Why is this overbearing legislation in front of us? There can be only one answer to those questions, and it is that this is what happens when a government loses touch with the people.

The approach of the coalition, as the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has detailed, is to oppose the Lavarch legislation, to proffer no amendments to a bill which is not repairable, so draconian as it is, as it goes through the House of Representatives and the Senate, and to proceed with an education program of some quantum to help create greater racial tolerance and improvements in the area of racial harmony and tolerance.

Racial vilification is as offensive to Islamic people as it is to Christian people, Judaeo-Christian people—whatever terminology you might like to use—and Buddhist people.

         I say all this because I want to make the point that my own efforts are on the record, and I want to re-state them on the record in the context of the debate on this racial hatred legislation. In this respect, as in my constant and unflinching opposition to the Far Right, my record stands me in good stead and provides a self-evident defence against  those who would seek to place the racist tag on my back or on the back of any member of the parliamentary National Party. In this respect, actions speak louder than words, and that is the way it should be, and should remain, in Australia.

         It is genuinely a very sad occasion that the government, after two years of backing and filling in attempting to draft legislation with regard to racial hatred and racial vilification, has decided to proceed with this legislation. I regret very much that the final product Attorney-General Lavarch has brought before the parliament is much wider in compass and much more overbearing and overarching than anything which could be compared to the New South Wales coalition legislation. It is legislation which, at the federal level, in terms of its encroachment on freedom of speech, Australia simply does not need. I believe the great bulk of Australians feel exactly as I do. On their behalf, I give this message to the House: this bill is unnecessary, unworkable and un-Australian. It is indeed the wrong bill, the wrong country, the wrong time.

         —The Racial Hatred Bill 1994 amends the Crimes Act to make it a crime to threaten violence or destruction of property for racial motives and, secondly, to incite racial hatred in a public place. It also amends the Racial Discrimination Act to allow victims of humiliating or intimidating racist behaviour to take a complaint before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to seek conciliation and ultimately, if necessary, arbitration of their complaint leading to the possibility of compensation being awarded to the victim of the alleged racist behaviour. That, of course, is a civil remedy whereas the amendments to the Crimes Act provide for the creation of two specific crimes: one relating to threatening violence or destruction of property, which is subject to a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, and the other, the incitement of racial hatred in a public place, is subject to a maximum penalty of one year's imprisonment.

         There are gaps in the existing protection that the Racial Discrimination Act provides to citizens in this country and these were exposed in a number of reports, including the Australian Law Reform Commission's report entitled

There have been a number of myths abounding since this legislation was first mooted a couple of years ago and we heard some of them trotted out again by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in his contribution. Perhaps most importantly, there is the suggestion that in some way this legislation constitutes a threat to free speech. In fact, this legislation is being brought before this parliament to protect and enhance free speech—a proposition that the Leader of the National Party may find a bit difficult to understand because it requires some subtlety and some analysis; nevertheless, that is the fact.

         I must confess, as I am sure a number of people on this side of the House would do, that when this legislation was first mooted a couple of years ago the first thing that came into my mind was the issue of freedom of speech—an obvious concern that many of us have, particularly those of us who have had an extensive background in issues of civil liberties, about any legislation that imposes any restriction on what people are able to say. So I made some effort to find out precisely what was proposed in the legislation. When I found out in late 1992 what the government was proposing I decided that there was no threat to freedom of speech because of the very narrow focus of the legislation and the type of conduct that it was focusing upon.

         We all live in a society where there are already many limitations on freedom of speech, such as laws relating to child pornography, which we do not hear complaints about from anywhere in the mainstream political spectrum. The Trade Practices Act imposes restrictions on freedom of speech, quite correctly, in order to ensure that business activity is conducted fairly and honestly. We have laws relating to fraud. We have libel laws. So there are many restrictions on freedom of speech already in our society because freedom of speech is not an absolute.

         This legislation is enhancing freedom of speech. It is protecting freedom of speech. It is protecting the rights of individuals who happen to be of a different racial background from the dominant group in the society to be able to live their lives and express their views and their culture without fear of intimidation, without fear of threats and without fear of having racial hatred and ultimately violence incited against them. It may seem like not a particularly significant point, but it is surely an inhibition on the right of freedom of expression when, for example, people who are Jewish feel unable to display the symbols of their religion, of their culture, because, as has occurred in Caulfield recently, obviously Jewish facilities have been firebombed, people of Jewish origin have been threatened and Jewish graves in cemeteries have been desecrated. That clearly threatens freedom of speech. It quite clearly threatens the right of those people to their own self-expression. This bill targets that type of behaviour, makes it criminal and makes sure that people can be protected from it.

         Contrary to the mythology that has been beaten up about this legislation in many areas, it does not focus on somebody who is just a bit upset because somebody has told an Irish joke or a Jewish joke or because Ron Casey got on the radio and made one of his characteristic statements about Asians or something like that. It does not relate to those sorts of things. It relates only to ultimately a tiny minority of racist statements and the really extreme end of the spectrum where somebody is actually threatening an individual or a group with violence or damage to property or causing serious intimidation or serious harassment to an individual. This could happen in a workplace or to somebody who is involved in running a business or something like that.

         This second civil remedy is very similar to the remedies now available for people who suffer sexual harassment in the workplace—something which I consider to be directly analogous. That in itself now is a restriction on freedom of speech. If a worker in an enterprise sexually harasses another worker—it is typically a male harassing a female, but not always—only by words, and if there is a constant pattern of behaviour, a constant pattern of intimidation and harassment, that constitutes sexual harassment. Civil remedies are available for the person who is the victim of that behaviour. This legislation effectively puts racial harassment in the same sort of category. It allows a civil remedy to a person who is harassed, intimidated and whose life is made hell without any physical assault purely because of their race or ethnic origin. That I suggest does not threaten freedom of speech; it enhances freedom of speech.

         I also think it is worth pointing out that the boundaries of freedom of speech in our society are not a constant. Things change. We have seen recently a High Court decision on the issue of libel, which obviously has implications for people in this place. One area where we have seen the boundaries of what is seen to be acceptable use of freedom of speech in our society change quite significantly in recent times is the extent to which four-letter words or swear words can be published in the media. Words are now used commonly on television and radio and in the print media which 20 years ago it would have been unthinkable to have published. What has happened is that there effectively has been a bit of a change in community standards. This can be compared with what is tagged as political correctness. We are seeing a change in community values so that words such as `chink' or `nigger' or some of those other grossly offensive terms that were in common usage 30 or 40 years ago are now not acceptable anywhere in the community, and they should not be acceptable. People should not be condemned for indicating that this is the case.

         Clearly, simply to say words by themselves should not be the subject of criminal sanctions, but to actually do so in a way that threatens violence, threatens destruction of property, threatens criminal activity or harasses or intimidates somebody is something completely different. To dismiss all of these concerns as just political correctness is facile and juvenile. We are seeing the consequence of a long overdue change in community attitudes in our society, which recognises that people are equal irrespective of their race or gender, they should be treated as equal and our language and the way we conduct ourselves should not show otherwise.

         This bill is not about enforcing political correctness in the way the Leader of the National Party stated. It relates to quite extreme situations.

If a person says on the radio that all Asians should go home or some of the other more extraordinary and ludicrous propositions that are put forward, again this bill has no relevance. But, for example, if at a demonstration outside an area where a large number of Asian people are living a leader of a racist organisation openly, publicly, incites his followers to invade the homes of the Asian Australians, to beat them up or to get rid of them or something, that is covered by this legislation, and rightly so. That is the sort of behaviour that should be the subject of criminal sanctions.

         Equally, if, for example, a shopkeeper from some ethnic minority is being harassed, his business disrupted and he is, in some way, being persecuted by other people because of his race and it affects his business, livelihood and wellbeing, he has a civil remedy under this legislation. The same avenue is open to an employee who is having the same thing done to him or her in the workplace. That is what this legislation is about. It is not about enforcing political correctness or some of the other buzzwords that are thrown about with gay abandon by people like the Leader of the National Party; it is focusing on behaviour that all of us should find disturbing and offensive—something that we would not dream of doing ourselves or even associate with somebody who does it—behaviour that should be appropriately covered by criminal sanctions. I would like to quote what former Liberal Senator Chris Puplick, now President of the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board, had to say about the equivalent legislation in New South Wales.

        This comment and the fact that there is at least one person in the ranks of the opposition who has indicated support for this bill—equally, there are members of the government who indicated opposition to the bill within the caucus—suggest that this is not purely a Liberal versus Labor issue. This is about what I would call old Australia where the white Anglo-Saxon was supreme, the Queen was in her castle and all was right with the world, the environment was a concept that nobody had really heard of and it was our beholden duty, according to the

         Dame Joan Sutherland illustrated this point of view adequately only a few weeks ago. Even though she no longer lives in Australia, she said it was unfortunate that if she wanted to get a passport it might be dealt with by an Indian or Chinese person. The people who are upset are those who are used to seeing this country as a white Anglo domain and who regard people of other racial origins as being, in some way, second-class or not real Australians and not part of our community. That is where the opposition comes from.

         The problem the opposition has in dealing with this legislation is that that old Australia constituency is its core base. There is bit of that in our base too. The opposition is shackled to that base and while it remains shackled to that base it will continue to lose elections. What was mainstream, dominant thinking in Australia in the 1950s is now out on the periphery; it is now a part of increasingly extreme viewpoints. Minority sections of the Liberal Party are struggling valiantly and honourably for a mainstream, middle of the road position which recognises that no longer can ethnic Australians be treated as second-class citizens. Yet most Liberals are happy to accept these people's efforts and contributions to society, but are still quite prepared to allow them to be racially vilified or discriminated against.

         I said in this place a couple of weeks ago that the problem the Liberals have in putting forward this position on freedom of speech is that its track record on civil liberties is not all that good. If we look at the Liberal Party's great guru at the beginning of the 1950s, Sir Robert Menzies, and the infamous Communist Party Dissolution Act and the subsequent referendum, we find that it was trying to give the federal government the power to imprison a person on the basis of being a communist or on the suspicion of being a communist and then requiring that person to prove that he or she was not. That is a fantastic civil libertarian position.

It gives us a chance to build a framework around which a proper education strategy can be built. It provides a foundation for a comprehensive strategy to ensure that all Australians can walk tall in our community, that they can all go about their legitimate business without the fear of racial vilification and harassment and that they can all participate equally as citizens in our society.

         While these reports may have prompted a racial hatred bill, it is difficult to see how their recommendations are reflected in this bill. All three reports recommended against the creation of a criminal offence of incitement to racial hatred or hostility. This bill creates such an offence. The reports favoured the creation of a civil offence of incitement to racial hatred where a high degree of serious conduct is involved. This bill establishes a civil offence with the significantly lower threshold of behaviour which `offends insults, humiliates or intimidates'. These words clearly include the hurt feelings which the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission rejected as the basis for a civil offence, concerned that such a low standard could lead to a large number of trivial complaints.

The first two involve threats of violence and the third refers to an act that is reasonably likely to incite racial hatred. The bill provides that it be an offence to threaten to cause physical harm to a person or group because of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin. The penalty is imprisonment for two years.

This means that the Crimes Act provisions legislating against specific racially motivated offences do not have the effect of overriding state laws. It is therefore possible that a racially motivated threat of violence to people or property could be punished under either the Commonwealth law or a law of the state.

         While statute and common law prevent a person being punished twice for the same act, I ask: what is the need for the creation of a Commonwealth offence where a state offence already exists? The only reason offered by the Attorney-General in his speech was `the serious nature of the conduct to be dealt with by the proposed sections'. That is not a relevant reason if the conduct is already a criminal offence under the laws of a state.

         The third criminal offence proposed to be introduced by this bill is a contentious one. It is the offence of doing a public act with the intention of inciting racial hatred if it is reasonably likely that that act will in fact incite racial hatred. There are several elements to this offence. The act must be done otherwise than in private. The accused must have intended the act to incite racial hatred; the act must be reasonably likely to incite racial hatred; and the act must be done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the person or group against whom the act is done. However, the bill does not require that there be actual incitement of racial hatred.

         The term `racial hatred' is not defined in the bill. The motivation for the unlawful act is to be the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the person or group that is the object of the act. In the context it appears that racial hatred is hatred of a person or group based on their race, colour or national or ethnic origin.

         The first element of the proposed crime of inciting racial hatred is that the act be done `otherwise than in private'—meaning, in general terms, in a public place. The bill defines a public place as:

        As I said, the bill requires that the accused person be shown to have intended to incite racial hatred. This is a subjective test, which means that what is relevant is whether the accused in fact intended to incite racial hatred. This must be proven beyond reasonable doubt, which is the standard of proof required in criminal prosecutions. The act must also be proven beyond reasonable doubt to have been motivated by the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the person or group against whom it was directed.

         In addition to this there is an objective test. The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act was reasonably likely in all the circumstances to incite racial hatred against the other person or group of people. These tests of intention are difficult to apply. For example, the objective test of whether the act was reasonably likely to incite racial hatred would depend to a large degree on the audience. This would commonly be the readers of racist material or the audience of a speech.

         In an English case, a man was charged with inciting racial hatred by responding to the death of an Asian man with the words, `One down, a million to go.' Because the comment was made to an audience of the accused's racist supporters, it was difficult to prove that the words would be likely to stir up racial hatred because racial hatred already existed. In that case the accused was acquitted by the jury.

         It has been the experience in Canada that the word `hatred' is difficult to define and almost impossible to apply in the context of incitement to racial hatred. It is not unprecedented for a court to have to apply a purely subjective abstract concept such as hatred. But it must be possible for the parliament to give the courts more guidance as to what this legislation is aimed at. The Canadian Supreme Court pleaded for such guidance when considering the meaning of the word `hatred' in this context; the court was split over the interpretation of the expression. The minority judges quoted the

        The bill does not properly define `race' in the context of `racial hatred'. There is an indication that the phrase is to cover `race, colour or national or ethnic origin'. It is not clear whether `racial hatred' is intended to include religious hatred. This question arises because in the United Kingdom certain religious groups are covered by the racial hatred legislation and some are not. For example, Jews and Sikhs have been recognised as having an `ethnic origin', while Muslims, Rastafarians and Christians have not. In the outline paragraphs of the government's explanatory memorandum, it is stated that `ethnic origin' is intended to be interpreted as it was in the New Zealand case of King-Ansell v. Police, reported in 1979 New Zealand Law Reports, volume 2. The explanatory memorandum goes on to provide that this interpretation would:

         Under the Acts Interpretation Act, in certain circumstances consideration may be given by a court to extrinsic material—including an explanatory memorandum—if such material is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of a provision in an act. But the Acts Interpretation Act makes it clear that such material is to be considered only in either of two sets of circumstances. The first is where it is necessary to confirm that the meaning of the provisions is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision in its context. The second is where the provision is ambiguous or obscure, or its ordinary meaning is manifestly absurd or unreasonable, and consideration of the extrinsic material is necessary to determine the true meaning of the provision.

         Where precision and clarity of expression are vital in legislation such as this, the role of the parliamentary drafter is an important one. During the weekend I attended a conference on `Courts in a representative democracy'. Among the speakers were the Attorney-General, the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), the shadow Attorney-General (Senator Vanstone) and me; another was the First Parliamentary Counsel, Ms Hilary Penfold.

An unintended consequence of the practice of departmental officers, rather than parliamentary counsel, drafting the explanatory memoranda is that phrases may be used in a sense that were not intended by the drafter—the drafter, but not necessarily the departmental officer, knowing that a court would interpret those phrases in a particular technical sense.

         This bill proposes a civil consequence for the doing of an act that is reasonably likely to `offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate', if one of the reasons for the act is the `race, colour or national or ethnic origin' of the other person or group of people. Differing from the case of the proposed criminal offence of inciting to racial hatred, in this case there is to be no subjective test of intention. This means that it is irrelevant whether or not the person who did the act intended to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate the other person. It is sufficient that the act satisfy the objective test of being `reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate'.

         Australia is a party to two international covenants which relate to racial vilification. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights—I will refer to that as `the covenant'—in paragraph 2 of article 20 provides:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The convention specifically excludes incitement to racial hatred from article 4(a). The article of the covenant I quoted refers to advocacy of racial hatred where that constitutes incitement to hostility or violence. This is clearly much stronger language than that used by the bill. As a result, the bill goes much further in its prohibition than is provided for in the covenant. The criminal offence of incitement to racial hatred and the civil offence of offending a person by an act that was partly motivated by race fall short of racial hatred constituting incitement to hostility or violence. Another consideration is that the covenant contains guarantees of freedom of expression. We must be careful not to lose sight of the objective of freedom of expression that is also enshrined in this covenant.

         Even assuming that Australia's international obligations provide the constitutional support for this bill by virtue of the external affairs power, the bill in its present form may fall foul of the constitutionally implied freedom of political expression. Racist comments that contain an element of criticism of government policy or actions such as immigration policy or administration are likely to be protected by this implied freedom. The bill is clearly directed at certain sorts of speech and, under the authority of recent High Court cases, requires a compelling justification to sustain its validity. If the public interest behind this bill can be served by less drastic measures, then the law will be invalid—and that is a real risk.

The changes to the Crimes Act 1914 provide for three new offences, each with a different term of imprisonment. The first offence is to threaten physical harm to a person because of that person's race, ethnic origin or colour. The second offence is to make threats against a person's property for the same reason. The third offence is to incite racial hatred.

        The suggestion is that the legislation is not necessary. Let me put it into context. Say a racist paints a synagogue with slogans such as: `Six million was not enough', `Death to Jews' and `Hitler was right'. In such a situation the perpetrators can be charged with damaging property, just as they could be charged if they scratched their initials into a telephone box. There is a difference of substance in those two circumstances.

         I was surprised and disappointed at the comments of the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), a recent member of the Australian community and now a member of this parliament. I do not know whether the member for La Trobe was implying with his question on Wednesday of last week that the example he gave did not matter, that it was an expression of free speech and that no civil sanction should be available to him or anyone else placed in those circumstances. He referred to a hypothetical situation of his sitting with his wife in a restaurant and someone identifying his American accent, coming up to him and saying, `I am going to bash you for staring at my wife, you bloody yank. Why don't you go back with all the rest of the septic tanks where you belong?' He may think that is an appropriate expression of free speech; I say very clearly that I do not.

         I believe it would be offensive in the extreme for someone to be sitting in a restaurant with his wife, celebrating her birthday, their wedding anniversary or whatever it happens to be, and to have someone come up and say in a loud, abusive, humiliating, embarrassing, intimidating way, `You bloody yank, get home,' or, `All you bloody septic tanks are the same. Why don't you get back to where you came from?' I believe that if people are subjected to that sort of public humiliation they should be entitled to some sort of civil redress. Some sort of civil sanction should be available to them. It is absolutely disgraceful. No-one should be subjected to that sort of treatment. That is offensive in the extreme.

         This legislation will send a clear, unqualified and targeted message to the vulgar and threatening racists in our society.

It will also indicate to them that legal sanctions may be invoked for those who offend. I think the legislation is necessary for those reasons.

         —I rise to speak in this debate on the Racial Hatred Bill with some mixed feelings. I have no difficulty at all in saying at the outset that I certainly agree with everything that has been said by other opposition speakers and I add my support to the statement that we abhor racial hatred. I am one of those few members who were present when the racial discrimination bill came before the parliament some 20 years ago. The then opposition, the coalition, supported that bill. I find it quite offensive that there is some attempt to portray members of the opposition, quite falsely, as racists in this debate.

         The honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is well known as somebody who has the gift of the gab, who enjoys talking and who does so with some effect. But he is too self-deprecating by half when he complains that there is some charge of political opportunism in this bill, but then proceeds several times in the course of his speech to make politically opportunistic comments about the opposition. I shall return to those sorts of comments later because at the outset of this speech I want to establish my views on the subject of racial vilification or racial hatred. I also want to establish that the opposition is particularly objecting to one clause in this bill.

         I am of that generation which grew up in Australia post World War II and which reached its awareness of political issues in the aftermath of the genocide of the Jews in Europe. As not everybody is aware—certainly a younger generation would not be aware of it—it was actually over a period of years after 1945 that full information came out into the world as to what had happened in the concentration camps and in the gas ovens. There was an atmosphere of utter horror at this demonstration of what extreme racism can do. I am one of a generation of Australians who consequently formed an absolute revulsion for racism. We all hope that the world will never see its like again. That is the origin of my views on racism.

In fact, those who grew up in the families I am talking about—the families of my generation, who would not have justified the actions of the fascists in Europe—nevertheless may have had a different attitude towards, say, Aborigines.

         As this bill has become a matter of fairly strenuous public debate, I have had feedback in recent times from those I know who are of either a different colour or a different ethnic origin, that there is some puzzlement as to why this bill is necessary. I think the great generality of experience is that the bill is not necessary. That is not to discount the extremist incidents detailed by the member for Charlton and the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). Most, if not all, of the types of incidents that have been detailed are actually subject to action under laws as they now stand.

When one hears it, one feels shame, dismay and, I have to say, a sickness in the bottom of the stomach at how the victim of those comments would feel. Surely the best action is to either redress it then and there if there are adults present, or to go to the school concerned and make a complaint. I know that that does happen. Many decent Australians do that. That sort of behaviour, that abhorrence, that feeling that we are all responsible, is a result of education.

        I turned with some interest to the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), particularly as it related to that clause. I read his statement with a mixture of pleasure and disappointment. I am very pleased to see that the Attorney-General has gone to the trouble to include in his speech a number of statements that have been made by leading members of the coalition over recent years on the subject of racial hatred or racial vilification. He quotes the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the shadow Attorney-General (Senator Vanstone). He quotes Fightback, the member for Tangney (Mr Williams)—who has just spoken—and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). All those quotes are absolutely apt. We stand by every one of them. Proposed new section 60 is another kettle of fish altogether.

The government had to be dragged kicking and screaming, after a campaign of many years involving many Australians, before any sort of action was taken. Whilst I am wary of censorship, I accept one can look at it in terms of community norms and objective debate, not just because a section of the community wants it. I do not think one should move too quickly to censor. Therefore I contrast the unseemly haste with which this bill is being pushed through this chamber with its sloth on that other issue, where a very deep and wide concern was well demonstrated by many thousands of signatures on petitions and letters over a number of years.

It grew out of the letter writing to the newspaper and public statements of Bruce Whitehead. It arose at a time when there was the very intensive purchase of real estate on the Gold Coast by Japanese investors. There was great alarm—not because Japanese purchases were involved, but because people were worried about the effect of government economic policies whereby whole streets of homes in Gold Coast suburbs were being sold to absentee investors.

Those people were not interested in hearing a racist message; they were interested in expressing a view on the foreign ownership of property, irrespective of whether they were right or wrong. It did not matter to them whether the Japanese, British, Americans or New Zealanders were involved, their view was the same.

Why does the government not want to talk about the fact that, in the 1990s, the richest 10 per cent of high income earners has gone from 21.9 per cent to 24.9 per cent while the income of the poorest 10 per cent has fallen from 3.5 per cent of our total income to 2.8 per cent?

         —The honourable member is in a somewhat privileged position. She is a member of this parliament, and members of this parliament are not on the receiving end of this sort of racist taunt. I say this to the honourable member for Moncrieff and other members of the opposition: I think it is true that, in the broadest possible sense, there is a higher level of racial tolerance in Australia than in most parts of the world. But, in my electorate, which probably has the largest Jewish community anywhere in Australia, in the course of the last three months there have been two firebomb attacks on a Jewish school, and a Jewish library has been burned to the ground. Today I received a letter from a constituent which I will be happy to table. It reads:

Let me say right from the outset that I do not believe that the honourable member for Bennelong is in any way a racist. But the mere fact that it was raised in this parliament led to a series of racist incidents throughout Australia, particularly in Western Australia and South Australia, where children of Asian origin were subject on buses to attacks and subject to abuse.

         It was only in the early 1980s, when the whole question of Aboriginal land rights emerged, that an ex-communist from Melbourne produced a booklet, `Red Over Black', which tried to prove that the argument for land rights was not legitimate; it was a complete communist invention. The poor chap was out of work at the time. I knew him well. He had been a previous organiser of a union. That document was floated, published by the League of Rights, and endorsed by the then leader of the Country Party as it then was, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. That party sponsored this gentleman's lecture tours all over Queensland. You could go to a small country town, and there he would be saying, `This is not a legitimate argument; this is a communist conspiracy.'

It took six to nine months before the tribunal had dealt with that matter and found that they had been guilty. But that finding did not get half as much publicity as the statements that those commentators made on the radio. Putting it simply, one of the things that we must do is look at the fact that the victims of racist slurs do not have the same rights; they are usually minorities in this community.

This allowed the coalition and, more importantly, the wider community just a few days in which to consider the bill before that debate began.

         The Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 1992 was introduced into the House in December 1992. In the second reading speech, a spokesperson for the then Attorney-General stated that the government `does not have a finally established position on this bill and I encourage all interested parties to provide comment on this legislation'. As a means of enabling this comment to take place, the bill was left to lie in the parliament over the summer recess. That was an admirable way of dealing with a piece of legislation which was of such importance that it necessitated wide community debate. The fact that the coalition and the community has been given less than a week to discuss the Racial Hatred Bill 1994 is indicative of a government which has little regard left for the opinions of the wider community and the due process of the parliament. I think Australian politics suffers accordingly.

         Fortunately, and despite the government's best efforts, I managed to contact a number of ethnic leaders in my electorate to discuss this bill. The opinions I will be expressing are largely based on the messages that I have received from these people. My own electorate is characterised by quite a high degree of ethnic diversity. Over 25 per cent of the people in my electorate were born overseas. In some of the suburbs within my electorate, the percentage of people of overseas origin exceeds 40 per cent. Anyone who has had the good fortune to spend some time in Adelaide will appreciate the vibrancy that exists in inner metropolitan Adelaide.

         Certainly in relative terms the existence of racial violence in Australia cannot be compared with the ethnically based wars that have and are tearing apart countries around the world. However, this is not a good reason to ignore the flaws in our own make-up. The existence of this intolerance has been documented a number of times. Perhaps the most comprehensive and damning report is the report of the National Inquiry into Racial Violence in Australia by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission released in 1991 and the national report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which was released in the same year.

         While racist violence in Australia may not be widespread, it nevertheless exists and we must redress it. In addressing it, I believe there is a role for government. In the past I have stood in this House in support of government efforts to bring Australian laws in line with international human rights standards. In relation to racial vilification, I believe we should again look to the standards that the international community has agreed upon. Australia is a signatory, with reservation, to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The preamble to the convention states:

       </para>

        This preamble states my own thoughts on racism. Racism lives in the mind and in the heart, and I am convinced that this government has failed to put in place the campaign that is necessary to promote ideas of tolerance. These ideas will ultimately show the intellectual poverty of racist arguments. Towards this end, the coalition is committed to putting in place an education program at a cost of at least $10 million.

         To supplement this strategy, I believe there are legislative means by which the existence of racial violence in Australia can be addressed, but this is a task which requires a balancing act of two important principles. It requires the right to freedom of speech to be balanced against the responsibility to protect people from harm, and this is what the government has failed to achieved in its Racial Hatred Bill.

         In the Racial Hatred Bill, the government has been both over-exuberant and draconian. The real problem to be addressed by legislation is the racial hatred or violence which does not manifest itself in physical harm to either person or property. I like to think that, as a community, we have arrived at a point where we understand that we can harm one another in far more subtle ways than through physical harm to either person or property. I think we have matured to a point where we understand that words can cripple people just as surely as receiving a bodily blow. For instance, who would argue that, as long as a man is not beating his wife, he can say whatever he pleases? We all know that perhaps the greatest harm that can be done to a woman is through the constant verbal message to all who will listen that she is the most worthless creature on the face of the earth. The same message can be delivered to Australians of overseas or Aboriginal origin—that, as a wog or a boong, they are worthless.

        Human rights start where civil liberties end. Human rights go beyond the relationship of the individual to the State.

       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, I believe there is a case for the government to intervene in this area. I believe the Racial Hatred Bill is draconian in this area. In clause 4 of the Racial Hatred Bill, according to the explanatory memorandum, the government has created an offence which prohibits acts done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin, otherwise than in private, with the intention of inciting racial hatred if a substantial reason for doing the act is, and the act is reasonably likely, to incite such hatred.

While I can accept that harm can be caused by words, I am fundamentally opposed to the notion that incitement to racial hatred be made a criminal offence in its own right. Making the expression of an idea, no matter how poverty stricken, a criminal offence is a profoundly dangerous precedent for the government to set.

However, I acknowledge that the right to freedom is limited by the responsibility to respect others. I understand Sir Zelman Cowan would explain that the freedom to swing our fists ends at someone's nose. In other words, we are not free to harm others. So far as incitement to racial hatred harms others, I do not consider we have an absolute right to engage in it. However, at the same time, I am convinced that it is absolute folly for the government to believe that it has the sensitivity and insight to police the area of expression. Perhaps the difficulty of policing this area is illustrated by the absence in this field of any definition of the words `incitement to racial hatred'.

         The government is proposing legislation which can send someone to gaol for inciting racial hatred, but it cannot tell Australians what statements fall into that category and will therefore be subject to sanction. A number of reports have specifically addressed the idea of introducing criminal sanctions for racist words that are not affected by existing laws which prohibit threats to personal property. One of these reports was the national report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I would like to quote from a section of that report, since it seems to have been ignored by those who have drafted this legislation. Recommendation 213 states:

        I agree totally with this recommendation. Racial vilification, in spite of the very real harm it causes, should not be a crime, nor should it be ignored. As the royal commission recommended, there is a need for legislation that puts in place a reconciliation mechanism for dealing with racial vilification. In accordance with the royal commission's recommendations, and in accordance with the message it is receiving from many ethnic groups, the coalition intends to put forward a private member's bill to overcome the problems of the bill being debated tonight.

         We would be far more influenced by the New South Wales legislation, which makes it a civil offence to `incite hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of a person or group of persons on the grounds of the race of the persons'. In New South Wales those who incite racial hatred are not imprisoned in the way that they would be if this bill becomes law. Rather the legislation provides a conciliation mechanism which allows for grievance resolution to take place between the victim and the perpetrator. I believe the use of such a mechanism is the only constructive way to deal with the harm that is caused by expression of racial hatred.

         This bill threatens the freedom which underpins Australian life. If this bill were to become law, the right of our ethnic communities to continue their often vigorous rejoicing in their cultural history and heritage would be severely impeded. Rallies by Greek, Vietnamese or African communities, for example, could become subject to prosecution. The use of historic symbols, insignia or flags could also become subject to prosecution.

         Even when people demonstrate and in an orderly way express their views, that may cause some perceived insult or it may be viewed as intending to offend another group with a different view. Earlier this year I marched with my friends in the Greek community as they drew attention to their differences with the federal government on the issue of the former Yugoslav republic. The march was attended by many thousands and was orderly. It commenced in Victoria Square and went down King William Street to Parliament House. On that occasion, Senator Bolkus could not be heard when he addressed the crowd. He could well have felt offended, insulted, humiliated and intimidated. Yet few Australians would argue that the Greek community should not be allowed the freedom to express their views even though their views were strongly connected with nationality and geographic location.

         After listening to the messages of many ethnic communities, it is clear that the government's bill has missed the mark and is considered to be potentially divisive and counterproductive to social cohesion, tolerance and diversity.

Ironically, many in the Australia's ethnic communities came to Australia to escape this very practice. All Australians would strongly support the government in trying to remove from our society the feelings and attitudes that would incite racial hatred. At the same time, all Australians equally believe in freedom of speech and freedom of expression because they are the cornerstones of our society. The government has erred in introducing legislation which inhibits and restricts the freedoms we enjoy today.

         Although the coalition recognises the need for educational programs and legislation to deal with racism in Australia, we will not turn our backs on the many Australians, of whom a significant proportion are Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds, who are trapped into poverty in this country. The ever widening gap between the rich and the poor in this country is a disgrace and a tragedy. To a large extent, this growing gap is largely a consequence of the long-term unemployment that has been created under the Labor government. Figures were recently published that showed 700,000 Australian children lived in two-parent families where both parents are unemployed. Unemployment is concentrating in a small group of have-nots and, as I have said, a significant proportion of this group is made up of Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds. For these people, something more than the Racial Hatred Bill is urgently needed. They need jobs, opportunity and a fair go.

         —As we all know, the Racial Hatred Bill is about racism. It might be worth asking just what that word means. When I was studying history at university only a few years ago I came across this topic on a number of occasions and the definition is generally agreed upon by historians to be a group of people or a person regarding another or another group as less than human, of denying some level of humanity and also to regard that other group as inferior. When a person regards someone as inferior it naturally follows that the person who has that view considers himself to be superior.

         We often hear people saying, `We are not all equal. We are different.' My contention is that difference does not necessarily mean inferior or superior. Some members in this place recently had the privilege of visiting the Austrian embassy for a very entertaining evening. On that occasion we heard a very exciting speaker, an Austrian woman who had been in Australia for a number of years since she was a child and had worked with the Austrian community. One thing that stuck in my mind was when she compared the Austrian temperament with the German temperament. I related to that very strongly because I have German forebears and I recognised a lot of myself in what she was saying. She said that the Germans were very organised, managed and punctilious about timing and so on and that the Austrians were more laid back and relaxed. That obviously gave rise to conflict on occasions.

         Sometimes we are inclined to look at those differences and judge one as being better than the other. I have heard the argument on a lot of occasions both here and overseas that because a group or another person does not do things the way we do or think the way we do, they must therefore be inferior. We have to recognise and accept that other people are different.

         Lots of people in this debate so far have talked about the tolerance in Australia and the fact that we have one of the most multicultural and peaceful countries. That is absolutely true. When we are talking about racism in Australia, it does bear looking back at history to see some of the racism that has existed in this country—to a violent extent in fairly recent times. The history of Aborigines since white settlement is the most notable. Throughout the early days of settlement there was a great deal of hatred, vilification and violence by the European settlers against the Aborigines. There were also wholesale massacres. The Myall Creek massacre comes to mind because it is the only one where white men were brought to trial for murdering Aboriginal people. It was not isolated; it was one of many. In that case, we had a great deal of media coverage. There was absolute outrage that white men could be brought to trial—some of them were hung—for killing what they considered to be animals; they were called monkeys on many occasions. We often need to be reminded of that. When we look at the state of Aborigines now in many places we have to remember that heritage which is still in the living memory of a number of those people.

         Those who were not outwardly hostile to Aboriginal people were often paternalistic. I think paternalism is a form of racism as well. It is saying, as I have said in the definition, that these people are inferior and, therefore, we must pat them on the head and look after them. A lot of our so-called protection laws in colonial times were a reflection of the paternalism which was born of that feeling of superiority/inferiority of the two races. As we know, it was used in those times as an excuse for genocide. It was used as a reason for clearing land so that white people could take up land previously occupied by Aborigines. It also gave rise to a system of taking children from their parents, which was particularly prevalent with children of mixed blood. The stated reason at that time was that, where children had some white blood, if they were brought up in a white community, then the white blood would somehow come to the fore. We could not change the colour of their skin, but with education we could change their attitudes to white ways.

         A lot of people in those times were influenced by something that was called the great chain of being. This graded human and animal life on a scale. According to the then very superior British people, the Aborigines were very low on that chain of being. They were a little above the great apes. I think the Hottentots were down near the bottom as well.

         It was also called social Darwinism. it took Darwin's theory of evolution and applied it to the human race and said that people who were primitive, as the Aborigines were considered to be, were in an earlier state of evolution and that they would eventually die out in the face of a superior race. There was a phrase then that was used along the lines of `smoothing the pillow of the dying race'—if we looked after them, they would eventually die out.

         Australia faced problems with racism when people of different races started coming into this country. The first great example of that was the Chinese who came into Australia first of all to take some of the jobs on the land when many of the farmers of those days rushed to the goldfields. Of course, the Chinese saw that there was some money to be made there too, so they also went to the goldfields. With that intensity of population and with the industrious ways of the Chinese, they often outstripped their European counterparts. There were riots and the famous riot at Lambing Flat was one of the most prominent. Abusive language as well as violence was predominant.

         Many speakers in this debate tonight have alluded to racial violence overseas. The Holocaust in Nazi Germany is one of most prominent examples. Of course, it was not just the Jews that suffered; it was also the gypsies, people of other races and people who were thought to be homosexual. So there was that kind of attitude. Often we use as an excuse for this behaviour, `Well, it was just the attitude of the times.' A reading of history will show us that that is not necessarily so. There were some humane, non-racist people with the First Fleet. Anyone who has read the diaries of Watkin Tench will realise that he tried very hard to understand the Aborigines, to learn their language and to appreciate them as human beings.

The neo-Nazis that are now languishing in prison in Western Australia could hardly be regarded as martyrs.

          The bill is nonsensical in much of what it wants to achieve, although I do agree with some aspects of it. It is unnecessary, and it is certainly opposed by most Australians.

         —One poll I saw suggested that 93 per cent of Australians were opposed to this sort of legislation. We have had several years of this government's drafting it, and suddenly it dropped it on us a few days ago. The previous speaker says that we have had plenty of time to look at it because we knew it was coming. Sure we knew it was coming, but we did not know which form it would take. It could take many forms—some of which we would support, some of which we would violently oppose, and some of which we would moderately oppose. If this government had been fair dinkum, it would have consulted with us and would have given us at least a two-week look at it before it was debated in this House. The Australian people have also not been largely consulted on it.

         I remember when the government brought in its draft bill back in 1992. Numerous submissions—646—came in commenting on that bill. The figure for those opposing the bill was 563, or 87 per cent, and the figure for those in favour of the bill was 83, or less than 13 per cent. So I do not think it is correct for the minister at the table, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), to say that there is general support for this.

         Like other members of the coalition I have seen no evidence whatsoever presented to this House that there is a need for this bill, even though—like all members in this House—I am offended and embarrassed by and find repugnant any acts of racism not only in this country but anywhere in the world today. If the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) had wanted to bring legislation of this nature to the House—recognising the fact that the states primarily have control of criminal law—I thought he would have done what he is presently doing, quite correctly, with the female genital mutilation legislation. Rather than overriding the states through international treaties, he could have gone to the states, consulted with them to see whether they would bring in their own legislation, and if they refused he could have brought it in. Why is he not consistent and doing it with this legislation?

         Already in New South Wales we have legislation on racial vilification, and we have it in Queensland, Western Australia and the ACT to a large extent too. That is a good basis to build on. He also says when challenged that it will be largely impossible for people to be prosecuted under this present legislation, and that at least it is there for an educative purpose. I am surprised he is using that reason, because he denied the Tasmanian government the use of that reason on the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill.

         The Racial Hatred Bill is based on race, colour, national or ethnic origin; it amends the Crimes Act of 1914—adding three criminal offences, which I will talk about shortly; it amends the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975; and it adds a civil prohibition on acts likely to offend, humiliate, insult or intimidate people. I will come to that section later. In relation to the Crimes Act additions, people who threaten to cause physical harm to others based on race will receive two years in prison. Those who threaten to cause physical harm to property—as opposed to person—based on race, will receive one year in prison. I note here that the actual action of causing physical harm to property or to human beings is not covered at all, because the Attorney-General believes that that is already covered in state legislation. It so happens that threatening to do these things is already covered in state legislation. Even the Parliamentary Research Service in its

        In my own state of New South Wales, section 199 of the Crimes Act 1990 provides that, if you are going to threaten someone's property, you are liable for imprisonment for five years. Under this legislation that the Attorney-General is bringing in, you are going to be liable for imprisonment of one year. In other words it could be seen that racially motivated crimes to threaten property are going to be treated less seriously than crimes motivated by other reasons. Surely that is a pretty ironic thing to be happening.

         I do not object to those two sections of the bill at all—except I think that they are redundant because of state legislation, particularly in my own state. What I do object to is the section of the bill which is headed, `Prohibition of incitement of racial hatred because of race, colour or national or ethic origin'. It says:

        I notice that there are no exemptions at all to this incitement. Apart from the fact that I do not know how, in trying to convince a jury, those subjective tests could be tested in the courts, I think the High Court, if this section were put to it, could well throw it out because in some areas it violates freedom of speech—and let me point out where. In the act of making a statement or report which is true, being a report either of an historic event or of current events, the maker of the statement can still be sent to prison if the statement was reasonably likely to incite racial hatred and was intended to incite racial hatred.

         What do I mean by that? There are quite a few ethnic publications around—and many have crossed my desk over the years—that have reported atrocities having been inflicted by other ethnic groups with whom they are in conflict. If a Croatian or Bosnian newspaper came out listing Serb atrocities and saying what dreadful things these were and how the Serbs should be put in their place for these atrocious acts, under a literal reading of the legislation, as I read it, that could be causing these Bosnians or Croatians to be incited against the Serbs, even though what was said might well be true. These people, it seems, could be thrown in the clanger. That seems quite incredible. If this sort of legislation were on the books and literally interpreted in, say, 1939 in Australia, probably much of what was written in this country against the Japanese in World War II could not have been written. If it had been, editors would have been thrown in gaol. So I do think this is a gross deficiency in the bill.

        I have asked a number of members in this parliament whether they can explain to me what that exactly means: why should the racial connotation in things that you are doing wrong take predominance over the others? Nobody has been able to give me a valid reason as to why that is so. It would seem to me that, if you create an act that violates on race and one that violates for other reasons, the one that causes the greatest transgression should be the one that is clamped down on. I have already mentioned how in New South Wales you can spend five years in gaol for threatening to damage people's property, whereas with this legislation the penalty is the threat of only one year. There is a conflict there. There is no explanation in the bill, where it is in conflict with penalties in state legislation, as to how this will be resolved—whether penalties will be added on, served concurrently, or whatever.

From my literal reading of that, you will not be able to tell Irish jokes; Irish people, for that matter—and I myself am part-Irish—will not be able to tell Polish jokes. So, if it is the case that people can do this, where in the explanatory memorandum or in the legislation does it say they can?

Exemptions are given under of the Racial Discrimination Act for artistic work, for genuine academic work, for scientific work, for fair and accurate reporting of an event which happens, and for fair comment of a genuine belief held. That seems to me, in one sense, to give carte blanche to those who incite hatred against Jews, provided that it falls into one of these categories. That seems a little strange to me. I cannot quite understand that. In the explanatory memorandum on pages 10 and 11, it states:

        So, if someone goes out on the street and says, `Jews are inferior people,' and if they genuinely believe that and it is an extreme view—which it is—even though everybody in this chamber would find that repugnant, according to this legislation, it would be exempt.

But if I said that these people ought to be despised, sent back to the country they came from and should not have come in on the particular visa on which they did, who would be charged? Under a literal reading of the act, it would not be them; it would probably be me because I had disparaged them on ethnic grounds. We had David Irving, that pseudo-academic scientific person who said that the Jews were not killed in the war, there was no holocaust, and all that type of thing, wanting to come out to Australia to tell that to the Australian people. This government banned him from coming into this country. You can argue both ways as to whether that is good or bad. But according to the explanatory memorandum, extreme views, if genuinely held, now are allowed to be preached in good faith. With the enactment of this legislation, perhaps the government would not be able to ban this fellow coming into our country. I do not know, but that is how it seems to read to me.

I looked up the press releases to see what they had done. They were prosecuted for violence, but the things they said—`Speak up against race laws' and `Say no to an Asian Australia'—would be permitted under this bill.

         I believe the Racial Hatred Bill is an insult to Australia and Australians. It is an absolute disgrace that it has even been brought before the parliament and it will be an infamous day in our political history if it is passed. This is one of the most draconian pieces of legislation ever brought before the parliament in peacetime. It is in the same class as the Communist Party Dissolution Bill, and the case for it is shot through with mendacity and misrepresentation. The fact that this bill is before the parliament and may well be passed says a great deal about our political leadership.

         Our system has always been able to cope with corrupt individual politicians, but when entire political parties have been intellectually corrupted the system begins to break down.

         The elites who have been pushing these policies realise that, even though they dominate the bureaucracies and academia, they are losing the intellectual argument. Their crude cries of `racist' and `racism' are proving less and less effective. Now they want a piece of legislation to compliment the declining power of the social sanctions against speaking out. It can be observed that one cost of increasing the cultural and racial diversity of democratic nations has been a decline in the ability to speak freely. We are moving from a democratic to an authoritarian model. We are urged to integrate with Asia, and of course the Asian model is authoritarian.

         This is the second attempt to get this sort of legislation through. The Racial Vilification Bill 1992 was introduced to parliament in draft form at 8.01 p.m. on the second last sitting day of the year, 16 December 1992. In other words, it was done in such a way as to bring the minimum of attention to it. I, along with former Senator Peter Walsh, spoke out strongly against the proposed bill. As far as I can recall, we were the only two federal politicians from either side to do so.

         The bill in its draft form was also a disgrace. Even gestures and the wearing of politically incorrect T-shirts were made illegal under the bill. The civil section of the bill would have been administered by the Race Discrimination Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, then Irene Moss, one of the people who most strongly pushed for the bill. The bill closely followed the recommendations of her report into racist violence, which is little more than an exercise in Anglo bashing. There is no doubt who this sort of legislation is aimed at.

         by the Law Reform Commission, then under Justice Elizabeth Evatt. It is clear in the texts that there was networking between the authors of these reports. However, both the latter reports recommended against criminal sanctions. Only the report of Irene Moss supported criminal sanctions which were contained in the 1992 draft bill and are also contained in the 1994 bill. I would urge interested academics who still care about free speech to analyse this Moss report closely, because this document, which I believe to be intellectually corrupt, is the main justification for federal racial vilification legislation.

         It was only at the very end of 1992 that the Attorney-General's public affairs section was brought in to coordinate the selling of the bill to the media and to organise a public consultation process. There was no proper submission process in place until then. It was clearly an afterthought. Advertisements appeared in early January 1993 letting people know that a submission process on the bill would be conducted and offering to send people copies of the bill, the second reading speech and a fact sheet. The written submission process, however, was held over the holiday break when most people would be thinking about anything else but politics, or perhaps so it was hoped.

         The Attorney-General's Department also tried to fix the result of the travelling consultation process by holding meetings in venues of groups most likely to support the bill, such as ethnic affairs commissions and so on. It also sent out letters asking these organisations to mobilise their members—that is, likely supporters of the bill—to be at the meetings. The attempt to stack the meetings, however, seems to have been largely unsuccessful. At any rate, due to the timing of the March 1993 election, the draft bill was wiped from the slate, but not before the bill had provided the model for bastard children in the form of a section for the broadcasting codes for television and immigration changes. These immigration changes were used to block controversial historian David Irving from entering Australia.

         Ethnic lobby groups continued to push for a racial vilification bill after Prime Minister Keating was re-elected. As the draft bill had been wiped from the slate, a new bill would have to be introduced. There was also of course a new Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch.

The outgoing President of the ZFA, Mark Leibler, was one of those who had most strongly pushed for this bill, with criminal sanctions. The choice of venue for the announcement underlined from where the major lobbying pressure for the introduction of such a bill had come. Of course, other ethnic lobby groups and academics have been involved and Aboriginals have been used as a stalking horse, but the main driving force has clearly been the Zionist lobby.

We had, amongst the southern Europeans, sufficient Italians to make up a good team. We needed two more teams and the Yugoslavs said that they could provide two teams. They did not bother to tell me that one was Croatian and the other was Serb. It was all right while they played the other two teams, but when they played each other there was blood on the floor. Both teams got to the grand final because they were very good soccer players, and they beat up the best player from one side one night in front of the picture theatre so he could not play the next day. Workmates!

         The government is suggesting that that activity is okay. It is not true and it cannot be condoned but the government is saying that, if you are one of them, you are protected from this; this bill is here to protect you. Those are the sorts of things they do to each other. Of course we could extend it way past that with other examples. I hope the government and its provincial lawyer are prepared to go out and say, `This is for everybody.'

         —Thank you, I am intrigued to hear the member for Werriwa say that it is for everyone. If you read the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne tomorrow, and the speeches of a couple of others, you would get the distinct impression that it is there, one might even say, to divide this community but, most importantly, to say to one group of people, `This is for you.' The previous parliamentary secretary told me how this is a great victory for the Labor Party because all the ethnic interests, whoever that might mean, are going to come out in favour of it because they will be getting the protection. In fact, under two categories, I predict that if and when this bill actually brings someone to court, it will probably be amongst those groupings that carry out their inherited hatreds, which I predict can only be removed in this society by a process of time.

         This is a very important aspect that must be understood by the ethnic communities. They are not quarantined from this legislation. When they discover the extent to which they might be prosecuted for it, or where one richer person might decide to take a civil action and send the other fellow broke because he has some revenge to take out upon him, then I think you might find out how dissatisfied people are.

         I also want to touch on another aspect of what we are doing here. This is the second piece of legislation where I have raised the same criticism. I learnt something from the first piece of legislation, because I made some public remarks. I heard a journalist—journalists sit in judgment on us; they are experts in everything—tell a radio commentator that I did not understand the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, which is four lines long but which has universal coverage as it includes everything. She quoted a great authority; she quoted the explanatory memorandum, because she thought it was the law.

         In the short title of the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, you refer to sexual conduct, but no definition of sexual conduct is given.

         We have gone down the road of creating two totally imprecise pieces of legislation. There is absolutely nothing that can give members of the public any certainty in what they might do. It is a lawyer's dream. We are running around one day trying to cap compensation payments to try to get control of the legal profession but, as fast as certain steps are taken, you create this sort of legislation.

         Of course it goes further. Some people have objected to the use of the word `hatred'. Is it not interesting, because we find that our legal advisers, in providing us with this
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Bills Digest
         </emphasis>
         , seek to comment on the meaning of `hatred'. What do they tell us? They say:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        As noted in the above in the Background, the international instruments, which form the constitutional support for this Bill, avoided reference to `incitement to racial hatred', on the basis that `hatred' is too subjective a term for a court to assess. In the United States and Canada, concern has also been expressed that the term `hatred' is too uncertain a standard to include in penal legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the courts do not know how to interpret it but ordinary citizens facing two years gaol have to know what it means. The
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        </emphasis>
        states:

        For example, in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         State v Klapprott
        </emphasis>
        , the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that a statute that made it an offence to utter any statement inciting hatred, abuse, violence or hostility against a group by reason of race, colour, religion or manner of worship, was void for uncertainty, because the terms `hatred', `abuse' and `hostility' are abstract and indefinite.
       </para>
       <para>
        So why can you not give people some advice on what you mean? If you are going to put people in gaol because of an act that is defined as hatred, it would seem reasonable to put within this legislation a definition of hatred—just as I say in your previous legislation you should have put in a definition of sexual conduct. I know why you avoided it. But we have this jumped-up provincial lawyer who, according to the honourable member for Macquarie (Mrs Deahm), is giving us his document, his package, that tells us what these brief statements mean, what the consequences might be. The more considered view is that we will never know until somebody argues it out in the court. Of course, there are precedents that say that your use of the word `hatred' will make it almost impossible to gain a conviction. That is what we are told. You must know this. You have the whole Attorney-General's Department behind you and you come in with rubbish legislation that leaves the people of Australia with no idea whatsoever what you mean. That is an outrage. It is doubly an outrage when you are talking about people's liberty.

Let us put that aside for a moment and ask ourselves two questions: in all of this, considering some inherited hatreds that exist between various of our more recent ethnic arrivals, what have we done for them with this legislation, other than to put them at grave risk for things they say in their churches and other places like that, and which no doubt at their own internal political rallies they have probably been saying about each other for centuries? If someone takes offence and has the money, will he drag those people before a tribunal? I have grave concern about this further extension of the powers of the tribunal.

         My concern about tribunals is that they neither operate under the proper rules of justice nor do they seem to take any account of proper cross examination of anything. In the area of sexual harassment, a case has just concluded recently in Western Australia. An absentee hotel owner was found guilty of sexual harassment—by the way, we have in this a vicarious liability of employers. This poor devil was in Perth whilst his hotel was operating in Kalgoorlie. His customers apparently made some lewd gestures to a couple of female entertainers and the tribunal hit him for $45,000 damages because of his apparent failure to anticipate, presumably by mental telepathy, that that night his customers were going to get drunk and make some lewd gestures to some women who were standing up on a stage in some state of undress, possibly, and encouraging it.

Come back some time with something that the people can reasonably understand, that gives the courts proper instruction and that does not create all these opportunities for people to be harassed through the law, and we may give it some consideration.

        (3) Under the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 the DAA may either grant or refuse an application for registration. The DAA may also refuse to consider an application unless the applicant gives information requested by the DAA. The Act provides for an applicant to request the DAA to reconsider a decision of the DAA (including a decision to refuse an application). Also, an application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of decisions of the DAA (including a decision to refuse an application). Apart from these avenues of appeal, the DAA is not empowered to offer unsuccessful applicants an opportunity to reapply once the deadlines for applications have passed. However prior to the closing dates for applications the DAA Secretariat practice was, to the extent possible, to advise applicants whose applications were in non-complying form to resubmit a conforming application by the statutory deadlines.

        These estimates are being revised and reviewed as the timing of project investment becomes available. I have been advised by the Authority that the stream of company income tax deductions as a result of the development allowance started twelve months earlier than forecast in One Nation, and although the company tax rate has recently been reduced to 33%, the value to proponents of the revenue foregone over the years covered in the One Nation estimates is now more than twice that included in those estimates.
