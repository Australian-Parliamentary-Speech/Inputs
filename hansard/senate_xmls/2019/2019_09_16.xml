                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  One of the most upsetting issues in our country is the break-up of families and the heartbreak that happens for the children, the grandparents and the extended family members. People get married and have relationships because they're in love with each other and want to spend the rest of their lives together, but that is not always what happens, and we have break-ups. I am one of those people who have had marriage break-ups—in fact, of two marriages. I thought I was going to be married for a long time. From both marriages I had two children. So I speak on this matter from personal experience. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When my first marriage broke down, I had parents who never saw the children—didn't want to see the children. In my second marriage, the stepfather was not very kind to the two children from my first marriage, so hence my marriage broke down. It was also from domestic violence, although it wasn't physical domestic violence; it was because of alcohol abuse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I know what it's like to go through it as a wife, as a mother and also now as a grandmother—watching my children go through the same issues. I've not been able to see their children, who they're fighting for—a parent denied the right to see their children, for no reason other than that a nasty custodial parent is denying them that right. These are the children that they brought into the world, laughed with, bathed, saw the birth of. You can never take that away from a parent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what I say to a lot of parents out there for whom at one time it was love, happiness and a life together and now it is hurt and pain. I say to these people: get on with your lives; move on, because it must wreck you, tear you apart. The only people who make gains out of this are the lawyers and solicitors or family who are egging you on to keep going with the whole problem. My main issue—and I'm very grateful to be a member of parliament in this place—is to be a voice for the many parents out there who feel they're not being listened to and not being heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Family law was brought in in the 1970s to deal with divorce issues. But now I see it as a failed system that is not working in many cases, or even most cases. We have children in our society who are denied the right of seeing their parents, are going through psychological problems and have issues—drug addiction, suicide, self-hate—and we've got to put it all down to something. What I hope to do in moving this bill today is draw attention to it—that we can actually look at ways of improving our system to help those parents and children out there to come to a unified, equitable decision that will help them get on with their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Family law in Australia needs a major review from a practical, non-legal perspective to overcome lengthy delays and costly court actions in an antagonistic, confrontational system. Australians have been forced to ensure the pitfalls of this hugely dysfunctional system for decades. Delays inside the court system are up to six years in some instances in relation to hearings and decisions. Delays outside the court system average 23 months. Whilst it is my opinion that the entire family law system and laws require a holistic view, I am introducing this Family Law (Self-Assessment) Bill 2019 as a measure to overcome those various areas of confrontation and costs which I just mentioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to help speed up the resolution of relationship, property and parenting disputes both for couples who cannot afford to go to court and for those who can. Part 2 of this bill creates a new obligation on divorcees to disclose their financial affairs in a simpler and more convenient way, and to divide assets accumulated during the relationship by paying minimum, incontestable sums promptly. It is my belief that those assets that either party brought into the relationship should remain theirs when the relationship separates. I will say here that I'm speaking from what I put into practice. When I left my second husband I walked away from the family home, because that was his home that he had prior to marrying me. He worked for that very hard, as an apprentice plumber. He saved for that block of land and he built the house. Therefore, I didn't feel that I had a right to that house. This will stop those gold-diggers who only come into a relationship for what they can get out of it. To those people who have not contributed to it: I believe in prenup agreements. If both parties agree that they should split their assets that they've accumulated over the years, so be it. But if you bring into a marriage an asset—your land or a house—that was yours prior to that marriage, that should be yours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compliance under this bill applies to Australians regardless of wealth or a trip to the Family Court. A statutory timetable of nine months and a series of minimum payment obligations are created. The bill deploys the same broad method of financial self-assessment that former Treasurer Paul Keating invented in relation to income tax and that former Treasurer Peter Costello perfected in relation to GST. The bill requires that each spouse self-assesses a just and equitable division of the couple's relationship wealth and pays up-front to the extent they are not in conflict rather than when all matters are finally resolved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of court decisions never order less than 35 per cent of a joint property to any individual party. Therefore, separating couples will have obligations to shrink their dispute to balance 30 per cent of their relationship wealth and put the residual money in a joint bank account while they negotiate or mediate. The disclosures will occur at no cost to government. Mediation on financial matters would thus become compulsory in much the same manner as mediation on parenting matters is compulsory under current law, as a result of the reforms enacted by all parliamentarians in 2006.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, that mediation does not work in most cases as a result of the court system as some parents do not see the children at all. Research shows that compulsory mediation already works to resolve eight out of nine relationship disputes. Introduction of this reform is the economic equivalent of (1) appointing 26 new federal court judges, (2) giving back to separating couples, on average, 450 days of their lives that are currently taken up with payment delays, and (3) quadrupling the effectiveness of Relationships Australia for middle-class Australians. Reducing financial tension in this manner would have more real-world impact on the number of instances of reported family violence disputes than all of the laws passed and all of the funding approved by this parliament in this parliamentary term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will help restore the original intent of family law legislation—that is, to ensure that calmness, rationality, low cost and speed prevail. This bill does not change the Family Law Act. It just makes the law applicable to all by flipping the compliance burden from the state onto the shoulders of the financially stronger spouse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 3 of this bill will require spouses to each abide by the existing laws on shared parenting. It will require parents who do not wish to comply with shared parenting to explain the reasons why and to mediate regardless of going to court. The existing exemptions for domestic violence remain in place and are bolstered by a number of other more robust exclusions to assist legal aid organisations to be more effective. Custody should be a strict fifty-fifty, except for some alleviating factors: if one of the ex-partners has a criminal record, if one of the ex-partners has a drug offence record or if there is a domestic violence order already in place prior to separation. These three factors are the only circumstances why they may not receive 50 per cent of the custody, but, apart from that, the fifty-fifty custody should be immediate upon separation, with the details worked out via mediation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why I talk about fifty-fifty custody is that it is in the legislation, but it's up to the discretion of the judge. I think that it is wrong that parents can be joint parents prior to separation but the next day a parent is denied access to see their children because the person who ends up with the children denies them that right. Then they have to go through the court process to actually see their children, and it goes on for months and months—and sometimes the parent with the children will even go where the other parent can't see them. This should not be allowed to happen. Upon separation, there should be fifty-fifty custody automatically, unless they have a criminal offence—not a drink-driving charge, but a criminal offence that carries with it at least a six month sentence—or they have a drug or alcohol problem or there is a domestic violence order already in place prior to separation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have people in Australia who are suiciding. It's estimated that three men a day and one woman a week are suiciding. This is not good enough. If we are the legislators of this nation, we should start looking at how to solve this problem. For too long it's been disregarded and ignored by this parliament and previous governments. It is my aim to push for change. This is a way of looking at it through mediation—that you make these people sit down; they have to mediate. Too many lawyers and solicitors are making a good living out of this. They are dragging these cases on at the expense of people having to sell their homes and walk away with virtually nothing. At the end of the day, the ones that actually go through the court system and get no justice cannot appeal, because they can't afford to take it back to court. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reducing financial tensions in this manner would have more real-world impact. Ex-couples need to sit together, work out when they will each have their turn to look after the children and get on with it. Parents with reasons to deny standard shared parenting contact hours must state these reasons in a parenting self-assessment notice. Parents—and that most often means the mother—who have no reason and simply use courts to delay the inevitable will be subject to fines, as applies in some other jurisdictions. It is my opinion that, if there is no justifiable reason for the delay, they should lose legal aid or pay the other party's costs. Lawyers who encourage their clients to make false allegations and claims and drag out proceedings should be heavily fined or lose their licence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to be tough on this, because someone has to be. What is happening with family law is devastating our community and our society and, unless people are held responsible for their actions, nothing will change. The economic consequences will be a marked reduction in parenting disputes. This bill will thus enable cases with actual domestic violence, as opposed to alleged domestic violence issues, to get priority in the courts. The time for talk about good intentions is over and the time to act is now. There should be fines for those who make false claims of violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where there are no real issues of conflict, the bill requires attendance at an anger management program. These programs are widely used in New Zealand and do a much more effective job than does standing around aimlessly in court foyers. More education and less litigation is in the best interests of everyone impacted by separation—in particular, the children. This bill will also greatly reduce legal fees, which often absorb all the assets of separating couples. This bill will minimise the necessity for legal advice as was recommended by the Productivity Commission report commissioned some years ago. Family law has long been one of my priorities, and I will keep fighting until I see equitable and balanced outcomes for all mums, dads, children, grandparents and other family members. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, this bill does not seek to change the policy of the Family Law Act 1975 but, rather, to ensure that it works in the way that was envisaged—that is, quickly, rationally and cost-effectively. Nothing in the bill precludes a person from then exercising a legal right and going to court but, in most cases, there will simply be no need to do so. This bill proposes the adoption of methods which have been shown to work in other countries. I say to people: please have a look at this parliament, have a look at the bill and have a look at what my proposals are and come up with a really good reason to tell me why they won't work. Otherwise, let's implement this. Let's try and make change to help those people out there move on and get their issues settled so they can get on with their lives, and to give the children out there the opportunity to spend time with both their loving parents. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  At the outset, could I please place on the record my congratulations to Senator Hanson on her candour; in particular, with respect to her own personal circumstances in sharing with the Senate—and, through the Senate, with the Australian people—what her children have been going through. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my experience prior to coming to this place, acting as general counsel within a mining company, on many occasions I had people come into my office seeking advice with respect to how to deal with family law issues. Even though, obviously, I could not act for them in relation to their own personal family law issues, I always tried to give helpful suggestions and personal advice on how to navigate through those issues. I think Senator Hanson was absolutely correct when she said that our system should strive to try and achieve calmness, rationality, speed and lower costs in the system, because when the system goes wrong it can certainly have devastating consequences upon families, children and the wider community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking to the Family Law (Self-Assessment) Bill 2019, I'd like to state at the outset that the Morrison government is committed to keeping all Australians safe and secure, and that is why the government has taken action to improve Australia's family law system. It is good that, today, Senator Hanson, through introducing this bill, is increasing the debate in relation to this matter. The government is also committed to ongoing improvements to family law to ensure that it helps families separate in a safe, supportive and timely way. It should be noted at the outset, again, that the government appreciates that Senator Hanson's intent is to improve the operation of the family law system, which is an intention shared by the Morrison government. I was impressed with the exhaustive nature of the explanatory statement, which I did read, in relation to the bill. It's a substantial piece of work. While the government may not necessarily agree with the way many of the crossbench bills achieve their aims, they should be commended, as this one should be, for actually engaging in the process of drafting legislation to put forward their ideas with the limited resources at their disposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the bill in question, the government appreciates its aims to assist separating couples to self-solve their property and parenting disputes. However, it is the government's view that the dispute resolution models proposed are unlikely to achieve this outcome in some respects. While the bill intends to establish dispute resolution regimes that keep matters out of court, the prescriptive nature of some of the provisions contained in the bill are, in the government's view, unlikely to reflect and balance the vast complexities and differences between different families, or suit their needs or the needs of their children. When couples separate, the Family Law Act 1975 provides that the best interests of the child is the paramount consideration when resolving parenting matters. In determining what is in a child's best interests, of primary importance is the need to protect children from harm and, in the absence of factors such as violence or abuse, for the children to enjoy a meaningful relationship with each of their parents. I should note that that theme came through Senator Hanson's comments as well as being a major part of her motivation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Law Act is gender neutral and focusses on the rights of children and the responsibilities that each parent has towards their children, rather than on parental rights. It is not clear that all prescribed rules in the bill would be in the best interests of the child—from the government's perspective—for all families experiencing separation. Under the Family Law Act the court exercises a broad discretion in making an order, having regard to all relevant circumstances to make orders that are just and equitable, which is unlikely to be possible for all cases under the provisions in this bill. Given the level of prescription in the bill, however well-intentioned it may be, there is a risk more families may turn to the courts if they consider that the conditions set out in the bill are not suitable for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While intending to be compatible with the Family Law Act, there are some unresolved technical issues and gaps in the bill from the government's perspective. For example, the bill includes some terms that are undefined and makes presumptions that are not consistent with the current Family Law Act. This includes prescribing conditions for male spouses and female spouses, but there are also exceptions and carve-outs from the proposed self-assessment regime in a very wide range of circumstances. The bill would also make it an offence not to comply with high-level principles and, as such, would be difficult for police to enforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the government's commitments, whilst there are some issues with the drafting of the bill, we note the intent of Senator Hanson. The Morrison government is also committed to improving the family law system for Australian families. The Morrison government has already committed to structural reform of the federal family law courts to help end the unnecessary costs and delays for thousands of Australian families that arise from a split federal family court system. This will allow families to have their matters dealt with as efficiently as possible and under a single set of rules and procedures. These reforms will significantly improve the family law system. They will reduce the backlog of matters before the family law courts—which contribute to the delays Senator Hanson referred to—and, consistent with some of the intentions presented in the bill today, would drive timely, cheaper and more consistent resolution of disputes for Australian families. It is estimated that these structural reforms have the potential, in time, to allow thousands of additional cases to be resolved each and every year. They're not just cases; they're thousands of individual families looking to have their matters processed as quickly and efficiently as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also seek, again, to progress its clear and measured plan to bring together the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, to be known as the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia, the FCFC. The FCFC will become, in effect, a single point of entry into the family law jurisdiction of the Federal Court system and will create a consistent pathway for Australian families having their family law disputes dealt with in the Federal Courts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government also commissioned the first comprehensive review of the family law system in 40 years. Forty years is just too long. Forty years is simply too long, and it's a good thing the government has commissioned that review. That review, released in April this year, contained 60 recommendations for the family law system. The government is carefully considering the Australian Law Reform Commission's wide-ranging view of the system and is intent on ensuring the system works for Australian families, keeping them safe and allowing for efficient and timely separations, as is the intent of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to some other recent family law measures, the government's intention to commit to improving the family law system is clear from a range of significant measures this government has taken to assist and protect separating families. These include the establishment and now extension of specialist domestic violence units and health justice partnerships, costing $31.8 million over four years, which provide legal and social support and assistance to vulnerable women experiencing family violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Establishing and extending the Family Advocacy and Support Service to the tune of $22.6 million over three years provides duty lawyers at family law courts to provide services to families affected by family violence. In the 2019-20 budget, an additional $7.8 million was committed over three years for dedicated men's support workers to be engaged in all Family Advocacy and Support Service locations. The dedicated men's support workers will provide access to support services for both alleged perpetrators and male victims of family violence. Eleven million dollars has been allocated to improve information-sharing between the family law, family violence and child protection, including the co-location of state and territory family safety officials in family law courts. In addition, there've been introduced prohibitions against perpetrators of family violence from cross-examining their victims in family law proceedings, and the provision of $7 million to Legal Aid commissions to represent affected parties. Lastly, $10.7 million has been allocated over four years for the family law court system to employ up to 17 additional qualified social workers and psychologists as family consultants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to government measures aimed at helping to keep families out of court altogether, many of the government's family law supports are directed at helping those Australian families in this time of difficulty to resolve their disputes without needing to go to court and without needing to incur those legal expenses, which can be quite prohibitive. We note that, again, that is consistent with the purpose underlying this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the Women's Economic Security Package, the government provided $50 million over four years for family law property mediation. The government also provides mediation services that support families to reach agreement about their property splits between themselves, with a view to helping keep those families out of our court system. The measure is expected to provide an additional 31,200 couples across Australia with access to affordable property mediation each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also provide $10.3 million for Legal Aid commissions to run a two-year trial of lawyer-assisted mediation in each state and territory. The trial will support families with asset pools up to $500,000, excluding debt, to resolve their property disputes with the help of experienced legal aid lawyers. We need to do better through the system, with respect to those families with assets of $500,000 or less. It's ridiculous that so much of a mistake can be chewed up in terms of legal expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These recent measures are on top of the $160 million per year for family law services to support people with family law disputes outside of court. These services include counselling and education programs and were accessed by 70,000 men and 86,000 women last year. So those services, which are being provided, are being used.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, the government remains committed to working with the crossbench, including Senator Hanson, to improve the operation of the family law system in Australia. The government thanks the senator for the contribution and advancement of the debate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="SR5" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DODSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Family Law (Self-Assessment) Bill brought by the Pauline Hanson One Nation. Labor agrees that reforms to the family law system are needed. However, the reforms proposed in this bill are confusing, inconsistent with existing family law policy objectives—including acting in the best interests of children—and generally unworkable. Accordingly, Labor will be opposing this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes a range of measures to reform the family law system in relation to the resolution of financial disputes and parenting disputes, primarily through the use of an online self-assessment portal for the resolution of disputes. Our key concerns with the bill include the fact that the bill has been drafted without consideration of the extensive review of the family law system and recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission. I note that the final report of that comprehensive inquiry was tabled on 9 April this year yet the explanatory memorandum of this bill refers to the Australian Law Reform Commission being 'due to report on 31 March 2019', indicating that the bill and its explanatory memorandum were completed without any reference to that report and the many recommendations it has made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum makes numerous statements which suggest that this bill is being based on foundations at odds with the best interests of children in family law disputes. For example, the explanatory memorandum includes an assertion that its provisions will force a separating couple to 'act rationally', and a statement that this bill 'will serve utilitarian justice'—something the former Soviet Union justice system emphasised. An early draft of this bill was apparently provided to the Law Council of Australia. The Law Council raised a number of concerns, including constitutional concerns about the draft. These concerns are dismissed in the explanatory memorandum as being the result of arguments 'about the vibe of the Constitution', allegedly based on the Law Council's self-interest as a body representing Australian lawyers. The bill proposes differential treatment based on gender stereotypes, while the explanatory memorandum asserts that 'the Orwellian slogans about the best interests of children remain vacuous and provide no legal guidance, just more vitriol'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provisions in this bill in relation to the resolution of financial disputes contain a range of unworkable and draconian provisions, including, for example, a penalty of up to 100 penalty units—that's $21,000—for failing to provide an email address within 30 days under section 7. Under subsection 12A(1)—a provision titled 'Those who don't bother to try'—those who don't comply with obligations under the portal system established by this bill 'must pay a sum not less than the net equal equity value of the couple's family home to their spouse by the 90th day, together with a sum of $50,000.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provisions in relation to the resolution of parenting disputes also contain a range of unworkable or retrograde provisions. For example, the stated policy objective of these provisions in subsection 16(1) do not mention the best interests of the child. Another example is in subsection 17(2)(a) which provides that a residential parent must comply with 'their overarching obligation which is to enable shared parenting time in a prompt manner'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I say again that Labor acknowledges that there are significant problems with the current family law system which have led to unacceptable delays for vulnerable families and children. One matter raised in the explanatory memorandum to this bill that we in Labor agree with is that one of the reasons the family law system is not serving the interests of Australians is that the courts and legal aid are drastically underfunded. This underfunding is the result of ongoing neglect of Family Court and of legal assistance services over six years of the Liberal government. In fact, the family law courts around Australia are in crisis. Approximately 90 per cent of Federal Circuit Court work relates to family law. In all registries of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court families are experiencing longer and longer delays before their disputes are determined. At present, delays from court filing to the commencement of a trial can be as high as 36 months in both the Family Court and the Family Circuit Court of Australia. To some extent these delays have been further exacerbated by the mismanagement of court resources, with retired judges not always being replaced in a timely manner by this Liberal government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast to the Morrison government, Labor believes that for Australia to remain a fair and democratic nation justice must be accessible to all, rather than only those who can afford to hire lawyers. Ensuring that all Australians are able to have their legal rights upheld is especially important to families and children under threat of violence, to the victims of financial fraud and other crimes perpetrated against them by banks and other large companies, to Indigenous Australians, to communities, to the sick, the elderly and rural Australians, who don't have easy access to lawyers and to the courts, and to our new arrivals and those accused of serious crime. Providing access to justice for all Australians has been a Labor Party priority for over a generation, since the Whitlam government established legal aid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that time Labor has championed and strengthened the legal aid sector, which now includes three additional services in addition to the legal aid commissions. Firstly, over 120 community legal centres receive funding from the Commonwealth and provide vital legal services to Australians in need across areas including domestic violence, family advice, workplace abuse and minor criminal offences. Secondly, a network of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, ATSILS, provides legal advice, representation, community legal education and advocacy to Aboriginal Australians and communities. Thirdly, there are 14 family violence prevention legal services, which provide a range of services to Indigenous women and families, in particular to those suffering from domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When last in government, Labor actively supported the four legal services that make up the legal assistance sector. This included further vital funding boosts to community legal centres, the environmental defenders offices, the legal aid commissions and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service. In opposition, Labor has successfully fought against the vicious cuts to community legal centres that the Liberal government sought to impose in their last term, forcing the Liberals into a humiliating backdown and reversal of position. Labor will continue to champion improved legal assistance funding and continue to press for increased funding to our Family Court system, so that both can function as was intended when they were first established by the Whitlam government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, there is no doubt that things have to change in the Family Court system, both in terms of resourcing and the law itself. Labor's priority is making sure that changes to the family law system are done right. This bill does not do that. Reform of the family law system should be based on evidence and should be developed in consultation with input from the many stakeholder groups in the family law system. The proposed reforms in this confusing and poorly drafted bill clearly fail both of these tests. Labor will be opposing this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281697" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I rise to speak on the Family Law (Self-Assessment) Bill 2019. In rising to speak to this private senator's bill, I note that it is not my first speech. I acknowledge that Senator Hanson has been a longstanding advocate for reforming our family law system, and I congratulate her and One Nation for their diligent work in developing this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be noted from the outset that, while I agree with the intention of this bill to improve the operation of the family law system, which is an intention shared by the government, there are some technicalities with this bill which mean that we cannot support it as it is currently written. The Nationals in government, alongside the Liberal Party, are committed to keeping all Australians safe and secure, and that's why the coalition government have taken action to improve Australia's family law system and we continue to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recognises that ongoing improvements to our family law system are required to ensure families can separate in a safe, supportive and, most importantly, timely way. This is reflected in our decision to commission the first comprehensive review of Australia's family law system in 40 years to ensure that the family law system is contemporary, accessible and, importantly, fit for purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the bill in question, the government appreciates that it aims to assist separating couples to self-solve their property and parenting disputes. However, the dispute resolution models in this bill are unlikely to achieve this outcome. While the bill intends to establish dispute resolution regimes that keep matters out of court, the prescriptive nature of the provisions contained in the bill are unlikely to reflect the vast differences and complexities between families or suit the needs of their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When couples separate, the Family Law Act of 1975 provides that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration when resolving parenting matters. The Family Law Act, as it currently stands, is gender-neutral and focuses on the rights of children and the responsibilities that each parent has towards their children rather than parental rights. It's not clear that all the prescribed rules in this bill would be in the best interests of the child for all families experiencing separation. Under the Family Law Act, the court exercises a broad discretion, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, to make orders that are just and equitable, which is unlikely to be possible for all cases under the provisions of this bill. And, given the level of prescription in the bill, there is actually a risk that more families may end up in court if they consider that the conditions set out in this bill are not suitable for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there are some issues with the drafting and wording of this bill, the coalition government are committed to improving the family law system and working with the crossbench to do so. I would like to take this opportunity to speak to some of those. We've already committed to structural reform of the federal family law courts to help with the unnecessary costs and delays for thousands of Australian families that arise from a split federal and family court system. This will allow families to have their matters dealt with as efficiently as possible under one single set of rules and procedures. These reforms will significantly improve the family law system to reduce the backlog of matters before the Family Court and to drive, timely, cheaper and more consistent resolution of disputes for Australian families. It is estimated that these reforms have the potential, in time, to allow thousands of additional cases to be resolved each and every year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will again seek to progress its clear and measured plan to bring together the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, to be known as the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia, or the FCFC. The FCFC will become, in effect, a single point of entry into the family law jurisdiction of the Federal Court system and create a consistent pathway for Australian families in having their law disputes dealt with in the Federal Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As noted previously, the government have also commissioned the first comprehensive review of the family law system in 40 years, and we are carefully considering the 60 recommendations released by the Australian Law Reform Commission in April this year. We are intent on ensuring the system works for Australian families to keep them safe and allow for sufficient and timely separation. Our family law reforms are aimed squarely at helping Australian families resolve their disputes without needing to go to court, which is consistent with the intent and purpose of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Providing mediation services that support families to reach agreements about property splits between themselves will keep families out of court. As part of this, in the women's economic security package the government is providing $50 million over four years for the purposes of family law property mediation. This measure is expected to provide an additional 31,200 couples across Australia with access to affordable property mediation each year. We are also providing $10.3 million for Legal Aid commissions to run a two-year trial of lawyer-assisted mediation in each state and territory. The trial will support families with asset pools of up to $500,000, excluding debt, to resolve their property disputes with the help of experienced Legal Aid lawyers. These measures are on top of $160 million per year for family law services to support people with family law disputes outside the courts. These services include counselling and education programs, and have been accessed by 70,000 men and 86,000 women in the last year alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intent of this bill is to improve the operation of our family law system, and that intent is commendable. Our government is committed to keeping Australians safe in all areas of their lives, regardless of their circumstances, and that includes those separating through the family law system and those who have recently gone through family separation. Our family law reform agenda demonstrates our commitment to ensuring Australia's family law system remains accessible and works well for Australian families. We remain committed to working with the crossbench and all sides of parliament to improve the operation of our family law system, and we appreciate One Nation's efforts to achieve this goal.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="237920" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  It's a pleasure to rise to continue my address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech to the Senate. I was talking about the importance of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill 2019 at the time we paused our consideration of this matter last. Tackling union lawlessness and holding unions to account is vital to business confidence and profitability. Profit seems to be a dirty word, but, when businesses are profitable, employees are the ones who benefit. It allows for investment and expansion, and the creation of more jobs with the chance to move into new and more challenging roles and to be remunerated for that additional responsibility. And so profit should be, in fact, a virtue. It's quite funny that in the political sphere it isn't treated that way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about doing something important for the members of unions, recognising their needs and wants. For example, I think of the needs of teachers, of nurses and our many trades. These three sectors still have really high union membership numbers compared with unions in other sectors such food service, arts or recreation, mainly because of the importance of accessing insurance and representative services rather than necessarily to gain a political affiliation. And so often, I get reports that these groups don't trust the quality of the union representation that they're getting in the bargaining process, because, too often, unions have arranged kickbacks for themselves at members' expense, forgetting or selling out the needs of the workers they were established to work for. We need to be better at communicating the benefits to both the worker and the economy of getting these bills over the line. Ensuring there is integrity in our union sector is vital for the economic performance of this country, and that flows into the opportunities for the families of all Australians, and it flows into the pockets and the aspirations of households nationwide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might turn, then, to say a few things about this government's plan for the increasing number of jobs that we need to see in the economy throughout this country. We know that the best way to help Australians get ahead is to ensure that every Australian who can work is able to get a decent job, something that reflects their skill set and provides an opportunity to get ahead in the future. That's why we target our efforts at growing the economy—that's how we get more Australians into work, it's how we tighten the labour market, and it's how we increase incomes for all right across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office, 1.4 million jobs have been created by the private sector under the conditions that have been established by this government. More than 400,000 people who had never had a job have now been employed. This is a really significant achievement and one that this government is committed to continuing into this term. Not only does 400,000 people who'd never had a job getting a job mean that those people have more money in their pockets but it means the rest of the Australian taxpayers carry less of the burden of the social security support that's needed for those who can't or aren't working. It also gives each and every one of those individuals and the households that depend on them the dignity and hope that comes with being able to plan for a future, and they're setting an example to their families and children, which is so very important in making sure that we are building generations of diligent, capable and aspiring workers in this country. It's pretty exciting stuff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not to say there are no challenges to the economy in this country. Of course there are. There is low inflation. There is relatively low, by our long-term standards, wages growth—although it does exceed inflation and it exceeds the performance of most of the OECD—and that's something of concern to Australians and something that will require the continued diligence of this government. There are challenges posed by the trade war that is evolving internationally, and, in many ways, we don't have as much control over that as we do with what happens within our own shores. It's up to us as a government, and importantly here in this chamber, to do what we can to ensure that we are stimulating in every way possible jobs growth and to bear in mind that every individual should have the right to a job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers aged 45 and over, for instance, have so much to offer in the workforce. Last year, my Senate colleague Minister Cash announced a wonderful trial program: the Career Transition Assistance Scheme. This scheme is for people aged 45 and older and has been designed to help them get job-ready. We hear so often that people who have been engaged in a career for a long time can face challenges at this point in their life, and the need to retrain or reskill or shift their skill sets for this next phase of their lives is something that can be really difficult and confronting to people who face that situation. But it comes down to confidence. That word keeps permeating this address. Confidence in older workers is vital to them believing they can find a great job, and this scheme helps to identify the transferable skills they have and how those skills can be adopted to new industries or how they can be retrained slightly so they can apply their skills to a new trade. This scheme helps transition a person's already great contribution into the next phase of their life. It also helps to develop their confidence in the use of technology, including the ubiquitous smartphone, apps and social media technology, which are so familiar to young people and many of the people in this room, but which, at times, have been avoided by the older generations—and that's a difficult thing if you want to go for new job opportunities at that point in your life. This scheme is just one small way that this government is determined to do all it can to ensure the creation of 1.25 million jobs over the next five years, including 80,000 new apprenticeships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland, the current unemployment rate is six per cent. That compares to the national rate of 5.1 per cent. In her budget speech last month, Queensland Treasurer Ms Trad said that 199,000 jobs had been created in Queensland since 2015. But, as quickly as jobs were created in Queensland, the state government, through their mismanagement and lack of action, lost just as many. According to the Queensland Government Statistician's Office, 42,400 jobs were created in Queensland in the year from May 2018 to May 2019, but 33,000 were lost. They were mostly in the regions, and mostly in Mackay, in fact, which lost 11,300 jobs over the past 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all just numbers to Queenslanders in the regions, who have watched in horror as jobs have seeped out of their local economies because Labor will not allow major projects in their region to get off the ground. The six per cent unemployment rate across Queensland is—sadly and horrifically—nothing compared to the Queensland outback region where, in May, unemployment was recorded at 14.5 per cent and youth unemployment, shockingly, hit 24.1 per cent. But what would you expect when farmers are decimated by drought for years and then lose their remaining cattle to floods? Many have now faced fires in the last week or two. Vegetation management laws don't allow farmers to feed their starving cattle mulga without being slapped with fines in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and it's likely the transport subsidy for water, fodder and other necessities will be scrapped by the Palaszczuk government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no work out there in the regions and no policy help from the Queensland government to help farmers continue until the rain comes again. That means the efforts of this federal government across the board have never been more important than they are right now. Families across regional Queensland—and, indeed, right across urban and rural and regional Queensland—depend upon this government's economic performance in additional measure to the other states because the Queensland Labor government is just letting us down so badly back home on the environmental front, on the major projects front, and on the budget management and debt front. There is so much riding on there being jobs available for people throughout Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The futures, the aspirations and the very human potential of the people of our state cannot withstand year after year of incompetent Labor administration in Queensland. But Queenslanders should know that we are doing all we can to make up the difference, as we always do on the Liberal-National side.</span>

                  <a href="bv7" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINODINOS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  A typically erudite and feisty contribution from Senator Stoker, standing up for the people of Queensland! It's good to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this address-in-reply speech, I will address some of the items in the Governor-General's speech. What I found interesting was that it was a very wide-ranging speech. I was very impressed with the breadth of it. It was a reminder, and perhaps a rebuke, to those people who believe that the coalition is back in government with a limited agenda. In fact, the Governor-General laid out a very broad agenda. I particularly took to heart what he said towards the end:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And with those words it is my duty and my very great pleasure to declare the 46th Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia open.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, that was a reminder that this parliament and the democracy that underpins it is the pinnacle of the Australian achievement. It's here where the great national issues are fought out, debated, discussed and decided. Now, with the election over, our job as a government is to get on with serving the needs of the Australian people in the terms in which they gave us that remit at the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are back to pass laws that will improve the condition of our fellow Australians. That is the bottom line of what this government must be about—what any government must be about. The bedrock of that is the economy, and I quote from the Governor-General's speech where he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My government believes a strong economy is the foundation of the compact between Australians and their government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The foundation of the compact with the Australian people—the mutual obligation that exists—is that we expect our fellow Australians to work hard, play hard and live hard. But, in return, we expect our government to provide the conditions in which Australians can thrive and prosper. This is the mutual obligation at the heart of the compact between government and the Australian people. To me, there is nothing more important in that regard than what we do about our rate of productivity growth. Our productivity is not about working harder or working longer. It's about working smarter. It's about investing smarter. It's about all the ways in which we provide for new products and services, new ways of doing things and new processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going forward, it's important for us to have doubling the rate of productivity growth as our challenge so that we can maintain the growth in living standards we've become used to over the last few decades. Over the last few decades, income growth has been strong in this country. But for that income growth to continue, we need to double our rate of productivity growth, and that is the challenge that the Treasurer laid out in a recent speech where he talked about the importance of productivity. My colleagues in the Treasury and elsewhere, people like Ken Henry and others, often talk about the three Ps: productivity, population and participation. I believe strongly in population growth. I believe in a strong, well-managed immigration program as the bedrock of Australian development. That creates challenges, but we can meet those challenges. I think strong population growth is important for economic reasons, social reasons, cultural reasons and for our capacity to project our strength in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I strongly believe that participation is important. The greatest area of participation today where we can continue to make inroads is female participation in the workforce. While that has been rising, there are still challenges around that, and these challenges need to be addressed, whether it's in the way in which our tax and transfer system operates or the impact of effective marginal tax rates on people. It is often secondary income earners and women taking time out of the workforce to have a family who bear the burden of doing that and also contributing to government finances. It's important for us to promote measures that promote participation in the workforce. It also means, within the workforce, making the best use of all the talents available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People sometimes say, 'Why should we worry about diversity and inclusion?' Not only is diversity and inclusion a right in its own regard in how we treat our fellow human beings, it's also important in making the most efficient use of all the people we have in this country. I noticed the other day, for example, Gareth Evans talking about a bamboo ceiling when it comes to Asian Australians. We want to make sure that we make the best use of all our talents at all levels in Australia and that we break the ceilings, whether they are glass ceilings or bamboo ceilings. As the distinguished American economist Paul Krugman once noted, the bedrock is productivity growth. In the end, it's about productivity growth. So it's important, as I said before, to focus on how we can double the rate of productivity growth to maintain that growth in living standards as we go forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a long-term agenda. It's not going to happen overnight. The fruits of productivity growth do not appear overnight. The results can take years to come through, so there's no time to waste. We always have to be ready to do things. As my former employer John Howard used to say: 'With reform, the finishing line is ever receding. Just when you think, "I've done enough; I can rest on my laurels," there's always more to do if you're going to continue to raise incomes and living standards.' This is about not only incomes for people in work but also providing us with a capacity to support the living standards of people who are retired or of people who, for reasons of disability or whatever, cannot support themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Productivity growth is for everybody. Everybody has a stake in productivity growth, and for us in Australia there is plenty to do. We have many firms in Australia which are not as good as the top firm in their own sector when it comes to levels of productivity or productivity growth. Also, when we look at our best firms versus the best in the world, there's a gap in the productivity frontier that we can potentially meet. There are sectors where we are world leading when it comes to productivity and efficiency—there's no doubt about it. Agriculture and areas of mining come to mind. The important thing is that there's a gap there that we can exploit which gives us a capacity to raise our incomes going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, we have major commitments to jobs growth, public debt, smaller family businesses and exporters. For example, it's our aim to create 1.25 million new jobs over the next five years, including jobs for 250,000 young Australians. These jobs will build on the additional 1.4 million jobs created over the past 5½ years. We aim to pay down debt in a consistent and responsible way so that we can eliminate our net debt by 2030. Eliminating our net debt will make us stronger. It'll give us fuel in the tank. We had that fuel in the tank when we had the global financial crisis in 2008. Because we'd paid down our debt as a nation and we actually had net financial assets, we were better able to spend money to cushion the impact of the global financial crisis on this economy. You need that cushion. You need that budget cushion, those shock absorbers, so that when you're dealing with global slowdowns you have a capacity to shield the population. It's always the most vulnerable who are most impacted by economic slowdowns. Our job is to shield them, in particular, from the impact of those sorts of external shocks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our aims also include to have another 250,000 small and family businesses open their doors during the next five years and to see 10,000 more Australian companies exporting to the world by 2022, with these exporters benefitting from existing and new trade deals which, by the end of this term, will cover around 90 per cent of our trade. So, by the end of this term, we will have trade deals that cover 90 per cent of our trade. Just think about that: we have trade deals with China, with the Republic of Korea, with Japan. We have free-trade deals with the US. We've negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which covers 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific. We're negotiating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which covers many of those countries and China. We have these free-trade agreements that are flowing through, creating new opportunities for us or protecting our existing markets. It's very important for us to continue with those agreements. I commend Senator Birmingham for the job he's doing as minister for international trade and investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've already delivered on a major commitment that we made at the time of the election: the tax cuts. The tax cuts have been enacted. They are starting to flow through. As the Treasurer said, they haven't fully flowed through yet. We haven't seen the full impact of those tax cuts. A lot of that will come through in the September quarter and later. Those tax cuts are important. They're important in putting fuel in the tank where the economy is concerned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people are concerned that not all these tax cuts will immediately go into consumption, into spending on goods and services, directly into the economy. But, when people pay down their debt, when they pay down their mortgages, when they pay that to the bank and the bank gets that money back, that money then potentially circulates as new funding, new debt, in the economy—new mortgages in the economy, new lending in the economy. So even when people are paying down it potentially then still sees its way back in the economy. It's important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with the tax cuts, we've seen interest rates coming off, and the dollar has come off. We've got a major infrastructure investment program that's ramping up, something like $100 billion over the next few years. It's very important in terms of constructing new roads, new rail, new ports—everything that goes into creating the infrastructure for productive opportunity and activity. If you invest in the future through infrastructure, the payoffs are higher incomes and living standards in the future. It helps us with productivity growth. It's very important that that continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has also made a major commitment to cutting red tape. There's a lot of red tape everywhere. The reality is in this building, even when we're cutting back red tape, we're adding to it in all sorts of other ways, as many people will attest in the business sector and taxpayers more generally. So, for us, red tape reform is not just about the laws on the statute books. It's not just about the paperwork. It's also about regulations which impede our competitive forces in the economy—our mobility, our flexibility—things that stop us from being able to get things done and get them done quickly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been a lot of debate around environmental approvals, and there have certainly been efforts by this government from when we first came into power to streamline those approvals to create, if you like, more capacity to combine Commonwealth and state approvals so that people don't feel like they're just going through parallel processes, so they feel there is one seamless process. We need to continue that activity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to continue to fund strongly the ACCC and its work in promoting competition in the economy. I also commend the work that the Treasury portfolio are doing on data rights, on open banking so that you can shift your banking more easily between providers, and providers can use your data to come up with new products to meet your needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now we're seeing the rise of the fintechs, which are financial organisations that are using high technology, new technology to create new products and services in the financial space. This is a big game-changer in financial services; it's undermining the existing competitive structures. It's creating new structures, and that's a good thing, because, ultimately, that will create a more competitive landscape, which will be of benefit to bank consumers. We're also seeing the rise of what's called regtech, which is the use of technology to promote better regulation, more efficient regulation, and that's got to be a good thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need good regulation. When you do regulation properly—for example, when we regulate our agricultural goods and services properly, that's a big elephant stamp that they can use when they're marketing internationally, to say, 'These are Australian products, regulated to high standards, so you can have confidence if you consume these products because of Australia's reputation of being clean and green.' My point being that there is this technology disruption underway. We have to face into it. We have to embrace it. We have to adapt to change. If you don't adapt to change, it will walk all over you, it will roll over you. We don't want that. We want to adapt to change and empower people to deal with change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of that we embrace the development of new industries, whether it's in the energy space, where we're seeing the development of renewables, we're seeing a parliamentary inquiry into what will happen about nuclear energy. It's a reminder that Australia has the capacity to be the Saudi Arabia of alternative energy. We're seeing new industry development in space. We now have the Space Agency. I was the minister when we did the preparatory work for that. It was announced in September 2017 that we would have a space agency. That's now underway. That's going to facilitate our capacity to develop industry in that sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And there's a lot of commercialisation of Australian innovation and inventions to come. We need to keep promoting collaboration between industry, researchers and academia. That's one of the areas in which Australia still has more to do. We're great at inventing things. We're great inventors; we punch above our weight. We're great at doing blue-sky research, but we need to increase the linkages between that research and commercial outcomes—particularly outcomes that we develop and exploit here in Australia, because our aim should be to create homegrown firms that have their headquarters in Australia and make their decisions according to Australia's needs, and not be branch offices of overseas companies. It's very important for us to do that. We have world-beaters like Atlassian showing us how to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important for us to continue the government initiatives that are facilitating start-ups through venture capital and our procurement strategies, so we can increase the rate of business growth. The rate of business growth has been falling off since the global financial crisis. We need to take measures to keep creating more and more businesses and companies in Australia. That's why the government has made a commitment to numerical targets in that regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Complementing all of this is what we do around industrial relations. Here, the Prime Minister has made it clear that what we do in industrial relations will have to meet a number of tests. It will have to be mutually beneficial for employers and employees, it must not undermine existing conditions and it must provide broader benefits to the economy. It's very important to take people with us. It can't be reform for its own sake; it's got to be reform that addresses real issues. So business and others who want change in this area have to argue the public interest case, whether it's on unfair dismissal laws, greenfield agreements, the content of enterprise agreements or other changes that they need or that they see as important in promoting a more effective, resilient industrial relations system. Importantly, we have to have a system that can adapt to new ways of working, new collaborative workplaces with strong digital frameworks—that's the workplace of the future. How does our industrial relations system facilitate all of that? How does our industrial relations system facilitate the gig economy without throwing the baby out with the bathwater when it comes to worker protection?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Linked with all of this, of course, is skills acquisition and lifelong learning, because, as I said before, disruption is a constant; we have to adapt. That means that people may find during their working lives that they have various occupations. They need to be able to adapt; they need to be able to undertake the training or retraining needed for those new occupations. We have artificial intelligence, which is impacting on the composition of work. We have Industry 4.0, which is about how we wire up workplaces using technology. All of these things are creating challenges for our workforce going forward, so we need a flexible and responsive system that can respond quickly to changing circumstances and to many changes of job over a lifetime, which means the use of modular learning—so you don't have to go back to school every time you need to undertake skills training to do something different. There's also got to be a clear differentiation between general skills you may pick up in school, university or TAFE and specific skills you pick up in a workplace or by doing those specific modular courses I mentioned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend Australian companies like Faethm, which is a fast-growing company that helps companies and governments to assess the impact of emerging technologies on the jobs market, to reskill employees for the future, and to guide the implementation of appropriate investment strategies and policies to maximise the benefits of digital transformation. What Faethm do is essentially take an existing set of jobs and work out how those jobs will look in the future—what will be left, what will be new—and, therefore, what the workforce needs of the future are. These are tools that a lot of companies are picking up. They're used in parts of government. I encourage the government to pick up and use Faethm for workforce planning to get an economy-wide picture of how the workforce will change. Then we can talk to people about what the challenges are and how we can give them the tools through our skill packages and other things. We're investing major new resources into the skills space, setting up a national skills commission and a national careers institute. The budget contained a $585 million commitment to improve skills and training. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech—a speech that was devoid of a vision for this country. It embodied measures that are heartless, cruel and punitive and based on an ideological approach. Part of the speech, in the fifth or sixth paragraph, says: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our prosperity enables us to deliver one of the world's most reliable social safety nets, providing income support, universal health care, disabilities support, aged care—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is so far from what is actually happening it's not funny. We have a safety net in this country that has so many holes in it that people are falling right through it. We have a narrative that the Prime Minister is about compassionate conservatism. Well, it's not really in the dictionary, but what that means is 'heartless'. They don't care; they don't give a damn. In fact, it's how we can push as many people off income support as possible. If the Prime Minister is looking to the US, which is where that phrase started, that's exactly what they're doing, and that's exactly their aim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's ironic that the measures the government are proposing under their so-called 'world's most reliable social safety net' are devoid of evidence; they are ideological—but then the government fall back on the so-called data to support their positions, and they manipulate it at will and then don't provide it. For example, who saw the figures the government released on Friday on the targeted compliance framework? Those figures are not available on the website when you look for them. They're not there. I've been trying to get them. I've put questions on notice. They haven't been released. Then, all of a sudden, we got the government's version released to—who? Oh, yes, News Corp. Then you can't get them; you can't interrogate them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, if you look at some of the data on ParentsNext, which I got at the end of the last week through questions on notice, you'll see that nearly 80 per cent of those that have had their payments suspended are parents. It's called ParentsNext because it is about parents, most of whom are single parents, most of them single mothers. Eighty per cent of those suspensions are through no fault of the participants—80 per cent. You might say this, and I've heard the government say this: 'But they don't necessarily lose their payments.' Even the threat of losing payments—and I've heard this directly from mothers—curtails people's ability to spend. This is somebody's lived experience. They got told on Friday that they hadn't reported, but they had tried to. The phones were busy, and all those sorts of things happen. So, over the whole weekend, that mother basically could not spend any money because she did not know whether she was going to get paid on Monday, because she'd been told that her payment would be suspended. That is as good as cutting a payment when you're living from payment to payment, which is what parents do. That is not compassionate. That is not caring. That is not 'one of the world's most reliable safety nets'. If that mother did not know whether she was going to get paid on the Monday after that weekend, that is cruel; that is mean.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll come back to some of the other massive holes in our social safety net, but I wanted to go to First Nations people, who got a mention in the Governor-General's speech, and talk about issues that strongly affect our First Nations community. One is that the government is shouting loud and proud about constitutional recognition, which has been on the agenda for quite a long time, and support for elements of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. They don't talk so much about treaty and they don't talk so much about truth-telling, which are two key areas of the Statement from the Heart. They do talk about First Nations voice to parliament and about constitutional recognition. But, for those who have read and taken on board the Statement from the Heart, what that calls for is constitutional recognition via enshrinement of the voice in the Constitution. But the government, within weeks of being re-elected, have ruled out putting the voice in the Constitution. The very thing that the Statement from the Heart calls for, which has so much support in Australia, is that that should be enshrined in the Constitution. So we're going to a co-designed process. But the very thing that First Nations people are calling for is not included in that consultation process, so the government are undermining the very definition of a co-designed process. It is not what First Nations people are calling for. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government committed to the Closing the Gap targets in the Governor-General's speech. I understand that the process, finally, is on track, and there is a genuine co-design process, with the head of NACCHO and the minister now co-chairing that process. That should be replicated in everything that is done to our First Nations people. There needs to be genuine co-design, and government needs to genuinely embody the practice of ensuring that programs funded for First Nations people are developed, delivered and led by First Nations people. That includes delivery of services. That includes discussions on constitutional recognition. That includes issues around child care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was just at the SNAICC conference. The Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care does brilliant work around First Nations children in particular. The key issue that came up at that conference that got reported on the last day—I was only able to attend the last day, unfortunately—was the impact that the changes to child care have had on child care for First Nations people, to the point where First Nations providers are on the verge of having to close down. It has undermined the very thing that the Governor-General talks about in this speech in terms of making sure those services are there for First Nations people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also going to touch on things this speech doesn't mention, and one of those is the Aboriginal flag. Last week we had people in this place talking about the fact that the Aboriginal flag is under copyright and that First Nations sporting organisations are no longer able to use the flag on their uniforms without paying a massive amount of money. Apparently it's not called a copyright fee; it's 'admin services' and things like that. This government needs to show leadership and start negotiations to make sure that First Nations people can use that flag. In the nineties it was proclaimed as a flag; does that mean nothing in this country? That needs to be upheld by this government. People cannot be left in limbo, as is happening right now. I strongly support the Closing the Gap campaign. This issue needs to be dealt with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to another area that is not mentioned in the Governor-General's speech, and that is around justice, and, in particular, juvenile justice and the calls around the world to increase the age—Raise the Age, as the campaign is called—to 14 or above. That issue needs to be addressed urgently. The Northern Territory royal commission made hundreds of excellent recommendations, many of which involve the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth are not progressing this at the speed they need to. There needs to be action. For example, if you look at the recommendation around the provision of 'payment of Medicare benefits for medical services provided to children and young people in detention in the Northern Territory', the Commonwealth say they don't support that recommendation. That is something the Commonwealth has control over and needs to be addressing urgently, along with all the other recommendations, so that we see this issue around youth justice addressed. We need to be taking a diversionary approach to youth justice. Where's that commitment in here? In fact, where's the commitment and the heading around young people? It's not in here. Isn't that what this should be focused on?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where is the commitment to young people? Where is the commitment to properly address issues around climate change, for which we are bequeathing to young people all of the problems. I hope everybody in this place is attending the strike on Friday to show their support for the young people of Australia who are prepared to take up this issue. They're taking it into their own hands because they know it's their future and their environment that are at risk. They are not trusting this government, half of whom are in denial about climate change. It's not an issue of whether you believe in it. It's not a choice between believing in science and not believing in science; it's a thing. This government is in denial around taking action. Those are the issues that should be here. Those are the issues that the government should be looking at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They keep talking about, 'Oh, we've generated jobs.' That's a heading in here. Underemployment has increased, and it's young people who are feeling the effects of that, who are having to work two or three jobs and are trying to rely on our so-called 'reliable' safety net. The National Party, who are part of the government, now want to put young people—under the age of 35, I think it is—on the cashless debit card. They want to roll out the cashless debit card nationally. Again, it's devoid of evidence. Not only is there no evidence to support the cashless debit card; if you listen to the people that have been studying this and talk to people about it, it actually makes their lives worse. It makes it harder to budget, harder to go to the supermarket. It is demonising and stigmatising, and people talk about depression. That's what the National Party want to set on our young people. They want them to be demonised, stressed, depressed and angry at that approach. They're saying it's their fault that they can't find work; it's their fault that there's underemployment and they have to rely on our unreliable social safety net, which has people living in poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That takes me to the fact that the issue around Newstart was not mentioned in the speech—Newstart, which has not been raised for 25 years and keeps people living in poverty. In here we'll give tax cuts to the already well-off but we won't raise Newstart. One of the ways to boost the budget would be by raising Newstart. It would inject $4 billion into our economy and generate 12,000 jobs. That's not in this speech, because you wouldn't want a reliable social safety net! You want to demonise people! That is why the government rolls out the targeted compliance framework's so-called failures and the number of people who have been suspended or got demerit points, without, of course, actually providing the evidence for it: it's to demonise the people on income support. It is why the government has dragged out the drug trial issue again: 'Let's divert attention away from people, including older Australians, who need an increase in Newstart.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This document does talk about older Australians, but it doesn't seem to focus on the older Australians who are trying to survive on Newstart. We saw in the media on the weekend the lady whose CV had been wiped out. She's in her late 50s. She became unemployed, through absolutely no fault of her own. She is not getting adequate support from the jobactive system and is trying to survive on Newstart. What happens to her? To get onto Newstart in the first place you have to use up most of your savings, so you've got very little, or nothing, to fall back on. If you can't find work, by the time you get to the age of—what is it now?—66½, going up progressively to 67, you are wearing out your savings. Your assets are running down. You can't afford to replace your car, so you've probably got an older car, if you're lucky enough to have maintained it. You've used up all your savings. You are living in poverty. We know that living in poverty—living on Newstart—will most likely have impacted your mental health, because we know that people on Newstart are six times more likely to have health episodes and poorer health. We know they report 48.9 times more mental or behavioural issues. So we know that it is going to have an impact on older people's mental health yet we are prepared to see them continue to live in poverty on the very low Newstart and age in poverty into retirement. That's not a reliable social safety net. It's not a reliable social safety net to make your life harder by putting you on the cashless debit card or by drug testing you. Again we note that this is an evidence-free zone, that the approach to this is ideological. Every single drug expert that I have spoken to says the process won't work, yet here we have a government that's pursuing it regardless of the evidence. That's not reliable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we have a system that is trying to claw back money from those who are on income support, once again demonising those people and traumatising them. As I said, the Governor-General's speech talks about older Australians. It doesn't talk about those older Australians living in poverty, as I've just articulated. It doesn't talk adequately enough about how we are supporting people as they age into aged care and the system here that stinks, in many cases, to high heaven.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a government that's brought in some changes to the use of restraints in aged-care facilities, for example. It's one that we are seeking to disallow because it doesn't adequately address issues around chemical restraints. We have an aged-care system that is underfunded in this country and that does not supply the four hours, 18 minutes that research shows you need to provide adequate care to older Australians. We don't employ enough staff in our aged-care facilities, and then the government is surprised when they start having incidents in aged care that actually have now led to the royal commission. But the government can't wait until the royal commission reports to start acting on some of these grievous issues. These are issues that need urgent attention, and you would have thought that there would have been a much clearer vision in the Governor-General's speech for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Governor-General's speech talks about the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and anybody trying to access that scheme knows about the problems with that scheme. But I particularly want to focus on psychosocial issues because one of the issues that has been very poorly addressed in the NDIS is mental health. It's damning of the government who claims—and have moved to address mental health—that they can oversee a system that is so poorly addressing mental health and psychosocial disability. We have a massive problem in this country. If you're coming into the system with poor mental health and you haven't already got a package, you haven't managed to access NDIS or you haven't had previous support, where are the supports in this country? There is a massive gap here in the way that we are supporting people with poor mental health in this country if they are unable to access the NDIS. That's because the states and territories have put all of their funding into NDIS and there's now not enough funding for proper community mental health services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are heading for a train wreck here. It's not mentioned in the Governor-General's speech. There's no acknowledgement of these issues in that speech. This government is cruel to the most vulnerable members of our community. If you're doing okay in this country, you're okay. But, if you're not, you're falling through massive gaps in our social security system.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="N26" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  Eighteen May was a wake-up call to the Canberra bubble dwellers and the self-appointed elites, for on that day millions of Australians spoke quietly yet decisively through their ballot papers, rejecting big taxes, big government, the climate change emergency mantra and political correctness. Instead, they embraced lower taxes, smaller government, balanced environmental approaches and the virtues and values which have held us in good stead—in short: commonsense policies. The Prime Minister has since referred to these voters as 'the quiet Australians'. Before him, Sir Robert Menzies referred to them as 'the forgotten people'. They've been dubbed as 'Howard's battlers' and 'Tony's tradies', and now we have 'Prime Minister Morrison's quiet Australians'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact they voted to not only renew but also increase the government's mandate took many by surprise. Our fellow Australians rightly rejected the politics of envy, jealousy, division and class warfare which were oozing from Labor's policy platform—a platform that would have even embarrassed Gough Whitlam. The Australian people rejected the alternative Prime Minister, who threatened to run the country like a trade union. Instead, the quiet Australians voted for sound, sensible, stable policy positions, the first of which has already been delivered: namely, tax relief for all Australians to help with the genuine real-life issue of the cost of living. The quiet Australians rejected the extreme climate change mantra and the Labor-Green job-destroying, household-budget destroying, economy destroying and environmentally damaging Renewable Energy Target. Despite this election being variously dubbed in anticipation of a left-wing victory as the 'climate change election' and the 'climate emergency election' by Labor, the Greens, GetUp! and fellow travellers in elements of the media, the quiet Australians opted for the sensible, balanced approach of the Liberal-National coalition, based, as it was, on wise environmental and economic stewardship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are environmentally and economically astute. They listen to the arguments and ultimately ask the question: if Australia adopts the harsh Labor-Green prescription to reduce CO2 emissions, what will be the actual environmental gain for the economic pain? When our fellow Australians realised that the gain-to-pain ratio was zero environmental gain to massive economic pain, they sensibly adopted the coalition policy. When it becomes known that there are 400-plus coal-fired power stations being planned and built around the world, it becomes obvious that not even considering building an extra one in Australia to guarantee our own energy needs won't destroy the Great Barrier Reef, let alone the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an agnostic on this issue myself, I note the middle-of-the-road approach taken by Australians was, again, level-headed. Yet anyone questioning the extreme Green approach was immediately belittled and besmirched as deniers. Thankfully, the unseemly bullying and hectoring did not prevail. In that context, I can't help but reflect on the drawling vilification by the aforementioned self-appointed elites against those who established the Monash Forum. It may be recalled that the Monash Forum was established to ensure coal, as an energy source, was not foolishly demonised to the detriment of the wellbeing of our people. The forum and its members were belittled and besmirched in the absence of alternative robust arguments and evidence by a chorus of loud detractors who claimed coal mining would be a decisive issue at the ballot box. The detractors were right. Coal would play an important decisive role in the 2019 election campaign—a very important role. It just wasn't as they had predicted. In fact, it was the exact opposite. Support for the Adani coal mine was one of the decisive factors in the coalition's win. Its significance reverberated all the way to my home state of Tasmania, where the use of resources is a determinate for swinging voters, and swing they did. Labor's disingenuous attempt to walk both sides of the street was seen for what it was: fork-tongued politics trying to placate the extreme Greens while selling out hardworking Australians. Australians saw through that deception. They are not fools.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator ABETZ:</span>
                  </a>  I note, Senator McKim interjecting. Can I simply remind the honourable senator that it was Bob Brown, Leader of the Greens in 1983, who said he did not want renewable hydro energy because he favoured coal-fired energy? Fast forward 30 years—where is he now? Condemning coal-fired power and, by the way, wind power. The Australian people see through this foolishness. They see the cant. They see the hypocrisy. That is why the coalition was returned. Try as the Monash Forum might, no-one elevated the issue of coal mining more than Bob Brown and his petrol-burning, CO2-emitting, anti-Adani convoy. A convoy of southerners gate crashing Queensland to tell Queenslanders what they can't do wasn't exactly the wisest strategy. But, I hasten to add, most appreciated, lest I be seen as ungrateful. The arrogance, the southern superiority, the lack of empathy all helped to expose and publicise the true agenda of Labor and the Greens—an agenda to deny Australians jobs and hundreds of millions of Indians the opportunity to escape energy poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their desire to access our coal is because of its quality—high energy, low emissions. It's some of the very best in the world, which, in turn, would substitute the energy source of cow manure and forests. People can contemplate what might be best for the environment. And, when the facts don't suit, what do the left do? They simply belittle and besmirch. Those opposed to Bob Brown's convoy, namely the locals, or quiet Queenslanders, were labelled as Nazis and rednecks—always an endearing and winning tactic!—which, surprisingly, didn't win over the locals or, for that matter, other Australians. Indeed, labelling people as Nazis and rednecks might be considered by some as hate speech, but that's a topic for another day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the nastiness stakes were won by GetUp!. Their dishonest—blatantly dishonest—campaigns against leading coalition MPs backfired spectacularly with the excellent member for Boothby enduring all the ugly intimidation of sexism, genuine misogyny, threats and physical attacks on her office. Her electors were so repulsed she was rewarded with an increase in her vote. Well done, Ms Nicolle Flint, for meeting such cowardice and corruption with your determination and courage. Mr Josh Frydenberg, the Treasurer, had a dishonest campaign started against him, which GetUp! was shamed into withdrawing. Something similar happened in the electorate of Warringah. For GetUp! there are no boundaries. One of their operatives assaulted a Liberal campaign volunteer. But, when you're on the left and so self-righteous, the end always justifies the means. Thankfully, the public is now awake and has definitely repudiated GetUp! and its tactics. There were similar campaigns in Dickson against Mr Dutton, and, of course, he had a swing in his favour as well. So, it's a close call as to whether the Bob Brown Foundation or GetUp! wins first prize for assisting to raise the ire of the quiet Australians and spur them into determined political action and return the coalition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to misreading public sentiment, Rugby Australia's sacking of Israel Folau is up there for the bronze medal, Bob Brown having scored gold just over second placegetter GetUp!. Rugby Australia's ham-fisted, saturated-in-political-correctness attempt to justify the unjustifiable, hot on the heels of the sacking of Professor Ridd of James Cook University, also awakened many quiet Australians into action. For them, enough was enough. Why would you sack Australia's best rugby player because of a paraphrased Bible verse? Are we really to be told that the Bible is hate speech and quoting it is a hate crime? This awoke the sleeping giant of Australians' inherent decency. They didn't take to convoys. They didn't run dishonest campaigns or egg offices or intimidate. They did what decent people do—they let their strong views be known through the ballot box by putting their No. 1 vote next to their local Liberal and National candidates' name. Indeed, these quiet Australians raised over $2 million for the Folau fighting fund within 48 hours, with the average donation less than $100, highlighting the genuine grassroots nature of the campaign. No George Soros funding here. No CFMEU funding and no AWU funding like GetUp! gets—just 22,000 genuine Australians donating less than $100 each on average.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let there be no mistake: the Prime Minister did a fantastic job in the campaign, as did the federal director, Andrew Hirst, and our candidates and the thousands of supporters right around Australia. They were dedicated, they were focused and they knew what was at stake, so they campaigned right through to 6 pm on 18 May, taking nothing for granted. And they were richly rewarded for their efforts, with the confidence of the Australian people being placed with the coalition. But I cannot help but think that but for Bob Brown, GetUp! and Rugby Australia my colleagues and I may well have been be sitting on the other side of the chamber, in opposition. Given their sterling contribution to the coalition victory, it is only right and proper to thank Bob Brown, GetUp! and Rugby Australia; to fail to thank them may be interpreted as being somewhat ungrateful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More seriously, I encourage our media and other commentators to reconsider their commentary and reflect: why were they so out of touch with the sentiment of our fellow Australians? Could it be they only wanted to listen to a loud, noisy, unrepresentative group which echoed their own shrill judgements? Those who took very tough decisions with an eye to the Australian people were vilified as wrecking the party, being out of touch, dinosaurs and worse, yet here we are today with an election result which has seen the self-appointed experts pulping their pre-prepared books, changing the titles of their books and rewriting slabs of others, yet not a word of recognition of how wrong they were in belittling and besmirching those who actually helped engineer the foundations of this win for the Australian people—but they never have and, I suspect, they never will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember the scorn applied to the Liberal Party when it elected John Howard to the leadership. 'Back to the future'—they said—'snigger, snigger'. I recall similar scorn when we elected Tony Abbott to the leadership. 'Unelectable'—was their assessment—'snigger, snigger'. I recall similar scorn when we rejected the emissions trading scheme and the carbon tax. 'How out of touch can you get?' was their call—and, again, the snigger, snigger. It has, it seems, ever been thus and is unlikely to change soon. So my thanks goes out to those who stuck with the Liberal Party in the tough times, who helped campaign against all the odds in exposing the folly of Labor, the Greens, GetUp! and the politically correct and who helped empower the forgotten people, the Howard battlers, the Tony tradies and the quiet Australians to achieve a victory for common decency and those virtues and values that continue to make Australia the envy of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in the greatest nation on earth, and the Australian people are well and truly onto this. They rejected the constant negative portrayal by the Left of their country, their culture and their values—the negativity in relation to, for example, our excellent refugee policy. The intake of refugees, in numerical terms per head of population, is right up there with the best in the world. What is more, the services we provide to those refugees are second to none in the world. And what do we do with our refugee policy? We seek to ensure that we help those most in need. Yet those of the Left somehow tell us that if you've got a stack of money you can pay criminal people smugglers and never bother setting foot in a refugee camp. They tell us you should be prioritised over those people that I personally visited in western Thailand living in a refugee camp with no sanitation, no air conditioning and no medical services supplied, as we'd provide. These people have been there not only for five years; you can multiply that by three or four—15 to 20 years—not knowing what their future holds and not knowing when they might be given placement in another country. When you've got to make the judgement call: to whom should we give priority? I would prefer to give priority to those people each and every day rather than those who have sought to game the system with their money and their employment of criminals to advance their cause. And the Australian people are awake to these sorts of factors despite the ongoing mantra from the Left, which seems to want to condemn everything that Australia does so exceptionally well. If you go around the world, people will ask why is it that Australia is able to protect its borders and have such a good policy in relation to refugees. It's because of strength, having a moral compass and knowing that supporting those most in need will always be the most appropriate way to move on such issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, there is the Greens' condemnation in the previous speech on drug testing for welfare recipients. This is not about demonising. The best thing you can do for those people who might be afflicted with drugs and unemployment is to say, 'We want to help you, and if you've got an issue, we will seek to help you out of that life, because it's not good for you, not good for your family, not good for society and not good for the economy.' Everybody knows that drugs are often the cause for people not being able to gain employment or maintain their employment. We also know, in relation to employment, that your self-esteem, your mental health, your physical health and your social interactions are all enhanced if you are given the benefit of gainful employment. So why wouldn't we, as a caring, compassionate society, say to people, 'We will seek to assist you, to lift you out of the position you're in, so you can become self-reliant and get the benefits that so many other Australians enjoy'?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our task as the government is to lead and serve as custodians of the trust placed in us and to proactively deliver for the quiet Australians who want their government to focus on jobs, cost of living, national security, community safety and family, and to resist the folly of the divisive and corrosive political correctness agenda of those that inhabit the Canberra bubble, preaching their agenda of jealousy, envy, identity politics and climate emergencies. Knowing my colleagues as I do, I see us committing ourselves and dedicating ourselves to the continued service of the people of Australia to the very best of our ability during the life of this, the 46th Parliament.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264449" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  It is a privilege to respond to the Governor-General's address and to the extensive agenda of the Morrison coalition government. As the Governor-General referenced in his address, at the 2019 election more than 15 million Australians had their say about what they want from their government and their parliament over the next three years. Hardworking Australians made a simple and humble demand that their aspirations for their future be respected and supported by those they elected. That's why hardworking Australians voted for a government that understands them and understands that they are focused on raising their families, running their businesses, working hard, volunteering and caring for their family and friends. That's exactly what the Morrison government promised, and that is exactly what the Morrison government is delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are firmly committed to a platform to keep the economy strong and to pursue policies that ensure Australians keep more of the money they work so hard to earn, and to give them more freedom and opportunity to make their own choices about their priorities in life. We saw this come to fruition in the very first week of the 46th Parliament. Tax relief for more than 10 million working Australians was delivered. Around $1,000 of their own money has gone straight back into the pockets of these hardworking Australians as they complete this last financial year's tax return. Doing this, putting this commitment into legislation as the first order of business of the 46th Parliament, clearly demonstrates that, as a government, we meant exactly what we said during the election campaign, that Australians who work hard should be rewarded by their government through the lowest possible taxes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, we have a Labor opposition that took to the election a high-taxing, high-spending agenda which was resoundingly rejected by the Australian people. Surprisingly, when it came time to debate our tax relief legislation, they still hadn't learnt their lesson and tried their best to prevent the full tax relief plan from passing the parliament. As we stand here today we are still no clearer on whether Labor will retain that high-taxing agenda, as many in their ranks want to do, or listen to the election outcome and the people of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vitally important that the government continues to have a sound fiscal policy that supports a strong economy. That starts with fostering a healthy budget bottom line. I believe the Treasurer has done a magnificent job to put the budget back in the black while also delivering sensible and affordable tax relief to Australians. This responsible fiscal management will support our economy to continue to grow and prosper over the coming decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own state of Tasmania, the Morrison government is delivering a total investment in infrastructure of over $2.7 billion, including an additional $313 million in transport infrastructure to bust congestion, improve safety and unlock greater productivity through our businesses and exporters. A more efficient transport network equates to lower costs for Tasmanian businesses in getting their product to market, which means more opportunities for businesses to grow and to employ more people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that job creation is firmly at the centre of the Morrison government's agenda. I welcome the investment by the government in supporting Tasmania's growth industries. As I outlined in my first speech in this place, ensuring there are more opportunities in our state for young Tasmanians, particularly employment opportunities, is front of mind for me as a new senator. That's why I'm so pleased that this government is investing heavily across a range of industries in Tasmania, where there are proven opportunities for growth and job creation. For example, we're investing $100 million for the next tranche of irrigation schemes across our state. That will lead to great new opportunities and enhanced water security for Tasmanian farmers. The benefits of previous investments in irrigation schemes around Tasmania by the federal coalition government and the state Liberal government are very clear. This future investment is eminently sensible and timely in its commitment to ensuring our state can continue to increase our exports of premium agricultural products to the nation and the world. It's not always well understood on mainland Australia that Tasmania is susceptible to drought. Indeed, many of the farmers on the east coast and south-east have done it very tough in recent years because of extremely dry conditions. That's why it has been great to see this government establish the Future Drought Fund, with $100 million available each year to invest in drought preparedness and recovery programs. The fund is a very welcome initiative for rural communities all over Australia. We know how tough it is in so many parts of the country at the moment, and we must as a nation do everything we can to support our farmers, because we know that this won't be our last drought experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further evidence of our government's jobs creation agenda can be seen through our support of the Marinus Link second interconnector as part of Tasmania's Battery of the Nation pumped hydro plans. This exciting new project is very welcome, particularly in the north and north-west of our state, where these projects will create thousands of jobs directly and indirectly. Furthermore, Battery of the Nation and its associated infrastructure will play an integral role in ensuring Australians have access to reliable and renewable energy into the future. We are also supporting the Tasmanian Defence Innovation and Design Precinct at the Australian Maritime College and the blue economy research centre, and investing in tourist infrastructure upgrades at Freycinet National Park and Cradle Mountain. In the south of the state, the government is cementing Tasmania as Australia's Antarctic gateway with $2.8 billion of investment. These policies are just some of a long list of job-creating and supporting investments by this government in Tasmania and across the whole country. They are a stark contrast to the platform that Labor put forward at the election and continue desperately to cling to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Governor-General's address noted, when you have a strong economy and good budget management you can invest more in the services that Australians need. Indeed, the Morrison government is investing an extra $31 billion in public hospitals over the next five years, providing funding for more emergency department visits, outpatient services, needed scans and surgeries, and treatments of life-threatening illnesses and diseases. We're investing $308 million into reducing the cost of life-changing medicines for Australians, especially those who have chronic conditions that require multiple medications. We're putting almost $740 million into youth mental health and suicide prevention strategies. This is an incredibly important initiative, particularly for regional and rural Australia, where suicide is such a big issue and something that we as a community must do more to address. There is always more to do in the health space, and I know that this government will continue to work with the states to ensure Australians have access to the best possible health services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my maiden speech I referenced the importance of education and training to Tasmania, and I'm very pleased with the commitment the government has made to boost educational outcomes and, in particular, skills training to ensure that our young people are job ready. Over the next decade, the government will increase funding for all primary and secondary schools across all sectors by an average of 62 per cent per student. This $310 billion investment is a commitment to deliver the world-class education system that will equip Australia for the decades ahead. We also have $585 million invested in a commitment to training to improve skills, including creating 80,000 new apprenticeships and establishing 10 new industry training hubs in key locations of high youth unemployment in regional Australia. Burnie, in north-west Australia, was one of 10 locations of elevated youth unemployment across Australia that has been selected to host an industry training hub, which will strengthen partnerships between local schools, employers and industries, and ensure that vocational education programs are tailored to meet the local workforce needs and skills demands. I certainly applaud this important initiative being rolled out in my own home state. Under this education program, young people aged between 15 and 24 in training hub areas will be able to apply for a scholarship to undertake an eligible VET approved program of study. Across the nation, 400 scholarships valued at up to $17,500 each will be made available, from certificate III to advanced diploma level. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these investments which I've outlined here today are made possible by strong economic management and having the budget back on track. I'd like to conclude by strongly supporting the sentiments at the conclusion of the Governor-General's address, in which he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Democracy is a robust undertaking, and disagreement is a fundamental part of that contest of ideas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has often noted, the challenge of modern democracies is not to disagree less but to disagree better. I cannot agree more with these sentiments. We will always have our disagreements and our debates in this place, whether it's here between elected members or in the community between citizens. But in an age where disagreements often seem to be becoming more heated, and arguments more vitriolic and even abusive, it is more important than ever to remember that in our great country, in Australia, we all have a right to voice our opinion and every other person in our country has the right to respond in a responsible and dignified manner. This debate should only be encouraged because it is by this contest of ideas that, I believe, good policy outcomes are reached. To that end, freedom of speech is certainly an essential part of what makes our country so great, and we in this place and across this country must never lose sight of that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (12<span class="HPS-Time">:08</span>):  It is with great honour that I rise to speak in reply to the Governor-General's address. I think at the outset we should reflect, as the Governor-General did, on this country's very strong foundations. We're in our 28th year of consecutive economic growth. We have a strong social security safety net; universal health care; a strong, comprehensive education system; and, on 18 May earlier this year, all Australians came together peacefully at the ballot box and cast their votes in a democratic election. We are one of the longest ever continuous democracies on the face of the planet, so we should reflect on those strengths in our society as we consider the address.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the themes coming through the Governor-General's address is the cohesive plan that this government has for this country's future over the next three years. The government's agenda is predicated on empowering the people of this country, empowering their aspirations, empowering their inherent entrepreneurial spirit and empowering them to make decisions which are in their best interests and the best interests of their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make some responses to some of the previous speakers. Senator Siewert did refer to the government's initiative with respect to the cashless welfare debit card. There is no question that the senator comes to this debate with great passion and great empathy for people who are doing it tough in our society, but I must respectfully say that I disagree with some of the assertions that were made in that speech. As I've referred to in previous debates on this subject—in particular, last week—the member for Hinkler, Mr Keith Pitt, has drawn attention to the fact that he has seen a very positive response to the implementation of the cashless welfare debit card in his seat of Hinkler. Over the course of the last 12 months, we have seen the rate of youth unemployment in the seat of Hinkler, in the wider area of Wide Bay, fall from 27.6 per cent in June 2018 to 18.4 per cent in June 2019—a fall of 9.2 per cent. It is quite an astounding result. When you look at the comparative increases in youth unemployment across Queensland, you see that Wide Bay is a stand-out. So there is some positive evidence with respect to the results of the introduction of the cashless welfare debit card. I would have thought that everyone in this place would simply want to see those young people who currently don't have the opportunity to engage in work and have the benefit of the dignity of work get a chance to break through to the workforce and be everything they possibly can be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to make some comments with respect to Senator Abetz's contribution in this place. I could not agree more that the coalmining industry is an industry integral to my home state of Queensland. At the last federal election, Queenslanders sent an unequivocal message to this place that they understand the importance of that industry to my home state of Queensland. There are thousands of jobs, billions of dollars in royalties and opportunities for small and large businesses across my state presented by the coalmining industry and, more generally, by the resources industry in my home state of Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to touch on the issue of mental health, in particular, in my response in this debate on the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech. It would be 25 or 26 years ago that, as a member of the Queensland Young Liberals, I wrote a policy paper, which was adopted at a Young Liberals national convention, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">230,000 lost years: the scourge of youth suicide</span>. Here we are, 25 or 26 years later, still grappling with this extraordinarily difficult issue. It does give me a lot of hope that everyone sitting in this Senate chamber, those on all sides, understand the importance of us, as a federal parliament, addressing this issue. For me, one of the highlights of the federal election campaign was when, in one of the debates between the leaders, the Prime Minister and the opposition leader were asked: 'Can you tell us one thing about the other which you actually admire? How would you compliment the other leader, your opponent, with respect to how they've conducted themselves with respect to their beliefs?' And the then opposition leader complimented the Prime Minister with respect to his passion in addressing the issue of youth suicide. So there certainly is a spirit of bipartisanship, a spirit that extends across all parties, with respect to attempting to address the issue of youth suicide, which is addressed in the Governor-General's speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the five-year period from 2013 to 2017 the average number of suicide deaths per year in this country was 2,918. Queensland recorded the largest increase in suicide deaths: 804 in 2017 compared with 674 in 2016. The figures from 2017 with respect to youth suicide make for sobering reading indeed. In 2017, there were 16 suicides between the ages of zero and 14, 106 between the ages of 15 and 19, and 195 between the ages of 20 and 24. There were a total of 2,348 male suicides. In relation to female youth, in 2017 there were eight suicides between the ages of zero and 14—it is hard to comprehend that—there were 50 between the ages of 15 and 19, and there were 53 between the ages of 20 and 24.  There were a total of 780 female suicides. In 2017, the total number of suicides in this country was 3,128. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just an issue of the young people who took their own lives; it's also an issue of those people who are left behind—parents who are left grieving and considering whether or not they are guilty in some way with respect to what has happened to their children, and friends asking themselves whether they could have taken additional steps to look after their loved ones to try and prevent the tragedy that occurred. So it's extraordinarily important that we have this discussion about suicide generally and youth suicide in particular. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also been noted that there is a particular issue with respect to the rates of suicide in our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In 2017 the rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander suicide was twice that for non-Indigenous people. Suicide accounts for 40 per cent of all deaths of Indigenous children. One life lost to suicide is one too many. Last week, the government announced it is investing $4.5 million in the proud spirit Australia program to deliver a national plan for culturally appropriate care and make suicide prevention services available and accessible to First Australians, no matter where they live. In addition, the government is investing $963,000 to establish the Centre of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Lived Experience Mental Illness and Suicide Network. The Black Dog Institute and the Centre of Best Practice in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Suicide Prevention at the University of Western Australia will work together to deliver this initiative. But it's not just about government; I think it's about each and every one of us reflecting upon what we can do as individuals to address the scourge of youth suicide. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">William Styron is a well-known author who famously wrote the book <span style="font-style:italic;">Sophie's Choice</span>.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>After someone who he admired a great deal committed suicide, he went public, in a beautifully written memoir called <span style="font-style:italic;">Darkness Visible</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: A Memoir of Madness</span>, where he spoke about his own experiences dealing with depression. I want to read some excerpts from that book today:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the pain of severe depression is quite unimaginable to those who have not suffered it, and it kills in many instances because its anguish can no longer be borne. The prevention of many suicides will continue to be hindered until there is a general awareness of the nature of this pain. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's incumbent on each and every one of us to reflect on that, to try and understand, when we have colleagues, friends and family who are battling with depression, the pain they're going through and provide as much support to them as possible. We are still battling a stigma in our society. Talking about his own experience with depression, Styron wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So the decision-making of daily life involves not, as in normal affairs, shifting from one annoying situation to another less annoying—or from discomfort to relative comfort, or from boredom to activity—but moving from pain to pain. One does not abandon, even briefly, one’s bed of nails, but is attached to it wherever one goes. And this results in a striking experience—one which I have called, borrowing military terminology, the situation of the walking wounded. For in virtually any other serious sickness, a patient who felt similar devastation would by lying flat in bed, possibly sedated and hooked up to the tubes and wires of life-support systems, but at the very least in a posture of repose and in an isolated setting. His invalidism would be necessary, unquestioned and honorably attained. However, the sufferer from depression has no such option and therefore finds himself, like a walking casualty of war, thrust into the most intolerable social and family situations. There he must, despite the anguish devouring his brain, present a face approximating the one that is associated with ordinary events and companionship. He must try to utter small talk, and be responsive to questions, and knowingly nod and frown and, God help him, even smile. But it is a fierce trial attempting to speak a few simple words. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's William Styron recounting his battle with depression, which he bravely wrote about in <span style="font-style:italic;">Darkness Visible:</span><span style="font-style:italic;">A Memoir of Madness</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we all consider those words and consider what empathy and understanding we can give to people who are suffering from depression. It's also important that, once people have gone through that journey and are on the road to recovery, once they've overcome that stigma of whether or not they should report their illness to a doctor and once they've gotten that help, we assist them to come back into the general workings of our society, our workplaces, social engagements et cetera and understand that they may well need ongoing treatment in order to minimise the risk that they might add to those suicide statistics that I read out earlier today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this regard I would like to quote Andrew Solomon, who wrote a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Noonday Demon</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: An Atlas of Depression</span>—again, a depression sufferer who went public to try and increase understanding of what it is like to suffer from depression. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Since I am writing a book about depression, I am often asked in social situations to describe my own experiences, and I usually end by saying that I am on medication. 'Still?' people ask. 'But you seem fine!' To which I invariably reply that I seem fine because I am fine, and that I am fine in part because of medication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">'So how long do you expect to go on taking this stuff?' people ask. When I say that I will be on medication indefinitely, people who have dealt calmly and sympathetically with the news of suicide attempts, catatonia, missed years of work, significant loss of body weight, and so on stare at me with alarm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">'But it's really bad to be on medicine that way,' they say. 'Surely now you are strong enough to be able to phase out some of these drugs!' If you say to them that this is like phasing the carburettor out of your car or the buttresses out of Notre Dame, they laugh. 'So maybe you'll stay on a really low maintenance dose?' they ask. You explain that the level of medication you take was chosen because it normalizes the systems that can go haywire, and that a low dose of medication would be like removing half of your carburettor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You add that you have experienced almost no side effects from the medication you are taking, and that there is no evidence of negative effects of long-term medication. You say that you really don't want to get sick again. But wellness is still, in this area, associated not with achieving control of your problem, but with discontinuation of medication. 'Well, I sure hope you get off it sometime soon,' they say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there is a lesson there that there needs to be an understanding that, where people who have, potentially, dealt with suicide attempts have gotten help and are on the road to recovery, that road to recovery may require treatment over a long period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm proud to be part of a government which is building a mental health system that is integrated, simplified, trusted and comprehensive and which is increasing mental health funding to $4.8 billion this year to provide new funding for community mental health and mental health research, assistance to prevent suicide, telehealth access for psychological services in regional areas and support for current and former ADF personnel, as well as funding an additional 30 headspace services by 2020, including in my home state of Queensland, and new specialist residential facilities for eating disorders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's $503.1 million Youth Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan is the largest suicide prevention strategy in Australia's history. It's one we should all be proud of as we seek to introduce measures to address the scourge of youth suicide and suicide more generally. And it is part of an overall plan which is dealt with in the Governor-General's address to this place, including with respect to the economy, trade, education, health, environment and the Pacific step-up plan, which I referred to in my first speech last week. It is all part of a coherent, integrated plan which I consider to be in the best interests of my home state of Queensland. In performing my duties over the course of the next six years, I take very seriously my obligation to deliver that plan for the people of Queensland, because that is what they voted for on 18 May earlier this year.</span>

                  <a href="273828" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  I rise today to respond to the Governor-General's address and acknowledge the government's focus on improving and delivering the NDIS. As I said in my maiden speech a few weeks ago, the NDIS is for all of us. The NDIS may not be applicable to some people now. They may not need it. They may not require it. Their family may not need to utilise the supports and services available. But that's not to say at some stage in the future, be it by birth or by accident, that families may need to access the NDIS. Therefore, it is important for all of us, here in this place and in this parliament as well as for the Australian people, to deliver an NDIS that is fit-for-purpose and that focuses with the best intentions to support all Australians should they require it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to pay tribute to the Prime Minister and the government with regards to the focus and attention that they are putting on those with autism and their families. I'd like to acknowledge a lot of the work that is already underway in this area. With the attention and acceptance that's been given, and their willingness to take advice and listen to those who have a lived experience of the condition itself or to a parent and carer, we are working towards significantly improving the conditions for autistic people and their families. I look forward to that improving as we move forward, day by day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share today some of the feedback that I have been receiving, not only since coming to this place but also previously, from families and from autistic people about things that we can improve upon to help autistic people and their families. One of the things that is consistently raised with me from parents is that guidelines on therapy options at diagnosis are still unavailable and are still ad hoc, depending on who you see at the time of diagnosis. Whilst autism has a high profile—and I'd like to think sometimes I may have had something to do with that—and we talk about it a great deal and there are lots of people who advocate very strongly for it, unfortunately, a lot of these invisible and developmental disabilities are still often poorly resourced at the diagnostic stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Improved access to guidelines around therapy options should be made available and worked towards, with directions provided more clearly to parents at a time that is of considerable grief. At the time of diagnosis—being a parent myself—it would be wonderful to hear that things will get better and that this is not the end of the world. It is difficult for a lot parents to come to terms with the diagnosis at that time because their ideal of what their child and what their child's future was going to look like all of a sudden looks very different. So, during that time of confusion and grief, it would be helpful for parents to receive a lot more guidance about the therapy options and choices that they need to make. There are resources available, and I'd like to acknowledge the government's website Raising Children. There are very good resources. Unfortunately, though, parents are not often made aware of them at the time of diagnosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to see, and a lot of parents and those who've worked in the space for a considerable amount of time would like to see, the focus come back to capacity building rather than being therapy based—looking at how we work with children and focus on their strengths rather than their deficiencies, how we can improve their lives and increase their daily living capabilities and how we can increase the functionality within the parents and families themselves to make sure that children are developing and improving and gaining further independence as quickly as possible and in the best and most productive way as possible with access to services. As we talk about the NDIS, obviously the under-seven cohort is considerable with early childhood, but autism is also playing a really large part when it comes to the numbers of NDIS participants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the positive steps forward that I'm looking forward to are seeing disability-specific planners so that people will be able to see a planner who actually has a previous knowledge of that disability, of that condition, so that a parent is only having to advocate for their child and not having to educate the planner on what the disability means and what the therapy options are that are required. One of the most disturbing things I have had reported to me through my office on a number of occasions was that planners have asked when children grow out of autism. I can assure you, from the very definition of autism being a lifelong disability, that doesn't occur. With the right supports and with the right interventions, children will move up and down the autism spectrum as they go through their lives. We should be encouraging that and making sure that that happens as successfully as possible. We certainly should not be looking to the option that they will grow out of autism, because that doesn't happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that would be a step forward and that a lot of parents would be looking forward to is more access to in-clinic programs, more programs that are run within a centre-like environment, as opposed to the in-home programs that are fundamentally being looked at and funded at the moment. Rather than consortium programs of speech therapy, OT, early intervention and psychology being administered at home, a lot of families would be much better serviced, taxpayers' dollars would be better spent and children would benefit much more from having access to therapy options in a preschool- or kindergarten-type setting. All this can be demonstrated through stronger database reporting, particularly with the younger cohort. Any best practice behavioural program will consist of taking data. That data should be made available and our reporting should be much better. When the NDIS is such a significant investment by the taxpayer and our community, we should be making sure that what we're investing in is actually working and making sure that the children are getting access to the therapy that is making the biggest difference to their lives. That will occur, and I think we'll start to see more market based led interventions as parents start to understand the choice and control side of the NDIS a lot better and also as the market players start to respond much more to a market environment as opposed to the former block-funding model.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must admit there is one part of block funding that I do miss. One of the unintended consequences of the NDIS—and I have certainly welcomed the Prime Minister's interest in this area—is around siblings and families and carers. Because the NDIS and the plans associated with participants are very much person centred, the idea of respite has been knocked back. I can tell you that, as a parent, I need respite from both my child with a disability and my children without a disability. It's just easier to organise for the children without a disability. We shouldn't be looking at respite as a dirty word, and we should be starting to build that into the plan and functionality of the NDIS so that we are supporting the siblings and parents and carers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd just like to acknowledge Senator Scarr and the comments he made with regard to mental health, depression, and the use of medication. One of the hidden consequences of disability, particularly for parents and carers with young children, is that, as they go through the process of diagnosis and development of therapy programs and beyond, there can be a dip in mental health and extreme stress both in an intellectual capacity and an emotional capacity. A lot of relationship breakdowns occur throughout these processes and times, and depression is quite common within the carer cohort. So the acknowledgement of the use of medication and the importance of therapy and those sorts of things should be much more of a focus. They should be looked upon much more favourably and acknowledged throughout the process of children being diagnosed with autism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I would like to also acknowledge Kate Strohm and Siblings Australia, who do great work talking to families and siblings about how they can best deal with having a brother or sister with a disability. Children who have a brother or sister with a disability quite often miss out. They can suffer from their own forms of depression and other mental health issues due to the fact that so much time, effort and energy of the parents is focused on the child with the disability. As I acknowledged in my speech on the condolence motion for Tim Fischer last week, Dominic Fischer is such a wonderful sibling and brother to Harrison, and Tim and I would quite often speak about the impact that people like Dominic had on Harrison and the impact people like Millie and Rupert Hughes have on their brother, Fred Hughes, in my household. I know how important Clare Fraser is to Jack, and I know of a number of other children who are wonderful carers, wonderful influences and wonderful mentors to their siblings with a disability as well as great supports to their parents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge three wonderful autistic individuals and the contributions that they make to Australian society and community in general. Firstly, I'd like to acknowledge Tim and Judy Sharp. Tim is a brilliant artist and an autistic man with a mother who is just an absolutely dynamo. Tim is the developer of Laser Beak Man. The portrayal of Laser Beak Man in Tim's art has an incredible following, and the character has also been developed into a play, which is currently playing around Australia. The hero, Laser Beak Man, lives in Power City, the most beautiful city in the world, and he uses his laser to turn bad into good.</span>

As an old Adelaide girl, though, I will give that to you, Senator Farrell. Being born in Adelaide, it's a pretty good place to start. Tim and Judy Sharp really demonstrate what can be done when you work together as a family and a unit to create a successful business and go on to influence and inspire so many other families.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge Sam Best and his parents, James Best and Benison O'Reilly. I mentioned Benison in my first speech; she literally wrote the book on autism, with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian Autism Handbook</span>, both volumes one and two. Sam, her son, and James, her husband, travelled to Africa a couple of years ago and wrote a book and made a documentary of their experiences, demonstrating how the neuroplasticity of the brain in teen years can mean experiences and independence can be opened up when challenges are put in front of children who, far too often, parents are told will never achieve much. Sam Best made such a great leap forward in his own development and showed so many parents and other children what advances you can make when you challenge your teenagers; it's not just for younger children.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to also acknowledge Chris Varney, an autistic adult who set up the I CAN Network, which is so important, offering mentoring to other children on the autism spectrum and providing an autistic body in itself. I think that if those outside of the autistic community could start to really get a better understanding of the contribution that autistic people make, the supports that they require to make those contributions and the supports that they can provide to each other we would make this community and their lives so much better, and so much better for their families, moving forward.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to finish by paying tribute to the Prime Minister and the government for their focus on the NDIS: their assurance that it will be fit for purpose and that it will focus on ensuring that services and supports are available to all Australians should they require them going forward.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZE" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SESELJA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  It's great to get up and make a contribution on the election and the government's agenda on what is a very important debate. Certainly, I think that the 2019 federal election will go down as a critical election for many people. It was an unexpected election result but an election where I think it's very clear—and I think this was clear in the analysis both before the election and after—that the Australian people were faced with a very clear choice, and perhaps a clearer choice than they had been faced with in many, many years. It was a choice between the strong economic record of the Liberal and National parties in government, strong borders and strong communities, and a return to the deficit and despair offered by those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal-National government went to the election saying to the Australian people that if they had a go they would get a fair go. We support hard work, we support aspiration and we support a decent safety net for those who are struggling at various times in their lives to look after themselves, and we absolutely support people getting on and living their lives, making decisions for themselves and their families and being supported to do that in the best way they can. The government wants to say to those quiet Australians who supported us that we want to continue to deliver for them, that we are grateful and that we are humbled and honoured by the opportunity. I want to put on record again my thanks to people here in the ACT who have given me the opportunity and the great honour and privilege to be back in this place, and the government more broadly thanks those who, right around the country, made the decision to support the Liberal and National parties. We want to honour that by continuing to build on what we've been able to deliver in the last six years. We want to continue to go well beyond that. We want to create a further 1.25 million jobs over the next five years, building on the 1.4 million jobs created since we took government in 2013. Having got the budget back in the black, we want to continue our sound and sensible management of the nation's finances so that we can consistently and responsibly pay down Labor's debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's budget surplus, the first in 12 years, is a starting point for $45 billion in surpluses over the next four years. This is a significant step on the road to being free of net debt by around 2030. Because of our strong budgetary and economic management, we were able to promise much-needed tax relief to hardworking Australians. We're pleased to be delivering this tax relief for people right up and down the income scale—starting, most importantly, with low- and middle-income Australians. We are putting more money in their pockets so they can choose how they spend it: spending it on their families, on the essentials, on those little extras that improve people's lives or on contributing to their local communities, as so many Australians do through generous giving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever choices they want to make we want to support them, because we don't believe that the government knows best. Governments are very important, but we trust the Australian people to manage their money and, wherever we can, we want to return more of it to them. As I said, there was a really clear choice between that kind of strong budgetary management, strong economic management, strong borders and lower taxes versus what the Labor Party were offering. That would have destroyed our economy, whether it was through their raft of huge additional taxes hitting retirees, hitting superannuation, hitting home owners and renters or hitting income earners. This was a radical tax-and-spend agenda put forward by the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course there is much reading of the tea-leaves, soul-searching and all of those things, but the attack on aspiration, I think, was absolutely at the heart of what the Australian people were choosing to reject when it came to what the Labor Party were offering. I was interested in some of the analysis that said that, if you were a family with kids, if you were renting or if you didn't have a six-figure salary, you were more likely to swing towards the Liberal and National parties. I think that is critically important. Wee hear the rhetoric about the top end of town. Those people are not the top end of town; those people are hardworking Australians, often on pretty modest incomes—perhaps aspiring to have significantly higher incomes in years to come. They are saying to government: 'Well, get out of my way. Yes, we want you to deliver on the key services'—which this government is doing—'and we want strong economic management and budgetary management, so you can invest in health, education, defence, roads and other infrastructure—the NDIS, the PBS,' as we are doing. But these quiet Australians don't like being told what to do by government. They are good and decent people who don't like being told what to do and what to think. They're not going to cop the sort of sneering condescension from some people—people like Jane Caro, who said on election night that she was going to stick two rude fingers up at the truculent so-and-so who has voted to turn backwards. They're not going to cop it from people who say they're racist because they believe in controlling our borders. They're not going to cop it from people who say that they're bigots because they believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion. These are the quiet Australians who have made their voices heard very strongly at this election. And I think they're not going to cop it from greenies and others who fly into town and tell them that their industries should be killed in order to make green activists feel better about themselves, as we saw in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about one of the issues that I think was very critical in the election. It was critical in the election because the housing and property market is absolutely critical to all of us. It's not important just to the building industry, although there are hundreds of thousands of jobs—millions of jobs—in the property, building and construction industries. It's very important to those industries, but it's not important only to them. It's not important only to investors, although we know there are many Australians, and many low- and middle-income Australians, who invest in property as a way of providing for their families. We absolutely support them, but it's not important just to them. It's important to home owners, of course, as owner-occupiers. As we know, that is the largest asset that most of us will ever own, so an attack on property and on housing is an attack on Australians across the board.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, finally, it's also important to renters. Analysis has shown that high-renting electorates swung more strongly to the Liberal and National parties than other electorates around Australia. I don't think there are any surprises there, and I think this is one of the things the Labor Party missed. As we were going around the country and talking to people about the consequences of Labor's housing tax, their proposed changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax, we heard that renters actually would have been some of the hardest hit. Yes, you would have been hit if you were in the industry. Yes, you would have been hit if you were an owner-occupier. Yes, you would have been hit if you were an investor. But renters would have copped an absolute whacking. And it's important that people understand that this is a policy that the Labor Party still maintains. This is still their policy, the housing tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can go through the dozens of analysts who said: 'Your house price will go down. Thousands of jobs will be lost in the industry, and it will hit economic activity as a result. And renters will be whacked.' During the election the Labor Party tried to claim—and they would still, no doubt, maintain this—that actually it wouldn't increase rents. But we saw some really detailed analysis from a large number of different groups, who all came to the same conclusion: if you take away what is effectively a rental subsidy, if you have a special or different tax treatment for investment in residential property to what you have for investment in shares and other areas, well, guess who's going to pay for it? It'll be those who are renting, those who are already doing it tough and those who, in many cases, are doing it tougher than the rest of the community. We heard this from the Property Council, the Housing Industry Association, academics at the University of New South Wales, the founder of Binvested, the Real Estate Institute of New South Wales, SQM Research and dozens of other organisations; we heard them all coming to this conclusion. And SQM Research, who I think were rated by <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> as the most accurate residential property forecaster for about three years running, so come with significant credentials in analysing this, talked about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's look at what Labor's policy, which they still hold, would do. It would push rents in Perth up $72 a week. It would push rents in Brisbane up $91 a week. It would push rents in Melbourne up $65 a week. It would push rents in Sydney up $50 a week. It would push rents in Adelaide up $56 a week. It would push rents in Canberra up $55 a week. It would push rents in Hobart up $44 a week. It would push rents in Darwin up $15 a week. Overall, on average it would push up rents in the capital cities by $67 a week. That is what Labor's policy would do, and I think that was absolutely critical to the election result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw absolute hubris from the Labor Party on this, and on other issues, and I think that this was the other important message. We heard the stories about the Labor Party bullying people behind the scenes, saying, 'We're going to be in government soon.' We saw the pictures. I've got that lovely picture, the 'We're ready' picture with the then Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and a number of other Labor figures—the then shadow Treasurer—all there, posing, ready the move into The Lodge and deliver their tax and spend policies. They were ready to come in and push everyone's rents up, lower people's house values, hit retirees and put more taxes on hardworking Australians, who are working hard to save for their retirements. That's what they were planning, and the hubris that we saw was extraordinary. I haven't seen anything like it in any election campaign that I've been involved with. We're all aware of the then shadow Treasurer's comment, Mr Bowen's comment where he said, 'If you don't like our policies, well, go ahead and don't vote for us.' That was him effectively saying to retired Australians, who might be hit by his retiree tax, 'Well, we don't need you.' That was the message: 'We're not going to govern for everyone; we're going to govern for the 50 per cent plus one who we anticipate will vote for us as a result of these policies.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also saw Andrew Leigh, who is fond of demonstrating how much smarter he is than everyone, even though he's so often shown to be not across policy detail and to get the details completely wrong. He knew exactly how much money the retiree tax would bring in for the Labor Party if they were to have come into government and implemented it. Five times in one interview he was asked how many Australians would be affected by his policy, but he wouldn't answer. He ended up laughing off the question, dismissing it and claiming somehow that it didn't matter, that, because he didn't have his iPad in front of him, it didn't matter that 900,000 Australians would have been affected by that tax grab from the Labor Party. Mr Leigh was very happy to dismiss those concerns, because he thought that they were going to sail into government. There is no doubt that the Australian people responded in part to that. They responded to the higher taxes, to the whack on their home ownership, the whack on renters, the whack on aspiration and the whack on investors. We saw that throughout the campaign and on the night of the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been getting on with the job. We have re-established the ABCC. We've signed free trade agreements. We've expanded the coverage of our trade agreements from 26 per cent of two-way trade to nearly 70 per cent. We've kickstarted a massive infrastructure program. These are all things we can be very proud of. We're cutting taxes and delivering the budget back into surplus, all while being able to invest in absolutely critical areas—health, defence, roads and infrastructure, disability, the PBS. All of that can be done because we're delivering a strong economy and a strong budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I started by thanking those Australians who have supported our agenda and saying to them that we want to build on that so that we can continue to deliver good policies and that we don't take for granted their support. I would like to thank some people who did some outstanding work in the last term to highlight some of these policy issues. I would like to acknowledge a number of people in the industry who spoke out against Labor's housing tax. I was involved in holding forums around the country where we put the facts on the table in relation to what it would have done. It's difficult when you're told that one side of politics is definitely going to be in government. Some people won't want to argue against that side's policies, lest they be punished should that side come in. These people showed great integrity and the courage to say, 'This is what we believe. This is the evidence we see. We're going to make that argument, whether it's good for us personally or not.' They are people like Dave Bailey and Mark Hewitt at AFG, who really put out the messages in relation to mortgage brokers and their impacts and the impact of the housing tax; people like Mark Haron, Michael Williams, Doron Peleg, Emma Dupont-Brown, Ben Kingsley, Jock Kreitals from the Real Institute of Australia, Marissa Schulze from Rise High Financial Solutions; and people like Louis Christopher from SQM, who really put out some outstanding research that blew the whistle on what some of these policies would have done and that showed the policies would have hit a cross-section of the community. They would have not just hit jobs in the construction industry, investors and owner-occupiers but also and most particularly hit people who were renting. I think people did start to hear that message.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, all of us in the Senate and the House of Representatives know that it's a great, privileged position and that we can't do it without all of the people who support us in our offices and our party organisations. I'd like to pay tribute to some of the staff who assisted me during the 45th Parliament. I had some absolutely outstanding staff who worked extraordinary hours and who are very talented, very hardworking, very loyal and very bright. They bring so much, including strong values, to the way they deliver—not just for me but more particularly for the people of the ACT and the people of Australia—in the various roles that we have. I wanted to particularly pay tribute to Angela Inglis, Teaghan George, Cassandra Choake, Ben Dennehy, Veronica Hosking, Janet Parnwell, Elizabeth Storer, Matt Mitchell, Sarah Duffy, Andrew McIndoe, Zac Lombardo and Josh Goldsbrough, as well as some of our fantastic DLOs: Nicolle Sullivan, Samuel Burns, Daniel Craig, Morgan Ryan, and some of those who filled in here and there where needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to now also take a moment to pay tribute to a staff member of mine who has moved on, who was with me for a long, long time—a very loyal and faithful staffer who after six years has left my office. When I was first elected in 2013, Sam Mullins joined my office as an electoral officer, and over the years he has been an extraordinarily effective and capable adviser. As well as being a capable adviser, he and his lovely wife, Anna, are good friends with me and my wife, Ros, and our family. Sam has relocated to Sydney with his wife, who has taken up a role at Westmead Children's Hospital. I wanted to take the opportunity to wish them well for the future, but I also wanted to take the opportunity to specially pay tribute to Sam for his outstanding and loyal service and very much wish him all the best for the next stage of his journey.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition won the election. Scott Morrison ran an excellent campaign. But he was able to do so because of Labor's dud policies: negative gearing changes, which would have affected around 1.3 million Australians, especially mum-and-dad investors; franking credits, which hit hardworking retirees; the assault on the coal industry, which saw large swings in areas like Newcastle and in Queensland; and concerns about religious freedom, which manifested itself with the Israel Folau sacking. This was the sleeper issue of the election. Quiet Australians, the silent majority, rejected Labor's dud policies and returned the coalition to power. They voted to keep Labor and their fiscal vandalism away from the treasury bench. It is fair to say that the prospect of a Labor win, as the polls were predicting, had a negative impact on business and economic sentiment. Business owners speaking to coalition candidates expressed concerns about the effect of Labor policies on the economy. Labor was hiding what the impact of their high taxes would be on the economy, jobs, property values and the cost of rent. They were not to be trusted, and the electorate understood this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now return to His Excellency's speech. On the issue of trade, of course the US and China are important trade partners, but there are trade tensions between the two countries. It is now evident that the US believes that the rules based trading system in its current form is not capable of dealing with Beijing's economic structure and policy practices. Let us not forget that China is not a democracy; it is a Communist regime. Its values and beliefs are different to ours. The freedoms and practices that we take for granted are not the same under the Communist Party of China. The US has legitimate concerns. Forced technology transfers and unfair intellectual property theft cannot be justified, and industrial subsidies are promoting overproduction. The United States has acted responsibly, respecting the independence and sovereignty of other nation-states. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The level of global interconnectedness means that the need to maintain peace and stability that ultimately underpin our prosperity and prosperity of other countries has never been more has never been truer than today. As a rising power China now has additional responsibilities; therefore, it is important that these trade tensions are resolved within the broader context of international world order, under the WTO consistent rules that don't undermine the interests of parties like Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that our relationship with the United States has never been stronger, and it's important to note that. Ours is a resolute and mutually beneficial alliance and partnership, when neither party has the need to prove anything to the other. It is the bedrock of our security. Australia is a stronger regional power because of our alliance. As the US ambassador said earlier this year, Australia is the United States's most important economic partner, with two-way investment totalling A$1.6 trillion and a US$3 billion investment in Australia. We will work with like-minded countries to reform international institutions, including the WTO, to ensure that they are fit for purpose and serve members' interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has the most liberal foreign investment regime in our region. It is not possible for Australians to invest in China in the same way that Chinese investments are made here. This is unlikely to change and therefore our policies need to be framed in the national interest. We must retain our sovereignty over these investments, especially in relation to strategic and national security considerations. Whilst Beijing is our top two-way trading partner, I would like to stress the importance of diversification. On the issue of trade it should be 'fair trade' rather than 'free trade'. I believe that bilateral trade is preferable because multilateral trade can, and does, undermine fair trade. It begs the question: 'Free trade for whom?'—that is, free trade should not be a vehicle for wealth redistribution.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of infrastructure, I would like to highlight that the advent of the airport in south-western Sydney and the development of those areas have made access to coastal areas—and, most particularly, Port Kembla port—more vital, and hence the development of the Maldon-Dombarton rail line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of congestion in cities, especially in Western Sydney, it is important that we look to alternative areas for settlement. Since World War II we have welcomed over 7.5 million migrants to Australia, including about 850,000 under our humanitarian program. We have amongst the best settlement services in the world; however, with our humanitarian entrants there is a practice of locating new arrivals close to other people from their country of origin. With growing numbers in Western Sydney, the continuation of this practice will only compound existing congestion issues that need to be addressed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On defence, our decision to contribute to a naval presence in the Strait of Hormuz is a necessary one. Iran is not a good international citizen and does not commit to a rules based global culture. It is also time to scale down Garden Island and build a naval base at Port Kembla, with our new submarines as phase 1. Since this idea was first raised in 2006, the changing security environment and the planned commissioning of a variety of new warships in the coming years have increased pressure on existing facilities, necessitating the Navy's requirement for a new basing arrangement on the east coast. I and other stakeholders have been working together—and I thank the Labor Party and Labor members in the Illawarra for working in conjunction with stakeholders—to prepare necessary reports, which have been submitted to both state and federal governments.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our foreign policy white paper professes to be a projection of our values. It is important to stand by those values and not be clouded by commercial interests. This is what the Australian public expect. We support the international rules based order. We should vigorously support it and be engaged in promoting it. Stability, security and prosperity are Australia's primary objectives. Indeed, the stability and security of our region is second only to the defence of Australia. Beijing has denied reports of plans for a base in the region. We can only take this on face value. It would be of grave concern if any external power sought to establish a military base in the Pacific. Following on from my honest and forthright comments early in 2016, I have strongly advocated for Australia to shift its overseas development assistance footprint to the Pacific. During my time as Minister for International Development and the Pacific we had a record spend of $1.3 billion in the Pacific, and I strongly believe that we should spend a higher proportion of our ODA in the region. This is our neighbourhood, and our allies expect us to look after this part of the world. We need to stand up for our values and call out conduct that is not becoming of good international citizenry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the South China Sea, Beijing simply ignores the fact that it has no right under international law to any claim in the South China Sea. The unanimous ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 against China was that there was no legal basis to claim historic rights within sea areas falling within the nine-dash line. Beijing has failed the test of being a good international citizen in the South China Sea and should be held to account. We should be calling out Beijing, utilising our Navy and working with other countries to exercise right of innocent passage through international waters. Appeasement should never be an option, hence my comments about the inappropriateness of the visit by the amphibious assault group of three Chinese warships on the 30th anniversary of Tiananmen Square.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to recognise that over one million people of Chinese heritage live in Australia. Many have strong family and commercial ties to China; therefore, it is important to distinguish the actions of the communist regime in Beijing from the hardworking and industrious Chinese Australian community, who appreciate living in a democracy. Let us not forget that many of them fled oppression from the Communist Party of China.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Previous administrations made this choice in the hope that freedom in China would expand in all of its forms — not just economically, but politically, with a newfound respect for classical liberal principles, private property, personal liberty, religious freedom — the entire family of human rights.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was unfairly hung out to dry in January 2016, especially by the then foreign minister and defence minister, when I made comments about debt levels in the Pacific. My comments have been fully vindicated, and 'debt-trapped diplomacy' has now entered international parlance and the lexicon. Every time this issue is raised, it vindicates the stance that I took. I was pleased to have been the tip of the spear on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also pleased that I pushed for a much greater focus on the Pacific to ensure it was one of the five priorities of our foreign policy. Beijing is increasingly asserting its influence in the Pacific through its Belt and Road Initiative and its leveraging of debts of Pacific countries. About $1.5 billion of the about $5.5 billion debt owed by Pacific islands countries is owed to China, hence saddling our neighbours with more debt is not in the long-term interests of the Pacific.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have preferred to see our $3 billion assistance spent in two ways: weatherproofing critical infrastructure like schools, community halls and hospitals through capitalisation of an independent Pacific resilience fund, mobilising private sector investment in larger infrastructure projects through our Efic initiative; and Australia's support being an innovative combination of grants and private sector support. I fear that utilising $2.5 billion of that amount in loans is only going to exacerbate an already heavy debt burden on our Pacific neighbours.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Pacific Islands Forum meeting in 2016 it was agreed that there would be a framework for resilient development in the Pacific, and therefore I strongly support the establishment of the Pacific Resilience Fund. As minister, I put in train a lot of the work being now rolled out as the Pacific Step-up. Given 35 trips, I saw for myself firsthand what was happening in the Pacific and the impact of debt distress. My honest and forthright comments last year stimulated an international debate and focused on debt not just in the Pacific—hence, I am concerned about policies that would increase debt.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On climate issues, our strategic policy should reflect the need for clean air, clean water and a clean food chain. CO2 is not a pollutant but a clean, odourless and colourless gas vital for the health of our planet through the generation of oxygen by the process of photosynthesis and the role of phytoplankton. This is not, however, what is being taught in our schools today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw firsthand the disgraceful behaviour of climate activists in the Stegall campaign in Warringah, including by GetUp!. It was hypocritical when people pulled up in their gas-guzzling SUVs and proceeded to take the Stegall and GetUp! how-to-vote cards. They were working in tandem on that campaign. What really concerned me about that campaign was the anxiety of a young girl who was in tears; she thought the world was going to end if there was no action on climate change. It brought home to me the false and misleading narrative used by GetUp! and the climate change lobby. As one voter said to me, 'This is a form of brainwashing and is tantamount to child abuse.'</span>

It should be called out for what it is, and those who support and conduct such dangerous activities should be held accountable. The recent fires in Queensland, New South Wales and elsewhere have, I fear, a disturbing element of potential ecoterrorism. Those under-aged offenders need to be asked to determine any link between their dangerous actions and those who might influence their behaviour. We, as a government and as a society, owe it to our communities who have lost everything.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an ageing and culturally diverse Australia, I am concerned that there needs to be major reform of the aged-care sector. I envisage that this will have to occur after the royal commission delivers its findings. As someone who became a founding board member of an aged-care facility at age 23, I am concerned at the lack of progress that we have made. My father passed away three years ago after a long battle with dementia and my mother is in care. I have seen the interaction of the aged-care and health systems firsthand, and there is the need for a lot of improvement. It is complicated and challenging, especially for older Australians whose knowledge of English is limited and deteriorates with age.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support a federal integrity commission. Integrity in government is vital, especially as faith in the political class diminishes in the public's mind. Whilst we need to learn from the mistakes of the New South Wales ICAC processes, nevertheless, revelations in my home state have shown the importance of accountability of the political class. Regrettably, I suspect a federal body will have its fair share of work to do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to conclude with some comments on religious freedom. During the election campaign, a consequence of the advent of the Israel Folau issue was that it only deepened the concerns of Australians of family and faith. At the kitchen table, Australians of family and faith were concerned. They asked, 'If I say something about my religion, will I find myself in trouble?' When freedom of speech, thought, conscience and belief are framed only as exemptions to other rights they are read down against positive rights, rendering them subordinate to those other rights. During the election campaign it was very clear that there was a strong perception that Scott Morrison, our first Pentecostal Prime Minister, rather than Bill Shorten, would protect religious freedom, and many of those quiet Australians who voted for the coalition, especially in religiously and culturally diverse communities in Labor's heartland seats in Western Sydney, did so in the expectation that their religious freedoms would be protected. A regime of positive rights in the form of religious freedom legislation would give greater effect to the right to manifest one's freedom of thought, conscience and belief as outlined in article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians voted yes for same-sex marriage on the understanding that religious freedoms would be protected. At a speech at the National Press Club in 2015, I foreshadowed that culturally and religiously diverse areas in Australia would vote strongly against same-sex marriage. Indeed, this was the case. Of the 17 electorates that voted no, 12 were in New South Wales, with the majority falling in Western Sydney. Eight of the top 10 no votes were in Labor seats. Consequently, as I predicted, we are now attempting to unscramble the egg. The results from the 18 May election showed strong swings against Labor of up to seven per cent, especially in its electoral heartland of Western Sydney. What is even more remarkable about these swings—which went to Liberal candidates who had only been in the field for a short period of time—is that, most especially, these were the same seats that strongly voted no in the same-sex marriage postal survey in 2017. There is now, I have to say, greater pressure on us as a government to deliver to retain that electoral support. The test of whether those expectations have been fully met will depend on what religious leaders advise their congregations. Their views will be paramount in influencing the views of their flocks in the lead-up to the next election. In short: at the kitchen table, Australian families of faith have to know that if they quote their bible they will not be in trouble. This is now the test, and any doubt in their minds will have political ramifications. I conclude by saying that at the last election we ran a very good campaign capitalising on Labor's dud policies. It may not always be the case.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:16</span>):  As I commence my contribution to respond to the Governor-General's speech, I would firstly like to acknowledge the successful return of the Morrison coalition government at the election held earlier this year and to acknowledge all involved, especially those from my home state, Tasmania. As my colleagues on this side of the chamber would appreciate, the Liberal-National coalition is the government for all Australians. On our benches we have doctors, farmers, soldiers, lawyers, mothers, fathers, police officers, nurses and the list goes on. We're the government for all Australians, and at this election the people of Australia had a clear choice, and once again they put their trust in us. They believe that the coalition government will deliver lower taxes, will lower their power bills, will support the nation's small businesses and will lower the cost of life-saving medicines. Aspirational Australians want to have the opportunity to achieve their goals, and they believe and understand that we will support them. We will and are delivering on our commitments.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to Tasmania, I would like to congratulate my good friend and now parliamentary colleague Bridget Archer on being elected as the member for Bass. I observed firsthand her dedication and commitment during the campaign and believe she will be an outstanding advocate and champion for the people of Northern Tasmania. The seat of Braddon was also returned to the Liberal Party, with Gavin Pearce being elected as the member for Braddon. A former soldier with over 20 years of military service both at home in Australia and leading troops overseas on operations, he too will serve his electorate well. I would like to congratulate them both on their success and thank their campaign committees, volunteers and the Liberal Party members across the state for their wonderful support throughout the campaign. My Tasmanian Liberal Senate colleagues also deserve acknowledgement. I acknowledge Senator the Hon. Richard Colbeck on his re-election to the Senate and his appointment as Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians and Minister for Youth and Sport. Congratulations and a warm welcome to Senator Claire Chandler, who joined us in the Senate in July and has certainly hit the ground running. Following the election, Senator the Hon. Jonathon Duniam was appointed as Assistant Minister for Forestry and Fisheries, Assistant Minister for Regional Tourism and Deputy Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I have no doubt that Senator Duniam will continue his strong advocacy for regional Tasmania and regional Australia in these roles. Thanks also to Senator the Hon. Eric Abetz, who worked alongside the campaign both in Tasmania and across Australia to help secure the coalition victory.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past five years, the Tasmanian economy has made a remarkable recovery. It is no coincidence that this recovery occurred under state Liberal and federal coalition governments. Under re-elected state Liberal and federal coalition governments, the rebuilding of the Tasmanian economy will continue. Economic indicators in categories such as GDP, exports, employment and retail spending fluctuate over time and will continue to do so. They are subject to outside influences, and there is no doubt that there will be economic challenges ahead for our nation and Tasmania, but both Tasmanian and federal economies are now in a much better position to weather any economic headwinds that may come our way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the doom and gloom we often hear from Labor and the Greens, the economic data shows that the Tasmanian economy is now in very good shape. However, that was not the case in 2013, when the coalition came to power in Canberra. Back then, the Tasmanian economy was a basket case. It had the lowest gross state product per capita in Australia, the nation's highest unemployment rate and the lowest population growth. It had the highest proportion of Australians without superannuation and the lowest proportion of adults in the nation who had finished year 12, and it had one of the lowest retention rates to year 12. In 2013 Tasmania lagged behind the nation on almost every economic indicator. Between 2010 and 2014 about 11,000 full-time jobs were lost in Tasmania under the Labor-Green governments of David Bartlett and Lara Giddings. Traditional industries like forestry were being destroyed by the Labor-Green government, with no plan to replace the economic hit. Approximately half the state was locked up while every year Australia was importing $2 billion in forestry products. At that time, Tasmania was in desperate need of policy coherence between the state and federal governments to respond to the many challenges it was facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's economic growth plan for Tasmania was launched in 2013. It provided the architecture to help turn Tasmania's economic fortunes around and encourage long-term, sustainable growth. With the support of the coalition economic growth plan, Tasmanian Liberal leader Will Hodgman took his blueprint for a modern economy to the 2014 state election. The Hodgman blueprint was based on Tasmania's competitive strengths. It was designed to create jobs, fix the Labor-Green budget mess, encourage investment, rebuild essential services and cut red and green tape. It was a plan that was resoundingly endorsed by Tasmanians at the 2014 state election, and it was a plan that worked, and continues to work, despite revenue downgrades due to smaller GST distributions, decreased stamp duty receipts, unprecedented demand for public health services and the devastating summer bushfires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the Morrison government, the Tasmanian Liberal government has got its budget back in order, eliminating deficits and building surpluses for the future. Last financial year Tasmania's economic growth was better than the national average and, per capita, Tasmania is growing at its fastest rate in a decade—nearly double the national average. Premier Will Hodgman said in his 2019 State of the State address that Tasmania is growing like never before. He said that respected economists have reported that, for the first time in 27 years, economic growth in Tasmania is now based broadly across all industry sectors. It is a wonderful achievement and is allowing the Tasmanian government, in partnership with the Morrison government, to build important social infrastructure. That means better schools, hospitals, housing and roads—all of those things that are improving the liveability and the productivity of Tasmania.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of expert sources concur on the great improvement in the Tasmanian economy. In July, Moody's Investor Service credit opinion of the Tasmanian government's finances noted that 'despite softer economic conditions throughout the nation, the Tasmanian economy was resilient and diverse and continued to perform above its long-term trend'. Moody's identified the tourism industry as a driver of employment growth and private investment. Tourism Tasmania figures for the year to March 2019 show visitor numbers grew by three per cent to 1.32 million, with visitor spending reaching a record $2.49 billion—an increase of five per cent over the previous year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are coming to Tasmania from interstate and overseas for a variety of reasons. They are coming to experience the state's wild places, to visit the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart and other cultural attractions, and to ride on the growing number of mountain bike trails in Tasmania. Since 2013, federal coalition governments have provided $2.5 million for mountain bike developments in north-eastern Tasmania, including the now famous Blue Derby Mountain Bike Trails. Mountain bike trails are helping to rebuild the economies of towns like Scottsdale and Derby in Tasmania's north-east, local economies hard-hit by the Labor-Green policies on forestry. The federal government is supporting similar developments in other parts of the state, such as the Wild Mersey Mountain Bike Trails between Sheffield and Railton, and the St Helens Mountain Bike Trails due to be opened in the next few weeks. Visitor numbers are also being boosted by business events. More than 36,000 delegates attended business events and conferences in Tasmania last year, injecting almost $150 million into the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">CommSec is another source reflecting the vastly improved conditions of the Tasmanian economy in 2019 compared to 2013, when the state was on the bottom of just about every economic indicator. CommSec's <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the states</span> report earlier this year ranked Tasmania's economy the equal third strongest in the nation. Tasmania was ranked first on population growth and business investment, and second on housing finance. The report noted that higher population growth had the spin-off effect of driving new home purchases and business growth. Last year interstate migration to Tasmania reached its highest level in nearly 15 years. Mainlanders are looking to Tasmania for a cooler, more relaxed lifestyle—as I mentioned in my first speech, a 'Tassie change'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing affordability is a huge issue at the moment right across Australia, but, despite rising property values, Tasmanian real estate remains eminently affordable compared to many mainland centres. According to the Real Estate Institute of Tasmania, in March this year the median price for a house was $483,750 in greater Hobart, $342,500 in Launceston and $275,000 on the north-west coast. And I can tell you that those figures will get you a great home in a wonderful environment, with all the necessary facilities close by, along with beaches, mountains and beautiful, unspoiled countryside a short distance away. Have I sold you?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that there is a lot more to do in relation to housing affordability and homelessness, and the Morrison government is committed to continuing to focus on the supply of more social housing in Tasmania. This was evidenced recently when Minister for Housing and Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Michael Sukkar MP, agreed to waive Tasmania's housing related debt to the Commonwealth, in recognition of the unique challenges with housing affordability and homelessness in the state. Continued improvement in this area is only possible with a strong economy at both a state and federal level—in Tasmania's case, an economy increasingly bolstered by exports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to ABS data released earlier this month, the estimated nominal value of overseas merchandise exports from Tasmania increased to $3.71 billion. Mainland China was the largest importer of Tasmanian goods in the year to July 2019, accounting for 31.7 per cent of the state's total nominal value of exports. Hong Kong and China together were estimated to have accounted for 35 per cent of total Tasmanian exports in the year to July 2019, but it's not just China that is increasingly taking Tasmanian minerals and agricultural goods. Exports to the USA were up $31 million, or 16 per cent, mainly due to increases in non-ferrous metals and ores. Exports to Indonesia were up $29 million, or over 15 per cent. Exports to Thailand were up $13 million, or 6.7 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seafood, dairy and horticultural products are among the other Tasmanian goods winning overseas markets. The latest data from the Tasmanian Department of State Growth shows that seafood products, predominantly Atlantic salmon and abalone, are now worth more than wood and paper products to the Tasmanian economy. And the dairy industry is growing in importance. Over the past five years, the export of dairy products was up $43 million, or 43.7 per cent. Overseas food exports from Tasmania are increasing, up almost eight per cent to a record $740 million in the financial year 2017-18, with Asia increasing in importance to the Tasmanian economy. In the year to May 2019, China, including Hong Kong, accounted for 31 per cent of Tasmania's agricultural and seafood exports. Around 20 per cent of Tasmania's agricultural goods and seafood were exported to Japan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In some sectors the increase in export value has been spectacular. Fruit production, for example, has increased by 212 per cent since 2013-14, to $197 million in 2017-18. The Korea, China and Japan free trade agreements negotiated by the coalition government in 2014 and 2015 are clearly delivering benefits to the Tasmanian economy. The coalition's support of irrigation schemes in Tasmania is also of great importance to ensuring supply for these Tasmanian exports. Since 2013 we've invested $300 million in Tasmanian irrigation schemes. With farmers and the state government we are helping secure and improving existing agricultural activities and making possible the development of exciting new rural enterprises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania is a regional and rural economy, and the Prime Minister spoke recently of the importance of regional Australia to our national economy. He noted that, with a population that has shifted massively to the larger cities over the past 50 years, we tend to forget the contribution of our regional based industries. In Tasmania, that became particularly evident, with many national businesses centralising their administrations in Melbourne or Sydney, with senior and higher paid staff lost to the state. But, as the Prime Minister pointed out, one key aspect of economic resilience in regional areas is the creation of a diversified economy. The coalition government is helping Tasmania to achieve that goal with practical support for sectors such as higher education, horticulture and tourism. The Morrison government also recognises that small to medium businesses are key drivers in regional economies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has said, what is in the interest of rural and regional Australians is in the national interest. This commitment to regional economies like Tasmania's will be supported by the Morrison government's plan to keep our economy strong, to keep Australians safe and to keep Australians together. Tasmanian exporters will be among those benefiting from existing and new trade deals, which by the end of this term will cover around 90 per cent of Australian trade. This government will be returning the budget to surplus—the first surplus in 12 years—and will deliver surpluses over the forward estimates. That's a predicted $45 billion in surpluses over the next four years. And, despite the unconscionable opposition of Labor and the Greens, the government's first legislative act was to provide tax relief for hardworking Australians earning up to $126,000 a year, and lifting the tax threshold over the next five years. Our plan for tax relief also includes small, medium and family businesses. A stronger economy means more Australians getting into better paid jobs, and there will be a focus on regional areas of the country, like Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our job creation plan comes with a $585 million commitment to improving skills and training, creating 80,000 new apprenticeships and establishing 10 new industry training hubs in key locations of high youth unemployment in regional Australia. The apprentice wage subsidy trial will be doubled to help 3,200 young Australians in regional and rural areas get the jobs and the qualifications they need. Australians who want to return to the workforce will be assisted by the government's new program called Mid-Career Checkpoint. Nationally, this program will support up to 40,000 people, particularly women, to return to the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong economy allows us to invest in education. Every Australian, from early childhood to university, should have access to a quality education. In Tasmania, education, along with tourism and horticulture, is one of those sectors that are helping to diversify the local economy. When opening this parliament, His Excellency the Hon. David Hurley AC, DSC noted that a strong economy creates a stronger society. A strong economy allows more spending on schools and hospitals and allows the government to subsidise more medicines, fund better roads, and provide more support to Australia's rural and regional communities. And, just as importantly, a strong economy makes us more resilient in uncertain economic times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state, the Tasmanian economy today is a far cry from the mess left by the Labor-Greens government back in 2014. It is an economy that has been rebuilt by a coalition government in Canberra and a Liberal government in Tasmania. It is an outstanding example of policy coherence between state and federal governments to respond to the many economic challenges we face.</span>

                  <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  As a servant of the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to discuss some of the core concepts behind the Governor-General's speech. The Governor-General spoke about the need for government to provide the environment in which people can produce and thrive. What I will do today is present basic facts and let the people decide themselves, let the people make their verdict. I want to focus, in particular, on our country's productive capacity. That is what will keep us going in the future, unless we continue to destroy it, which has been the case for the last 20 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three issues that I really focus on. The first is cost of living, and included in that are energy costs. We went from having the lowest electricity prices in the world to the world's highest. The second aspect of cost of living is taxation, and the third aspect is economic mismanagement, which is paid for by every person in this country. My second topic is security, and in relation to that I want to talk about immigration. The third point I want to talk about is future-building: the productive capacity of the future of our country that our children and grandchildren will inherit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to cost of living, security and future-building, there is a fundamental need to address governance—to restore governance in this country and to restore sovereignty. I will quote from a former, well-regarded Liberal premier on that. And underneath it all I want to discuss freedom and rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, I will make some basic comments. Listening to the government, one would think they did well at the last election. They didn't do well; Bill Shorten did poorly. The Senate is elected directly, and therefore there is no House of Representatives mandate standing over us. There is an arrogance in the government, which think they have a mandate. They have a mandate in the House of Representatives, but this is the house of review and this house is known for standing up for the people. We represent the people of our states. Every one of us in here should be representing the people of our states. And yet, the people of the states do not trust Liberal or Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the last election. In Queensland, the Liberal Party got 38.9 per cent of the vote in the Senate and 43.7 per cent in the House of Representatives. Across Australia, the Liberal Party got 41.4 per cent. It was actually one per cent lower than the election result in 2016, under Malcolm Turnbull's leadership. People don't know that: the Liberal Party went backwards in terms of total vote across the country. The Labor Party—and this is where some real shocks are coming—got 22.6 per cent in the Senate for Queensland, 26.7 per cent in the House of Representatives in Queensland; and 33 per cent across Australia. One Nation got 10.3 per cent in the Senate, or almost half what Labor got, 8.9 per cent in the House of Representatives, and 3.1 per cent across Australia. The United Australia Party, despite spending tens of millions of dollars, managed 3.4 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Liberal and Labor combined won 61.5 per cent of the vote in the Senate for Queensland. That's under two-thirds of the vote. They won 70.4 per cent in the House of Representatives. Across Australia, 74.7 per cent voted for the Liberal or Labor parties: one-quarter didn't. But in the Senate, almost 40 per cent of voters in Queensland voted for someone other than the Liberal-Labor duopoly, and almost one in three voted for someone other than the Liberal-Labor duopoly in the House of Representatives. And here's why: it's because the productive capacity of our country is being decimated by the Liberal-Labor duopoly. The government, under the Liberal and Labor parties, has inflicted disasters in energy policies and in agriculture. That is directly affecting the cost of living. And I'm talking about both state and federal Labor and Liberal, not just federal. Are people aware of this? Yes, they are. Are people in this parliament aware of this? I don't think so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at some of the things that have driven farmers to despair—and I do mean despair—from Queensland, through the Murray-Darling Basin and into Victoria, across all the eastern states. Let's have a look at No. 1: property rights. They were stolen under the leadership of the John Howard government in 1996, in a deal done with the Rob Borbidge National Party government to steal farmers' property rights to comply with the United Nations Kyoto protocol. There was no data underpinning that protocol to justify its existence and to justify the Howard government's stealing of private property rights. What's more, those property rights were stolen in direct contravention of the Constitution by going around the Constitution; instead of giving just-terms compensation to farmers, they stole farmers' property rights by getting the state governments to do it. Peter Beattie is on record admitting that. Bob Carr is on record publicly admitting that. The Liberal Party and the Labor Party colluded at the state and federal levels to steal farmers property rights. Right now, up in Charleville, there is a man, Dan McDonald, who is fighting through the courts because he has been branded a criminal for feeding his cattle as a result of legislation that has been enabled by the Liberal-Labor duopoly. That is destroying the productive capacity. We call for restoration of those property rights or for compensation. It is not only Dan McDonald: Sharon Lohse, another farmer, is being decimated by state government extrapolation of that property rights theft. Peter Spencer: who knows about that man who almost died protesting the Liberal Party's stealing of property rights?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second topic affecting agriculture is water, or, should I say, the lack of water, driven by the UN's Rio declaration, again foreign imposed. It was signed up to by Paul Keating's Labor government on this occasion—again, the UN; again, no data backing it up; again, Liberal and Labor continue to implement the policy, destroying our productive capacity. We know of people such as Louise Burge, Chris Brooks and Graham Pyle in southern New South Wales whose livelihoods have been threatened because of a lack of water that is due to the mismanagement and, dare I say it, corruption that is across the Murray-Darling Basin as a result of policies driven by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to energy, there is nothing more important to modern society than energy. Since the 1850s we've seen a relentless decrease in the price of energy, thanks to technology, until about 10 or 15 years ago, and now we've seen a doubling of electricity prices. The thing that's given us our material wellbeing, our standard of living and our ever-increasing wealth until recently has been ever-cheaper energy. Now the UN has a deliberate policy of increasing electricity prices, increasing fuel prices and increasing gas prices, and Liberal and Labor are doing it, based on the UN's Kyoto protocol, with no data to justify it. We now have a situation where farmers in Queensland—southern Queensland, central Queensland and Northern Queensland—are not growing fodder in a serious drought, because they can't afford to pump the water, because of electricity prices. I can think of someone up north, Debbie Gibson, who told me of her problems when I was listening to farmers in Townsville just two weeks ago. Then we have the ridiculous situation of carbon farming, of tying up land and making it possible to become the habitat of feral animals and noxious weeds. That means extra costs for neighbouring farmers because of the extra management required because of those feral animals and noxious weeds. Carbon farming is based on the UN's Kyoto protocol and Paris Agreement, but, again, there is no data; again, it is being pushed by the Liberal and Labor parties; and, again, it is destroying the productive capacity of our vital industries. Kate Stewart and others are being hurt by this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now in Queensland we are seeing soil and chemical run-off laws that are not based on data but are, again, complying with the UN's Kyoto protocol and Rio de Janeiro declaration. Liberal and Labor have been pushing this. This is a Labor extension of it that is destroying productive capacity. I think of the member for Mirani, Steve Andrew, who has been doing wonderful work with canegrowers to offset this and trying to come up with a far better solution, but no-one in the government is listening. Many canegrowers have recycle pits to catch and re-use the water. It doesn't run off their property. Why would they want it to run off their property when it's so valuable? But the bureaucrats and the Labor Party assume that all land from Cairns to Bundaberg to the Tweed is the same and uses the same quantity of fertiliser. Who's paying for this? The people in the supermarkets are paying for this and the farmers' families are paying for this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to fishing, the UN's Rio de Janeiro declaration of 1992, signed, as I said, by Paul Keating's government, is backed by no data, but the Liberal and Labor parties are pushing it, destroying productive capacity. We now have the world's largest continental shelf fishing zone, yet we import three-quarters of the seafood our people in Australia consume. I'm thinking of people like Timsey, who have to deal with the bureaucrats, deal with faulty electronics imposed upon them by the government and deal with faulty regulations that are trapping them needlessly and for no benefit to the Barrier Reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I think about forestry and listening to forestry workers and associated people at Maryborough recently, where they had a big, very well-attended protest. This is all, again, based upon the UN's Rio declaration, based on no data, pushed by the Liberal and Labor parties and destroying our destructive capacity. Think of families like Brett and his wife.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then I raise the issue of trigger mapping. This is bureaucracy gone mad. Lang Park, a stadium in Brisbane, is now, according to the government's trigger mapping, a site for valuable species threatened with extinction. This is all done to control land. Bruce Wagner has been doing this voluntarily for years. He has gone out and got the government's data and exposed it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will quote next from a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Rebuilding the Federation </span>by former Premier of Western Australia Richard Court, who wrote this book in 1994: 'The driving feature of Commonwealth-state financial relations is the states' heavy reliance on Commonwealth funding to supplement their own source revenue. Currently'—remember, this is 1994—'the states receive approximately 50 per cent of their total revenue from the Commonwealth, and with that funding comes strings, restrictions.' So who is running the states? In many ways, it is now the federal government. Whether it's Liberal or Labor, it doesn't seem to matter in many areas, because there is so little accountability in the federal arena.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also see Richard Court go on, and this is the point I want to make, 'This is what is destroying our country's productive capacity, and our children and their grandchildren will be paying for this.' Quoting again from Richard Court: 'The Commonwealth is using the external affairs power to govern Australian citizens, often rushing to sign international covenants which trample on their existing rights. These agreements are made primarily by people outside Australia. The terms and conditions are set by officials from other countries. While Australia takes part in the negotiations, it does not exercise a dominant influence. The foreign countries do. We never see them, we never meet them and we cannot question them.' He then goes on to discuss the process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me also quote from Maurice Strong, the founder and the first Secretary-General of the United Nations' Environmental Programme, a corrupt and destructive political force masquerading as an environmental force. He signed off in his introduction, the forward to the Earth Summit's Agenda 21, the United Nations program of action from Rio:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">There is much to be done.

                <span class="HPS-Small">by Governments, United Nations organizations, development agencies, non-governmental organizations and independent-sector groups, in every area in which human activity impacts on the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Agenda should be studied in conjunction with both the Rio Declaration—which provides a context for its specific proposals—and the statement of forest principles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the blueprint right there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've seen Canada evaluate the United Nations Agenda 21. They said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The reasons for undertaking this analysis of Agenda 21 were threefold. First, because the document is so lengthy, complex, and complicated, there was a need to understand the contents of Agenda 21, the interrelationships between the different themes and sectors, and the types of programs or activities which were advocated and agreed to by the negotiators of Agenda 21 …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'm saying to that is that even the Canadians, who drove a lot of it, can see that Agenda 21 is so complex that people don't understand. Many people in this house and many people in the House of Representatives do not even know of Agenda 21, yet are pushing regulations through that are enabling Agenda 21. Maurice Strong said he had two objectives, and they were to deindustrialise Western civilisation and to put in place an unelected socialist global governance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's continue to the topic of energy. I talked a minute ago about the primacy of energy. John Howard's government made three massive changes. First of all, he brought in the Renewable Energy Target at two per cent. It's now at 14 per cent. The Liberal-National party want to take it to 28 per cent. It's already crippling our electricity prices, and they want to double it. The Labor Party want to quadruple it, and the Greens—as Lenin said, 'the useful idiots for the United Nations'—want to make it 100 per cent renewable energy, and it can't be done without subsidies. It's already destroying our electricity prices and making them the highest in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing with regard to electricity prices is that we have the gold-plating of the networks, poles and wires because they've now been turned into corporations, not state government departments. Corporations are there to make profits and provide a return, which is simply a tax on the state government. We have the retailers' guaranteed returns. And what do they do? They just clip the ticket as it goes through so that the public can pay even more for their electricity. Then we have the National Electricity Market, put in place by Liberal and Labor, which is open to gaming and is being gamed, and is open to gouging and is being gouged, or rather the taxpayers are being gouged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have subsidies to some of the world's largest companies for installing solar panels in our country and installing wind turbines in our country—subsidies that we pay in higher electricity prices. So we export our natural gas and export our other energy and coal, and we send it to China and other countries. They send it back as wind turbines and send it back as solar panels, and then we pay Chinese companies—for example, in the case of Goldwind—to install these things and to take up valuable farming land in doing so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're destroying our productive capacity. High-productivity agricultural land is being destroyed and turned into a wasteland, and we're now putting in place low energy density solar panels and low energy density wind complexes, and that is raising the price of electricity. It is unavoidable; it will continue to raise the price of electricity. What's more, we're paying the Chinese to do this. I've got nothing against the Chinese for trying to do that; we're the stupid ones doing it. In 1942, the Japanese bombed Darwin. The Prime Minister at the time, John Curtin, did not send a cheque to the Japanese saying, 'Thanks for destroying our productive capacity; let's help you pay for the bombs.' But that is what we're doing to the Chinese companies here destroying our capacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we will do as One Nation is make sure that the public continues to hear about the destruction of our productive capacity under the Liberal-Labor duopoly. We will continue to take the action that's needed to protect that capacity. We will say the things that need to be said and do the things that need to be done. We will speak up and serve Australia because we love our country. We love Australia and we love the people here, and One Nation will work to bring back Australia's productive capacity.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  I rise to speak on my first address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech. I note it was also the first speech to this chamber of the new Governor-General, His Excellency the Hon. David Hurley. I congratulate him on his appointment. He comes with a distinguished career of military service to his country—namely, as a former chief of defence forces. Of course, he will be familiar to his current role, having been a governor of New South Wales. I wish the Governor-General and his wife, Linda, well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition are the custodians entrusted by the Australian people to form government. The coalition government tested their tax plan against Labor's tax plan at the last election. The result could not have been starker. It was to tax less versus to tax more. The Australian people saw our plan and they voted for it. They saw our leader, Scott Morrison, and they voted for him. The coalition's consistent and proven ability to manage the economy was, as I see it, a key reason for not only holding onto government but being returned with an increased majority at the last federal election. But, of course, not all is economic. Good economic management is just the first step towards prosperity, and it becomes self-evident that a strong economy is the foundation upon which jobs, wages and social growth can bloom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've maintained our AAA credit rating. This means we're saving more as we're paying less to borrow. The benefits are not just for government; it flows on through to a lower cost of borrowing for the corporate sector. We've just recorded a current account surplus for the first time since 1975. We are on track to deliver a surplus this year, the first since Peter Costello's in the financial year 2007-08. History has shown that many, if not most, Australians will be reticent to place preference on reformist agendas at the ballot box if they have faith in the government's ability to keep the cost-of-living expenses down and believe economic security will remain in their daily lives. In this election, they kept that faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When people's jobs and finances are secure, it allows governments greater room to put forth policies around important issues of social merit without perceived risk to individuals' own wealth. It also means that we have the budget to ensure our Defence servicemen and women have the kit they require. I'm proud that our government has committed to spending two per cent of GDP on our defence budget. That means we can play our part in enforcing the rules based order that ensures our region is more stable, secure and prosperous. As part of the largest step up of our Australian military in peacetime history, there will be $200 billion of investment over the next decade. I'm pleased that this has translated to more and more Australian small and medium enterprises playing an increasing role in delivering for our Defence Force. They are the workforce behind the Defence Force. By building our sovereign industrial capability, we're using our defence dollar not only to ensure our servicemen and women have the kit they require but also to ensure we are able to create Australian jobs and drive our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time left I would like to focus particularly on the issue of the environment. As I said in my maiden speech last week, I believe in the importance of personal responsibility. I'm also conscious that we do not live in a perfect world and therefore sometimes the role of government extends to incentivising, or disincentivising, when it is for the common good. The government is integrated with our standard of living. To this end, the coalition government has a proud record of investing in and improving the environment. There are the iconic issues, such as the Great Barrier Reef, in which the government is investing some $1.2 billion. Or there's the big and complex new issue of recycling waste, a newer problem that ranges from local government level up to federal government level. Single-use plastic is an issue that, if resolved, will help the environment in real time and locally. A pragmatic solution must be found that protects our oceans and waterways and that leads to practical action that will require more than just virtue signalling.</span>

The Minister for the Environment has said realistic targets have 100 per cent of Australia's packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Such a target is absolutely a step in the right direction. But I believe that it should be coupled with the carefully crafted program that both incentivises and pressures industry to adopt cleaner alternatives and better product stewardship by stimulating innovation where cleaner solutions are currently lacking. If products can reasonably be replaced with current alternatives—</span>

Last week, media reports revealed security agencies had advised former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull not to attend a meet and greet function in February 2018 due to the associations of guests invited by Ms Liu. According to leaked preselection documents, Ms Liu claims to have raised in excess of $1 million for the Liberal Party. What steps has the Prime Minister taken to assure himself that funds raised by Ms Liu are from appropriate sources and have been properly disclosed?</span>

Obviously, questions in relation to declarations of political donations are a matter for party organisations. We also note that the member for Chisholm has stated very clearly that at all times she has complied with relevant state and federal disclosure laws, and the Victorian division of the Liberal Party have also advised that all requirements have been complied with.</span>

The member for Chisholm, who is a long-time Liberal, has a history of supporting the Liberal Party. That's great news. Let's stop the front pages. Breaking news: the member for Chisholm, a long-term member of the Liberal Party, supported the Liberal Party before being elected by the people of Chisholm as a member of parliament. </span>

No-one has brought to my attention an example where claims against other parties had been deemed to be unparliamentary. I'll review exactly what Senator Cormann said, but I did not hear anything unparliamentary then. On the point of order, there wasn't a point of order on direct relevance. Senator Cormann's at liberty to continue for 33 seconds. He's concluded his answer? Senator Gallagher.</span>

Through multiple royal commissions we have seen the law-breaking culture that lies at the heart of some registered organisations that simply refuse to play by the rules. The CFMMEU, for example, an organisation very familiar to members opposite, has breached industrial laws alone three times per week, on average, over the course of the last 15 years.</span>

                  </span>Your glass jaw is showing, Senator Watt. It has racked up $16.4 million in court ordered penalties from more than 2,100 offences. Just last week, we heard Justice Mortimer of the Federal Court observe the following when imposing yet another fine on the CFMMEU. She said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">She also observed that continuing to impose fines on the CFMMEU in the hope it will have a deterrent effect 'appears to me to be engaging in something of a fiction.' It's clear that existing deterrents are not working, and that's why this government has introduced the ensuring integrity bill. This bill is designed to target organisations and individuals that fail to take seriously both the privileges and responsibilities arising out of registration or appointment as an officer and who continue to break the law with reckless abandon. The bill, which applies equally to all registered organisations, be they unions or employer organisations, introduces basic standards of behaviour for such organisations and their officials. It will assist in deterring repeated law breaking through the imposition of tougher penalties by the courts.</span>

If that weren't enough, just this weekend we saw reports of Mr Setka making threatening remarks about sitting senators, about colleagues in this chamber. That sort of behaviour is totally inexcusable and beyond defensible. It doesn't matter whether they're construction workers or small businesses, senators or otherwise, no-one should be forced to do anything under the threat of retribution from a militant union or its officials.</span>

They refuse to acknowledge that the problems run deeper than one man, however disgraceful his behaviours might be. They refuse to drop their policy to scrap the ABCC, something they committed to because they promised the CFMMEU even less oversight. They're engaging in a protection racket of repeat law-breakers in unions, like the CFMMEU, who continue to give the rest of the union movement a bad name. It leads you to wonder: why would those opposite be doing that? Is it because they support law breaking? Is it because they have personal links that they can't get past or is it because they receive millions of dollars from the coffers of law-breaking organisations like the CFMMEU into their accounts every single year? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This question that the Labor Party is asking here should actually be ruled out of order because, quite frankly, this is just part of Labor Party trickery. As I said last week, you're still going through your seven stages of grief. You still haven't accepted that you lost the last election. You still haven't accepted that you lost the seat of Chisholm, and you thought you already had it in your bag.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You are accusing Ms Liu of being part of organisations that your Labor candidate was a member of. On the weekend we had this amazing attempt at a diversion by the Leader of the Opposition, who said, 'Oh, that shouldn't really matter, because the Labor candidate was Taiwanese.' We are not actually accusing anyone of having done anything wrong by being part of these organisations. We think it's normal that Australians of Chinese origin are involved in Chinese community organisations. It's only the Labor Party that is trying to run a smear. Whatever way you want to put it, the imputation is that you are trying to get the message to the Australian people that the Labor Party thinks that Ms Liu is a spy. That is the accusation that you are running.</span>

This is a government that is committed to getting people off of welfare and into work. The greatest thing you can do for someone is to find them a job, and we have a very specific focus on getting our young people off welfare and into work. We have the Youth Jobs PaTH program. This is all about prepare, trial and hire. It's focusing on giving our young people who want to work the skills that they require to actually get into the workforce. Really importantly, it's the opportunity to have a go in the workplace, because the feedback so many of these young people give us is: 'We want to get a job. However, we have not been able to get a foot in the door,' and that is exactly what the PaTH program does. But we're also giving employers the incentive to hire and to continue to invest in this particular young person.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since being introduced in 2017, the government's Youth Jobs PaTH program has helped over 50,000 young jobseekers into work. That's 50,000 young Australians who would otherwise be reliant on welfare. That is 50,000 young Australians who have the chance of a fulfilling career, something they tell us is exactly what they want. That is 50,000 young Australians who are helping to avoid the trap that is long-term unemployment. We are now going to expand the Youth Jobs PaTH program to include PaTH industry pilots. We're going to work directly with industry and give industry the direct opportunity to provide input, training, matching and support for young jobseekers. This is a government that is committed to getting our youth off welfare and into work.</span>

One such example is Janaya Paul. She's a young Indigenous woman from your great state, Senator Stoker. She's from the Gold Coast. She's landed a job as an apprentice mechanic, with the help of the government's Youth Jobs PaTH Program. She undertook employability skills training with a training specialist. The specialist, along with her jobactive provider, then helped her secure a PaTH internship with a motor mechanic on the Gold Coast. Following the internship, Janaya was offered an apprenticeship with the mechanics firm. She is now one of a growing number of female motor mechanics in Australia, and this is the message that she has for other women:</span>

On this side of the chamber, we are committed to getting people off welfare and into work. We are committed, in particular, to getting our young people off welfare and into work and giving them every opportunity that we can to get those skills that they require before they can even get a foot in the door, to give them that opportunity for internship. So many of them say to us, 'We want to put our hand up and work.' But guess what? Because they don't have that experience, they're not able to get that foot in the door. This is exactly what the PaTH program is able to do for them—give them the skills they need, give them that opportunity to undertake an internship and get that foot in the door. Then we encourage employers to take them on and invest in them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:22</span>):  My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. The Murray-Darling Basin is in crisis. The environment is in collapse. Communities are on the brink of having no clean drinking water. Family farms have their backs against the wall. And the water minister says he doesn't even believe in climate change. He says he can't do anything except pray for rain. When will the Morrison government get its head out of the sand on climate change and come to tackle the drought, rather than just praying for rain and giving communities your hopes and prayers?</span>

Not only are we on track to meet and exceed the emissions reduction targets signed on to in Kyoto, we also have a plan to meet our emissions reduction targets to 2030 agreed to in Paris. In relation to the Murray-Darling Basin, the government is committed to delivering the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, to ensure benefits flow to communities, farmers and the environment. We have achieved a lot, but we acknowledge the Basin Plan isn't perfect. Reversing the effects of the past 100 years of management will take time. The basin isn't just a source of precious water; it's our food bowl. Almost half our irrigated agriculture production comes from the basin. It is home to more than two million people and supports tens of thousands of businesses. So we are committed to effective action on climate change and we are committed to effective implementation of the Basin Plan, but we do understand that it takes time to reverse 100 years of previous decision-making.</span>

The purpose of the release is to allow additional irrigation allocations to water rights holders along the Murray River in southern New South Wales and northern Victoria. Without the water, crops currently in the ground will fail and rural communities will be adversely affected. </span>

                  </a>  Obviously, I know it's been a busy weekend for National Party MPs and senators, with our federal conference. I'm sure Minister Littleproud will be getting to the details of your letter this week. What we do support on this side of the chamber—and I'm sure all of parliament supports—is that Australian irrigators, Australian farmers, can continue to produce. It is incredibly tough out there. That is one thing we did hear at the National Party federal conference over the weekend. That is particularly so in Queensland, New South Wales and sections of Victoria. The majority of the two million Australians that live in the Murray-Darling Basin are producing the food and fibre that we export around the world. They are doing it incredibly tough because of the drought. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan is in the process of being implemented. Eighty per cent of it has been implemented thus far. There is obviously a lot of discussion around the CEWH and how some of those environmental holdings can be used, and there are a lot of different ideas around how to use that water, particularly in tough times such as the drought which we're going through. Those questions should be appropriately addressed to the Minister for the Environment, because, as you know, Senator Roberts, it is Sussan Ley, the Minister for the Environment, who has responsibility for the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. </span>

That is why our government has put $7 billion worth of measures into the communities and on the tables of farmers, and, obviously, there are a suite of loans available to our primary producers for restocking and replanting. We've got additional mental health support going into those affected communities. Right across the board, our government is taking the drought incredibly seriously. So for you to stand up and somehow say that we don't get it and we aren't standing by our farming communities is absolutely misrepresenting what the government is doing. It is why the Prime Minister made it his first order of business. It's why he stood with the premiers—Labor premiers and Liberal premiers—when he first became Prime Minister, and called the National Drought Summit: so that together we can underpin the productive capacity of our regional communities who are struggling with drought.</span>

We all know that our unpaid carers make an absolutely invaluable contribution to society. Every day, 2.7 million Australians actually care for somebody who requires a little extra help, and we believe—the Morrison government believe—that it is absolutely important that we continue to provide assistance to those carers to enable them to continue that very, very important role. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just recently, we introduced the largest reform to carer services in more than a decade. Last month we announced $493 million for 10 not-for-profit organisations to roll out a very detailed and integrated carer support network across the whole of Australia. We did this because we had a strong budget that enabled us to do it. But can I acknowledge that the Carer Gateway was actually an initiative designed by carers for carers, and I thank Carers Australia and their subsidiary organisations. I particularly thank Ara Cresswell, the CEO of Carers Australia, for the extraordinary effort that she and her team put in to work with the government to develop this proposal. It's a fundamental shift away from the crisis driven system that we've had in the past, and it's about putting prevention and intervention—and early intervention, particularly when it comes to respite care—at the very forefront of this initiative. We believe that is important that we get in there and help carers before they reach crisis point, not after the crisis has befallen them.</span>

This is an example of the Morrison government providing stability and certainty, delivering on our promises and helping Australians help themselves.</span>

Existing service delivery will overlap with the new services to ensure continuity and a smooth transition to the new, improved services. As I said, this new model is a model that was designed by carers for carers. We want to make sure our unpaid carers can be assured that they will be able to continue to access the kind of support that they have in their local area. But we also want to make sure that they will be able to get not only that support but also, in most instances, better support. Service providers are required to ensure that unpaid carers will receive at least like-for-like services, and probably improved services, in their local area.</span>

We understand the importance of accessing respite care, because we understand that people do need a break. That's why we have invested almost $500 million in these reforms that, as I said, will deliver a fivefold increase in the kind of support that is able to be provided to our carers. This investment includes an $84.3 million investment in the 2019-20 budget to increase respite service for carers and to provide more support, particularly for young carers. The funding provides for additional complementary, short-term and emergency respite for carers, because we recognise the interdependency between the needs of carers and the needs of the people who care for them. We understand that only a strong, responsible budget will deliver this for our unpaid carers, and we will provide the certainty and stability to enable unpaid carers to continue their valuable work.</span>

The Prime Minister has made it very clear that he has full confidence in the member for Chisholm—as did the majority of voters in the seat of Chisholm, which is, of course, what this is all about. The Labor Party thinks this is somehow a backdoor way to turn back the verdict of the Australian people at the last election. That is what this is all about.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The core accusation that Labor levelled at Ms Liu was being a member of an organisation, or a number of organisations, that the Labor candidate was a member of too. Do you think that the Labor Party would be asking these questions if the Labor candidate had prevailed at the last election? Of course not. This is a transparent, politically opportunist attack. The implication of what Labor is suggesting—everybody knows what the imputation is that you're trying to get up without actually saying so. That is why I say you are guilty of a disgraceful exercise in dog whistling; you know precisely what you're doing. There are many on the Labor side that are embarrassed by the judgements that the leadership of the Labor Party has made in relation to this.</span>

                  </a>  No, actually it wasn't. Please read Senator McCarthy's actual Senate inquiry into the issue. The Liberal-National government knows the importance of the ABC to rural and regional communities. It provides local voices, talking about local issues. It covers the good, like thrilling local sporting derbies; the bad—the stresses that local communities are under because of the drought; and the downright ugly, broadcasting our emergency service information to keep locals informed and safe in bushfires and in floods, as they're currently doing. That's why it's so important that regional Australia has a say in how the ABC is run, because decisions made by a city-centric board and management centre mean that services end up getting cut to the very people for whom the ABC is often the only provider of entertainment, information and current affairs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why our government is seeking to legislate changes to ensure the ABC is responsive to the needs of rural and regional Australia: amending the charter to include regional and geographic diversity; establishing an advisory council so that the ABC board, before it makes decisions that impact on service provision, actually bothers to consult those impacted, because we know they haven't in the past; annual reporting obligations; and ensuring the ABC board itself has connections into regional Australia.</span>

It's important to have a metric (1) to make sure that changes are implemented in a timely way, and (2) to make sure rural and regional voices are heard and listened to in ABC management decisions. The bill will introduce a number of additional annual reporting obligations to the ABC, because I find that if you are actually going to have to report something publicly it will help you focus the mind on the impact of your decisions. The ABC will have to provide statistics on the number of people employed in regional and metropolitan areas. These will include details on the number of journalists employed in regional areas as well as the total number of hours of local or regional news bulletins broadcast each year. This is incredibly important for transparency. The ABC is an important news and entertainment service to our community, and we want to make sure that continues.</span>

Home Affairs Minister Dutton told 2GB radio last week that Nades, the father of the family from Biloela that your government is currently detaining on Christmas Island, had travelled internationally from Australia while his matter was still before the courts. Minister, can you confirm that, in fact, Nades did not travel from Australia while his matter was before the courts and that, anyway, under his visa conditions he would not have been allowed to return to Australia if, in fact, he had left?</span>

In relation to those details, Senator McKim, I will need to take them on notice and revert to you. But in relation to this more broadly, Senator McKim, the only reason these people, as you know, are actually in this particular situation is because of the policies that you supported the last time the Labor Party were in power. This is all about a failure to protect our borders, and the situation which is currently playing out is a direct result of a policy failure by the former Labor government in conjunction with and supported by the Australian Greens.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has made it abundantly clear in relation to this particular family's case. It has been comprehensively assessed over many, many years. You will have heard the minister say, 'They have gone on to appeal to the federal magistrates court, the Federal Court and the High Court.' The highest court in our land has found against these people. They have, every single step of the way, explained their circumstances to every decision-maker and judge, and every single one of them—every single one of them, Mr President—has rejected their claim for protection. Even though the Australian Greens do not like this, what that means is that they are not refugees.</span>

Senator McKim, I completely reject the premise of your question. The minister, along with the Prime Minister, are possibly the toughest ministers when it comes to border protection this country has ever seen. Senator McKim, your party's policy to support the Australian Labor Party the last time that they were in power led to in excess of 50,000 people coming here illegally by boat. It led to, quite alarmingly, 1,200 people that we know of perishing at sea. They also, if you recall, despite the high moral ground that they like to take, had no problem in seeing children locked up in detention. This is a direct consequence of a failure to protect Australia's borders.</span>

Analysis from JPMorgan shows that, under the Morrison government's energy crisis, power prices continue to go up and up and up. Can the minister confirm that electricity prices have risen across the four national electricity market states of Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland up to $83 per megawatt hour in August, up 12 per cent from June, despite lower demand?</span>

Our government has been working across a range of fronts to ensure that energy prices are contained and come down. What we've seen is that there are emerging signs in some quarters of price relief in terms of consumers being able to access lower energy prices. Consumers, of course, who find themselves on default plans now find that, without question, they are in a position to enjoy better deals as a result of the reforms that this government has put in place. The reforms we've put in place in relation to the gouging that has occurred in terms of the gold plating of infrastructure and the like are, again, about keeping prices as low as possible into the future. These reforms across the board, whether they relate of to retail, generation or transmission—</span>

The actions we've taken—whether it's generation reforms to encourage new generation to put stability into the grid in terms of both generation and prices, to reform transmission, to change market rules and to stop gouging we've seen in transmission or, in particular, the retail reforms that ensure Australians don't get pushed onto default contracts that are unfair and that take advantage of those who are most vulnerable—are benefitting Australians and will continue to provide price relief in terms of the type of increases experienced in the past not being repeated again in the future.</span>

Under consideration are a number of options, including referral to the Privileges Committee, referral to the police, or inviting Mr Setka to appear before the Education and Employment Committee to explain his remarks. It will likely be a combination of these things. There should be zero tolerance for anyone who seeks to influence a senator's vote by way of threat.

To seek to influence a vote in this chamber by threat or intimidation is completely inappropriate. I dish it out myself a fair bit in this place, so I cannot be complaining when it comes back in my direction, but the comments attributed to Mr Setka in recent reports are entirely beyond the pale. Politics can be brutal but it should never become violent. We are closely examining what options are available to us to ensure that this kind of intimidation gets the response it rightfully deserves. My vote will never be determined by who bullies me the most. I won't be swayed by threats or the people who make them. But allowing these threats to go unanswered is no longer an option. I won't be saying anything further on the matter until we have determined the most appropriate course of action.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has two responsibilities that sit above everything else. The first is to provide national prosperity—and we all know that he is failing miserably at this—but today we have also seen that he is failing at the second, and that second duty is his duty to provide national security. It is his duty as Prime Minister to ensure that all Australians are safe. How can you be the government of the day and ignore the advice of our national security agencies? It's irresponsible at best, dangerous at worst.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite are scrambling so fast to contain this that they are now playing one of the lowest cards one can play in public life, and that is the race card. But, actually, the last refuge of the scoundrel is proving to be the Liberal-National party room, because the only person linking these specific and serious concerns about Ms Liu to the entire Chinese-Australian population is the Prime Minister, and he should stop. National security agencies do not make decisions nor do they give advice because they're racist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to a recent speech by the outgoing Director-General of ASIO, Duncan Lewis. Mr Lewis warned in that speech that foreign interference and espionage are proving to be an existential threat to our country. What he said was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It’s my view that currently, the issue of espionage and foreign interference is by far and away the most serious issue going forward. Covert attempts to influence and shape the views of the public, media, government and diaspora communities, both within Australia and overseas, is now with us every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Unlike the immediacy of terrorism incidents, the harm from acts of espionage may not present for years, even decades, after the activity has occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These sorts of activities are typically quiet and insidious, with a long tail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He then went on to talk about the existential threat that they pose to the nation, noting that part of the danger was that it was more subtle and difficult to recognise than the threat of terrorism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABC has reported that the office of former Prime Minister Turnbull received advice from ASIO Director-General Duncan Lewis, as he then was, that Mr Turnbull should not attend a meet and greet organised by Ms Liu following vetting of the guest list by ASIO. That is from one of our security agencies. There is no racism in what ASIO and its sister agencies do or in the work and advice that they give.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Prime Minister's test, the question is: is Mr Lewis a racist? That is the question, and of course he is not. Need I remind this place who voted on a motion to say, 'It's okay to be white' or who lined up to congratulate former Senator Anning after he invoked the 'final solution' when talking about immigration policy. The Prime Minister loves to remind us all that the Liberal Party is the party of Menzies, but we're not buying what the Prime Minister is selling. Robert Menzies would be turning in his grave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This whole sordid affair has come about because of the Liberal Party's quite unbelievable decision to preselect Ms Liu, knowing full well the concerns that existed around her associations. As a Victorian Liberal MP said to me rather gloomily late last week, she was preselected with everyone hoping she wouldn't win because then she'd be done and would never be able to run again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gladys Liu is not a new player on the political scene. She's been an active member of the Victorian Liberal Party for many years. She is notorious for raising enormous amounts of money but she is also notorious for being a loose cannon. She has a questionable work history, has brought vast, unexplained wealth to the Liberal Party and comes to this place with more baggage than Louis Vuitton—just ask her Victorian colleagues. She's a money machine. She's the LNP's own personal ATM from Whitehorse Road and that's why she sits in this place. That's why she was preselected. Because, let's face it, it's clearly not due to her strong media performances. Ms Liu's Victorian colleagues should be sharing what they know about Ms Liu with the Prime Minister, because the truth is: you don't know what you don't know and you should be very, very careful.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  I rise to take note of the matters raised by Senator Kitching, and it is with some amusement. I accept that 'amusement' is a strange word to use in the circumstances, because security is such an important subject, and yet here we are with almost every question being raised by the opposition in question time dealing with the slurs against Ms Liu in circumstances where the emperor really doesn't have any clothes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need only look to some of the coverage that this issue has received over the last few days to get a sense of just how empty the Labor Party's approach is at the moment. They don't have any substance on the economy, so they want to talk about this. They don't have any substance when it comes to climate policy; they're divided and confused. Some of them want to keep a 45 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030—that's Ms Plibersek. Others, like Mr Conroy, want to change and go to a 2050 net zero pollution target. Mr Butler wants to ditch the 45 per cent target, but in favour of what? Who knows! Mr Fitzgibbon says, 'We need to talk about the elephant in the room—our dud policy on climate, but nobody really knows what to replace it with. If we can just talk about Ms Liu enough, maybe no-one will notice that we're saying, "Look, a unicorn!" and asking people to look in the other direction.' Because the truth is: they've got nothing in the cupboard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes without saying that we are doing the heavy lifting on these difficult issues—getting the balance right between our need for economic development and our need for environmental protection. We are getting on with the job in a no-nonsense, no-grandstanding kind of way—exceeding Kyoto targets, meeting our Paris commitments, and doing it all with a growing economy rather than devastating it, like Labor's 45 per cent emissions reduction target would have done. But all of this goes to the heart of the matter, and that is: Labor have got nothing to offer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're the same on the economy, too. They don't know what they want. Do they still want a high-tax, high-spend agenda, or are they going to listen to the Australians who said, 'That just isn't the way we work'? Well, at the moment, they don't know. So, again, they point to the unicorn over there—'Quick! Look over there!'—because they've got nothing to offer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Liu is a first-term MP. I've only been in this place a short period of time, and I know how nerve-racking it can be to be a new person in this place and to do media interviews. It can be a tough thing to do. She gave a clumsy interview, but they are tricky things to do. But let's not pretend, even for a second, that that means anything like what the circumstances of former Senator Dastyari looked like. That was a wildly, wildly different situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the facts here. Ms Liu is a woman of Chinese heritage, born in Hong Kong. She came here with just two suitcases and has started a life for herself. She's overcome disability. She's overcome domestic violence. She's overcome so many of the barriers that people from different races in this country face as they try and be heard in the public square. Yet she has done it, and she has made it all the way to the parliament of Australia in what is really a milestone. She's run a small business. She's come here to get an education. She's created something beautiful for her and her family. And you know what? That speaks to the stories of the 1.2 million Australians of Chinese heritage who have made their home here—who do it with a loyalty to Australia, who do it understanding where they've come from and acknowledging that culture, and who are often involved in organisations that reflect their connection to that culture but with their heart here in Australia. That's one of the really exciting things about a multicultural Australia—something that shouldn't be turned into a cheap shot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very different to anything that could be compared to Mr Dastyari's situation: she hasn't got anyone to pay her personal expenses—she hasn't got foreign nationals to do that; she hasn't changed her position on issues, doing the bidding of people from another nation; and she hasn't done it using the crest of this place. No—she's a Hong Kong-born Australian, doing her best to represent the people of Chisholm to the best of her ability in this place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  Every day, there are new questions raised about the member for Chisholm's affiliations in the past, her actions, her work history and the donations that she solicited for the Victorian Liberal Party. Every day, the government ducks and weaves away from all of these questions. Every day, those opposite try to evade responsibility for what's going on with the member for Chisholm, what the Prime Minister knew and when.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We call on the Prime Minister and Gladys Liu to come clean on the donations facilitated by her, by her own account—which were, as she claims, 'very substantial'—and we call on her and the Prime Minister to come clean about her past affiliations. The best place for the member for Chisholm to do that is in the parliament. It certainly didn't go very well on Sky the other night. The interview on Sky the other night wasn't the clumsy interview of a first-term backbencher—I've done a few of those myself recently. When asked questions about what organisations she's been a member of, she did not tell the truth. When she was asked questions about what the Australian position should be in relation to the South China Sea, she refused to commit herself to a position. It's not clumsy; it's far worse than that. She should make a full and complete statement about what's happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are strong indications from the material that is now in the public domain that the Prime Minister put winning a marginal seat and internal Victorian factional considerations ahead of Australia's national security. The Prime Minister's response is to smear all those who want answers about the affiliations and the donations swirling around the member for Chisholm, with a disgraceful allegation that the questions are motivated by racist antipathy towards the Chinese community or opportunism. The counterfactual is that nobody should ever ask questions about the member for Chisholm, and I don't think that's acceptable in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side, we take national security seriously along with our obligations to uphold the duties of parliamentarians to stand up unequivocally for the national interest. This week, again—like last week—there are no plans for the government to deal with the economic challenges that face the country: no economic policy, no energy policy and no climate change policy. The catalogue of zero government policy is seemingly endless, and there are real clouds over the integrity of the Prime Minister, who said on Friday that he had never used the term 'Shanghai Sam' in relation to the conduct of former Senator Dastyari. He did use that term, with all of its dog-whistling connotations, 17 times, including four times in a single sentence, which is a remarkable thing to achieve. At the time he was making it, the Prime Minister thought that the smear against former Senator Dastyari was a real hit. All of the blustering, bullying, bloviating boy from Bondi's behaviour was on full view—all there for everybody to see. Not so much now, it seems!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there are any sensible people left on the other side of the parliament, they should give the Prime Minister a bit of advice: if your only defence of the indefensible is to smear your opponents then you'd better come to the debate with clean hands. The Prime Minister's hands are filthy. We have a Prime Minister who is failing when it comes to integrity. The only person in this conversation who is trying to pretend that what is going on around Gladys Liu is about an entire community is the Prime Minister. We know that, because he's running the paid ads on WeChat already. It's offensive, it's absurd, it's opportunist and, unfortunately for the Prime Minister, it is true to form. All we are asking for and all the community is asking for is an assurance from the Prime Minister that Ms Liu is a fit and proper person to stand in the Australian parliament and that he hasn't put winning a marginal seat and putrid Victorian factional politics ahead of Australia's national security. The member for Chisholm should rise in the parliament, in the House of Representatives, this afternoon and make a full account of these matters. She should do it this afternoon and she should do it without delay.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:20</span>):  I rise in the debate to take note of the answers to various questions. Senator Ayres, I had some hope when you asked your question; you actually asked a policy question in this place—a policy question! It's been so long since we've heard a policy question from those opposite. It was such a relief, but now, in the taking note debate, we get to the point where we're back to the same old, inside the Beltway, politics for the sake of politics from the Labor Party that we've seen so often. Labor have form in this area. I find it almost extraordinary that they are the ones who want to bring up Sam Dastyari. We heard from Senator Cormann earlier; we heard about some of the exploits of that particular individual in the past and some of the activities that he was involved in that led to his eventual departure from this place. It is quite extraordinary for the Labor Party, who have got such form in this area, to be running these sorts of lines—this attack on a single coalition member of parliament—to muddy the waters on their own pretty shabby dealings. We've all heard Labor's new policy to ban plastic bags—it's not an environmental policy; it's a donation policy. The Labor Party have got a track record of using these sorts of thinly veiled xenophobic attacks against those they don't like.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about the Adani coalmine, the member for Sydney said: 'You cannot rely on an Indian mining company to bring jobs to Central and North Queensland.' We all remember Michael Daley's claims about Asians with PhDs taking jobs. We all remember Luke Foley talking about 'white flight'. And we all remember the union campaigns against the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. We remember the paid advertisement on TV featuring—well, let's say a Caucasian family, the mum folding the laundry, talking about the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. This is pretty thin, pretty sad stuff from the labour movement and from the Australian Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Chisholm addressed some of these potential happenings in her first speech, in fact. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I do not underestimate the enormity of being the first Chinese-born member of this place. I know some people will see everything I do through the lens of my birthplace, but I hope that they will see more than just the first Chinese woman elected to this place. I hope they will see me as a strong advocate for everyone in Chisholm. Chisholm is where my heart is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Senator Cormann really belled the cat when he talked about the fact that the Labor candidate for Chisholm was a member of many of the same organisations that are currently the cause for the attack on the current member for Chisholm. It really does call out those opposite for their lack of focus on policy, for their desire to attack a single coalition backbencher, a backbencher who gave a clumsy interview—I think that is the best word for it. All of us, early in our careers, have perhaps given interviews where we haven't quite got the words out correctly. I think we can all very much feel for that. But Ms Liu has made it very clear in subsequent statements, including statements to parliament, that she did choose her words poorly during that interview and that, on the declarations matter, she has complied with all relevant state and federal disclosure laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on those opposite to really consider what they're doing with this current attack on a single member of parliament. It is not a particularly edifying example of the way this chamber or this parliament should behave, and I certainly would ask all members opposite to reflect on that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281603" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator </span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">MARIELLE </span>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">SMITH</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  I also rise to take note of the answers given to questions asked by Senators Wong, Gallagher, Keneally and Kitching today. And while members of the government have dismissed the saga surrounding the member for Chisholm as that of a conspiracy theory, senators on this side believe it is time that the inconsistencies that we keep getting are addressed head-on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As members and senators of parliament, elected to this place by the Australian people, we hold a unique responsibility to the people that we represent. It is a responsibility of trust and transparency in the work that we undertake. It is a heavy responsibility held by all of us, none more nor less than any other, because all of us are required to make decisions that are in the best interests of our communities, our states and our country—most of all when these decisions include overseas or foreign influences. When inconsistencies regarding these matters emerge, it is fair for questions to be asked that seek clarification and explanation. That is all that my colleagues on this side of the chamber sought to do in question time today, and the suggestion that their questions have been motivated by anything other than that, I have to say, is deeply offensive and just ridiculous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the past few weeks we have heard, seen and read successive reports in the media, in the Senate and in the other place regarding the member for Chisholm. It has been well canvassed that on Tuesday night the member for Chisholm agreed to an interview with Andrew Bolt in an effort to clear her name on these issues. It's probably not the program that I would have chosen to go on but it was the program that she went on. I sympathise, as someone new to this profession, and as some of my colleagues have also said today, that early interviews can be quite challenging. But this wasn't just first interview nerves and it was more than a clumsy interview. It was a train wreck, because, during this interview, the member for Chisholm raised more questions in every answer that she gave. Indeed, the member for Chisholm couldn't explain her association with numerous organisations of concern, and on three occasions during the interview she failed to commit herself to the bipartisan position on the South China Sea. This is more than 'clumsy', and the Prime Minister and the government surely know it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But you would not think so, because in question time on Wednesday last week the Prime Minister refused to assure Australians that the member for Chisholm was a fit and proper person to sit in the Australian parliament. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne, in Senate question time last Wednesday, refused to assure Australians that the member for Chisholm is a fit and proper person to sit in the Australian parliament. And today we have heard continuing refusals from Senator Cormann to assure Australians that the member for Chisholm is a fit and proper person to serve in the Australian parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Thursday last week, there were extraordinary reports that senior Liberals were warned by security agencies regarding concerns about the member for Chisholm and her links to the Chinese Communist Party. As Senator Keneally reminded Senator Cormann in a question today, one government MP is quoted as saying, 'There should have been concerns when she was being chosen to stand as a candidate, and I believe those concerns were ignored.' This raises very serious questions as to whether the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party put winning marginal seats ahead of Australia's national security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this goes far beyond a clumsy interview; it goes to questions regarding the national interest. The Prime Minister needs to demonstrate to the Australian people what steps he took to ensure the member for Chisholm was a fit and proper person to sit in the Australian parliament. He should explain what he knew about these reports and when he knew it. It's time for answers, not more inconsistency from a saga that has been riddled with inconsistency after inconsistency. Because our responsibilities here as members of parliament and as representatives of the Australian people are rightly heavy responsibilities, Australians need to know that these responsibilities are being met, and the member for Chisholm has a responsibility to address the inconsistencies that keep rolling in, including to the other questions raised today about the double-checking process that she is reportedly going through. She should do that by making a full and complete statement in the Australian parliament. Again, this is about inconsistencies. Questions have been asked; they need to be addressed. It's time for answers from the member for Chisholm and from the Prime Minister. It's time for the inconsistencies to be cleared up.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Hanson-Young today relating to water resources in the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this is a river system that is in absolute crisis, an environmental collapse looming once more; we know that farms and farming communities have their backs against the wall; and now we understand that communities throughout the basin are struggling even to be able to turn on the tap and get clean drinking water. This is a disaster, an absolute crisis, and it has happened on the watch of the National Party while they have had the water portfolio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, the coalition government, has for six years mismanaged the Murray-Darling Basin. They have mismanaged the country's most precious water resource. They've prioritised the profits of big corporate irrigators, particularly those up in the north, and they've prioritised those who continue to fund electoral and political donations to the National Party. Meanwhile, small family farmers go without, communities are now struggling even to access basic clean water and the environment is teetering on the brink of collapse. It is a disaster, and it's happened on the watch of the National Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do we hear from the Minister for Water Resources, Drought, Rural Finance, Natural Disaster and Emergency Management? Only last week Mr David Littleproud, the water minister and a Nationals member at the cabinet table, said he wasn't even sure if climate change was man-made. Let's not forget that not only is Mr Littleproud in charge of the nation's water policy and the management of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan but he's also in charge of responding to natural disasters. He's in charge of drought policy in this country, and the bloke doesn't even believe in climate change or the science that underpins any way of dealing with this going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what's going on in the Murray-Darling Basin right now: it is a mess created by the National Party, with their lack of understanding about climate change, their backing of big corporate irrigators over everybody else and their insistence that their head-in-the-sand approach on coal and carbon pollution in this country will have no impact on the drought or on the climate in the future. Do you know what's killing the Murray-Darling Basin right now? Cotton, coal and climate change. They're what's killing the Murray-Darling Basin. That's why we have farmers with their backs against the wall—because the government are in denial. They've done nothing. It's time they got a real drought policy that takes into consideration what they need to do on climate change and time they started reining in the overextraction of our water supply by big corporate interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, many of these corporate interests, let's not forget, are big foreign agricultural companies that have no care for the local communities in which they operate. Their profits go overseas. The people who run these places don't even live in the areas from which they're draining water. And then we have the water barons who have now come into the market. The price spikes now are so high that everyday users in the system, small family farms, can't even afford their water licences. They can't afford the water for their stock or to water their crops. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what do we get from this minister? We get: 'You know what? Not my fault, but, everyone, if we just pray for rain, hopefully, the system will get better. Hopefully, the problem will be solved.' We need a whole lot more than hopes and prayers to fix the Murray-Darling Basin. We need a properly managed system, a drought policy that takes into consideration climate change and a minister that is not up to his neck in doing the deeds for big corporate irrigators and their political donations. That's what we need. The sooner the National Party are forced to hand over the water portfolio, the sooner we can get on with fixing our river system for good.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The bill repeals the ANL Act 1956 and ANL Guarantee Act 1994 to remove impediments to businesses using protected names and also removes unnecessary and outdated legislation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Provisions in the largely defunct ANL Act 1956 relating to protected business names are unintentionally preventing a small number of maritime businesses from registering or re-registering trademarks and websites. Retention of the protected name provisions appears to be a historical oversight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Several permissions and interim arrangements which have allowed these businesses to operate under the protected names are due to expire from late 2019. A range of pending applications cannot be approved until impediments in the ANL Act 1956 are addressed. Failure to remove these impediments is likely to have substantial negative financial and operational impacts on these businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Repeal of the ANL Act 1956 and the ANL Guarantee Act 1994 is appropriate as the remaining provisions have ceased to have legal or practical effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Passage of the bill in 2019 is required to remove protected name provisions impeding businesses as soon as possible, and to implement a permanent solution that will provide ongoing operational certainty and support confidence in investment.</span>

There are strict safety and environmental standards overseen by an independent expert regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, otherwise known as NOPSEMA, which takes into account publicly available research findings in its decisions. A large body of international and Australian scientific research shows that, when properly managed, seismic surveys can be conducted safely. A three-year research program by the Australian Institute of Marine Science is currently underway to further understand the impacts on fish, invertebrates and plankton.</span>

                  </a>  Australia have the highest per capita investment in renewable energy in the world. The government is addressing climate change, but won't sell out jobs and industry to do so. The coal industry provides real jobs and was Australia's largest export earner last year. Resources and energy exports earned Australia $279 billion last year. The taxes, royalties and income generated by Australia's coal, oil and gas industries enable new investments in education, roads and hospitals, providing jobs and opportunities for all Australians. Fossil fuel workers shouldn't be forced to transition into new jobs. Instead, they should be recognised for the hard work they do for our nation.</span>

In light of your ruling that you didn't hear an affirmative to grant leave, I'd appeal to you that that's an inappropriate ruling, because when you said, 'Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted,' no-one objected to granting me leave, so I should have been entitled to make a statement relating to the factual accuracy of the Greens' motion.</span>

I really want to put on the record about the motion by the Greens, whilst they were trying to be clever about the Earth being round and the moon-landing and so forth in relation to climate change, that I really didn't recognise that they worshipped and were so desperate to align themselves with the Northern Hemisphere, including the Trump presidency, by changing the date in Australia of when man landed on the moon.

You are senators in the Australian parliament. You are not part of the Donald Trump or the Kennedy or the Clinton administration, no matter how much you'd like to be. So, please, stick to the facts, get your motions accurate in this place and then maybe, just maybe, there will be less cynicism about the Greens and your motions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator ROBERTS:</span>
                </a>  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I know that some constituents spend many, many years and many tens of thousands of dollars—well over $100,000—seeking custody through parenting orders from the Family Court. Yet, when they leave the court, the other party breaches those orders and withholds access to those precious children. That's shared care through shared costs for care, yet one party is forcing the other party to pay huge legal fees and child support costs while denying access. Worse, if the court orders fifty-fifty custody but one parent withholds access, that party can truthfully say they have 100 per cent custody, despite breaching court orders, and the child support system will force the other parent to pay more accordingly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The child support system, as it stands, rewards parents financially for breaking court orders. Even worse, the child support system can deem a parent to pay more than their actual income because of the 'capacity to earn' clause. For example, if a parent on a fly-in fly-out contract with a mining site is earning $150,000 or more and that contract ends and he finds another job at a lower pay, he is deemed to be capable of earning $150,000, and child support payments are levied at a higher rate. That parent loses his access to his kids, loses huge amounts of money and, when forced to sell assets to pay for child support, spirals downward. That parent's mental health deteriorates. He finds it difficult to keep his job and, above all, he can't see his children because the other parent is breaching court orders with impunity. Restricting a parent's access to their children and forcing them to pay more than they can is abusive. It is a form of emotional violence that can lead to suicide, and it is the children who suffer more. For the sake of the parents and especially the children, we must fix this.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to point out that it is not this alone that is hurting parents and especially children. It is the interaction and the confusion that requires children sometimes to become a weapon and, in so doing, a casualty. It is the children who get hurt. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In the family law system, there is a lack of consequences for people who tell lies and make false claims. They don't have to fess up. There's the interaction of state and federal laws; this is very confusing for people to wind themselves through. There is custody of the child and access to the child, of course. There are domestic violence claims which sometimes are false. There is the property settlement issue. There is abuse of the law. There is legal game playing. Then there is money-grabbing by lawyers and money-grabbing by some parents. And there is an emotional issue for everyone. There are long-term consequences and there are many more people affected than just the two parents and the children; there are grandparents and communities. So this is not a simple issue. We have raised it, and we thank the Senate for its support to speak about it today. It is an issue that must be tackled, starting with child custody, especially in the Family Court. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give people an idea of just how deeply damaging this can be. I had a tour recently of the Australian Brotherhood of Fathers facilities, an entirely voluntary operation in Southport, Queensland, south of Brisbane. Leith Erikson himself, the founder, gave me the tour and gave a number of our staff a tour. Leith told us about the start of the Australian Brotherhood of Fathers, or its predecessor. He used to turn up at courts to help men and women, mothers and fathers, through the court procedure. He realised there was a big gap in the services provided to people and then started helping people in various aspects. He now has a building that has a call centre manned entirely by volunteers. What's more, it is manned by people who have been through the process, so they understand. These are not consultants, these are not telemarketers and these are not call centre people; these are people who have been through the mill of the destructive family law court system and child custody services system. Leith has people there manning the phones for people to call in and get advice on how to approach situations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Brotherhood of Fathers—which also helps mothers; it's gender neutral—also has a facility for supervised child contact. That means that people who have to have supervised contact can get access to these very safe facilities at a much lower cost than is standard. That's yet another cost that some parents have to fork out: paying for someone to watch them having an interaction with their own kids. There are facilities for older people. There are counsellors who are given space in that centre for counselling. There are other facilities there that complete the gamut. There are legal services there that enable people to access lawyers at a fair rate, knowing that those lawyers are going to be on their side and not just in it for the money.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very, very complex thing. Lives have been ruined by this. I'm so pleased to see that the Senate can see this and support this matter of urgency today. Acting Deputy President, I have no more to say other than thank you. Our thoughts go to all mothers, fathers and grandparents who are going through this very difficult time.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="264449" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  The Morrison government is committed to keeping all Australians safe and secure. That is why the government has taken action to improve Australia's family law system to protect Australians from family and domestic violence and to significantly increase mental health funding to support our families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government recognises that family and relationship breakdowns can be amongst the most stressful and difficult circumstances in people's lives, for both adults and children. This government is committed to ongoing improvements to the family law system to ensure that the system helps families separate in a safe, supportive and timely way. The Morrison government has already committed to delivering structural reform of the federal family law courts to help end the unnecessary costs and delays for thousands of Australian families that arise from a split federal Family Court system. This will allow families to have their matters dealt with as efficiently as possible and under a single set of rules and procedures. These reforms will significantly improve the family law system by reducing the backlog of matters before the family law courts and driving timely, less expensive and more consistent resolution of disputes for Australian families. It is estimated that these structural reforms have the potential in time to allow thousands of additional cases to be resolved each and every year. It will create, in effect, a single point of entry into the family law jurisdiction of the Federal Court system and ensure a consistent pathway for Australian families in having their family law disputes dealt with in the federal courts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison coalition government also commissioned the first comprehensive review of the family law system in 40 years. That review, the results of which were released in April this year, contains 60 recommendations to improve our family law system. The government is carefully considering the Australian Law Reform Commission's wide-ranging review of the family law system. We are intent on ensuring the system works for Australian families, keeps them safe and, as I've said, allows for efficient and timely separations of families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment to improvements to the family law system is clear from the range of significant measures the government have already taken to assist and protect separating families. That includes the establishment and now extension of specialist domestic violence units and health justice partnerships, which provide legal and social support assistance to vulnerable women experiencing family violence. We have established and are extending the Family Advocacy and Support Service, which provides duty lawyers at family law courts to provide services to families affected by family violence. In the 2019-20 budget, we committed an additional $7.8 million over three years for dedicated men's support workers to be engaged in all FASS locations. The dedicated men's support workers will provide access to support services for both alleged perpetrators and male victims of family violence—and I think it's great to see us taking a gender neutral approach to this issue.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also committed $50 million over four years for family law property mediation as part of the Women's Economic Security Package, a package introduced by this government that I am firmly supportive of. There's $11 million to improve information sharing between the family law, family violence and child protection services, including the co-location of state and territory family safety officials in family law courts and prohibiting perpetrators of family violence from cross-examining their victims in family law proceedings. We're providing $7 million to legal aid commissions to represent affected parties as well as more than $10 million over four years for the family law courts to employ up to 17 additional qualified social workers and psychologists as family consultants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">These recent measures are on top of the $160 million per year for family law services to support people from family law disputes outside of court. These services include counselling and education programs, and it's estimated that more than 70,000 men and 86,000 women accessed these services last year. As well as this, the government provides legal assistance funding, which will increase to around $370 million per year from 2021, as part of the national Single Mechanism announced by the government in the 2019-20 budget.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, the Women's Economic Security Package is a really important element of how we're supporting this family law area, and we've provided $50 million over four years for family law property mediation. Providing mediation services will support families to reach agreements about their property splits between themselves, which will keep these families out of court. I think that's a really important point to make here. This measure is expected to provide an additional 31,200 couples across Australia with access to affordable property mediation each year. The government will also provide $10.3 million for legal aid commissions to run a two-year trial of lawyer-assisted mediation in each state and territory.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said earlier, it's really important that we not only focus on how we can make our Family Court system easier to navigate by people seeking to use it but also aim to keep as many of these disputes out of the court system as possible. If we can help these families settle their family law disputes outside the court system, I think that is only ever seen as a good outcome for Australian families going through this difficult process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also introduced a child support scheme which is designed to ensure parents take responsibility for the financial care of their children in line with their financial capacity to do so. The Child Support Scheme exists to assess and collect child support payments for the benefit of children of separated parents. Overall, this system will be providing services to 1.3 million separated parents and transfers approximately $3½ billion as of 30 June 2018 in financial support for approximately 1.1 million children. There has been substantial work undertaken to improve this system, and the government recently agreed to 18 of the 25 recommendations from the House of Representatives standing committee inquiry into the child support program. Of these recommendations, 12 have been implemented to date, and that reflects real improvements made to this system. As is always the case, we understand that there is more work to do in this area. We are continuing to implement the other recommendations out of that House of Representatives committee review.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The department delivers a range of services and programs under the Families and Children Activity, many with an early intervention and prevention focus. Left unaddressed, persistent disadvantage in childhood, as we know, has significant and long-lasting impacts on individuals, families and communities. That is why the Morrison government takes this issue so seriously. There is clear and persuasive evidence that prevention and early intervention to support positive child and family outcomes is more effective, and indeed more cost effective, than remedial responses. Services funded under the Families and Children Activity include universal and soft-entry services such as community playgroups and early childhood education programs, as well as more intensive programs such as counselling and relationship services for families at risk of breakdown and home visiting services that provide intensive parenting education and support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's paramount concern is the safety and wellbeing of children. With this in mind, our priority is to support children to remain safely with their family and their community through prevention and early intervention measures. The National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children was developed with state and territory governments and the non-government sector to ensure children and young people are safe and well. The first three action plans under the national framework delivered many key achievements, including the appointment of the National Children's Commissioner, the development of the National Standards for Out-of-Home Care and the delivery of projects to improve service responses for families and promote better understanding of child wellbeing. The fourth action plan under this national framework for protecting Australia's children has a strong focus on early intervention and improved outcomes for children in out-of-home care and organisational settings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, all Australian governments agree that children have the right to grow up in a family that is loving, stable and safe, but we recognise that sometimes this isn't always the case, that incredibly sad things do happen to families and they are required to separate. That's why we, as a government, are focusing not only on preventing that from happening wherever we can but, in the sad instance that it does occur, ensuring that families are appropriately supported through the family law system generally and provided with services to mediate these separations outside of the court system. We are also, of course, enhancing the Family Court system and ensuring that it's easy to navigate and timely in addressing family separations. I'm certainly confident our commitment to ongoing improvements to the family law system and support for programs with a focus on early intervention and prevention will improve outcomes for our Australian children.</span>

                <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I just wanted to take issue with one point Senator Chandler raised, and that's about applauding the gender-neutral language when it comes to domestic violence on that side of the chamber. I'd be very cautious about that because what we know from the facts is that the victims of domestic violence aren't gender neutral. Females are overwhelmingly the victims of domestic violence. So, if you want to be politically correct, don't pick that issue to be politically correct on. What we know are the facts, and the facts are that it is women who are, unfortunately, the majority of the victims of domestic violence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this issue that Senator Roberts raised is an important one, but it's a classic with Senator Roberts that he always focuses in on a couple of issues or a couple of people that suit his agenda. He doesn't actually seek a broad range of views. He doesn't try and get to the nub of the problem. He isn't trying to resolve this important issue and use the power that he and Senator Hanson have in this place to pursue an agenda that will ensure that this issue can be dealt with fairly—and there does need to be reform. Instead, Senator Roberts just seeks the narrow view that he already has and he tries to further foster that and cause divide and disquiet in the community. It's unfortunate that's what One Nation and Senator Roberts want to use their two important votes they have in this chamber for. Instead of trying to further the national interest or resolve a difficult situation, he's trying to seek division and encourage it wherever possible.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">If you listened to Senator Roberts' speech, you would have the view that the Australian Brotherhood of Fathers are running around the countryside doing only good deeds. But the facts on record actually speak differently to that. When you look at their history, it is a chequered history of helping people who are going through very difficult family law scenarios. It's been reported in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span></span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Instead of confining himself to offering suggestions that help men cope with mental health problems and stress, Erikson has suggested they self-harm as a form of political protest.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">"Don't hide away in a dark corner. Take yourself down to your state and federal members' office and let them witness your final act in person," Erikson recently posted on Facebook.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is some advice that Mr Erikson has been on the public record saying, and this was reported in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017 it was reported that One Nation reached out to the website Blokes Advice to sound out what their huge membership wanted. They had a three-hour meeting, and in April 2017 members of the Facebook group Blokes Advice met with representatives of One Nation for what one of the group's administrators called 'a mashing of minds'. Facebook actually shut this group down in August of that year, after it was accused of glorifying rape and violence against women. It was immediately re-formed and administrators say that kind of post got shut down and wasn't allowed anymore. It is worth noting that Mr Erikson was very active in this group as well. This was reported on by the ABC.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear, when you look at who Senator Roberts is actually relying on as part of this debate, that One Nation doesn't actually have the best interests of all those families involved in sorting this out. There's no doubt that there are significant legal challenges, and the fact that this government has been in power for six years and hasn't actually administered significant changes to assist in this only further prolongs the difficulties that many families are facing. I thought it was important to put on the record the context in which Senator Roberts comes to this debate. The fact that he is so narrow minded in pursing the objectives that he and One Nation want to pursue certainly needs to be acknowledged. And it does need to be recognised that the interest that One Nation has in this area isn't about getting the best outcomes for families in Queensland going through difficult scenarios; One Nation is actually trying to promote these people and give them a voice that is based on the predisposition of One Nation and what they want to pursue in this issue.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk about the significant problems that we currently face with the family law system. It has led to unacceptable delays for vulnerable families, and particularly for children, and there's no doubt that the ineptitude of this government over the last six years has aided and abetted that. There have been many factors that have led to the current state of affairs: the failure of the government to reappoint judges in a timely manner for the past six years, the ever-growing funding shortages for legal assistance services and a number of inefficiencies, particularly within the family law system. There's no doubt that changes have to be made, and Labor's priority is making sure that these changes are right and are done for the correct reasons so that there is a sense of balance and fairness.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General, Christian Porter, spent most of last year pursuing legislation that would have abolished the Family Court system in this country altogether. The legislation was introduced without any consultation with the community or the legal profession. Incredibly, the government tried to push these proposed reforms through the parliament before the completion of a landmark review into the family law system by the Australian Law Reform Commission. The report was the most comprehensive review of the family law system in four decades, but the government was intent on ignoring it. Instead, it chose to base its proposed reforms on a six-week desktop review by two accountants. Thankfully, in the last week of parliament before the election, the minister was forced to back down from his proposed reforms when he realised he did not have the numbers to get these damaging changes through the parliament. In April 2019, shortly after backing away from his own reform proposal to abolish the Family Court system altogether, the minister finally released the Australian Law Reform Commission's report on the family law system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Law Reform Commission has made 60 recommendations for reform, including that the resolution of family law disputes eventually be returned to the states and territories. Labor is carefully considering each of these recommendations in consultation with the many stakeholder groups inside the family law system, including Australian families who've been through the existing system, family lawyers and judges. Those discussions will ultimately inform the approach that we take to addressing these problems with the current family law system during this term of parliament. Sensible and evidence based reform of the family law system is long overdue and should be a high priority for politicians from all sides of politics. At the same time, Labor will continue to push back against any attempts from the minister and the government to ram through without proper consultation poorly considered and damaging reforms to the family law system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Court of Australia was established by the Whitlam government over four decades ago. Ensuring that the Family Court system works for Australian families has been and always will be a priority for Labor. Indeed, Labor does have a proud record in this area, and it is one that we're extremely frustrated about, having now watched the government's six years of inaction and six years of delays to changes. It has shown a real slowness to act when it comes to reform in this important area. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that, for the many families who are going through a difficult separation, it is a very, very tough time, and there needs to be as much support for those families as possible. Unlike One Nation, we don't think that you should therefore take sides in that debate. You need to be even-handed and ensure that that the system is fair and that it be dealt with but also acknowledge that the families involved are going through a difficult period. From our personal experiences of observing friends and family members going through this, we know how difficult these challenges can be for the family unit. It is important that governments act in the best interests of all involved and ensure not only that the legal system is as fair as possible and as neutral as possible but also that issues can be resolved in a way where there isn't so much financial damage done to families. That is what Labor are committed to, and we want the government to act to ensure that families in Australia are better represented as a result.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  Firstly, can I say at the outset that family conflict and separation are always heartbreaking. We all agree that children have the right to grow up in a family that's loving, stable and safe. Our paramount concern is the safety and wellbeing of children. That's why the government is taking action to improve Australia's family law system. Our commitment to making improvements to the family law system is to ensure that we help families separate in a safe, supportive and timely way. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has already committed to delivering structural reform of the federal family law courts to help end the unnecessary costs and delay for thousands of Australian families that arise from a split federal Family Court system. This will allow families to have their matters dealt with as efficiently as possible and under a single set of rules and procedures. These reforms will significantly improve the family law system. They'll reduce the backlog of matters before the family law courts and drive timely, cheaper and more consistent resolution of disputes for Australian families. It's estimated that these structural reforms have the potential, in time, to allow thousands of additional cases to be resolved each and every year. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will bring together the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, to be known as the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. The FCFC will become, in effect, a single point of entry into the family law jurisdiction of the Federal Court system and will create a consistent pathway for Australian families in having their family law disputes dealt with in the federal courts. This government also commissioned the first comprehensive review of the family law system in 40 years. That review, released in April this year, contained 60 recommendations for the family law system. The government is carefully considering the ALRC's wide-ranging review of the family law system and is intent on ensuring the system works for Australian families, keeps them safe, and allows for efficient and timely separations. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's commitment to improvements to the family law system is clear from the range of significant measures it has taken to assist and protect separating families, including the establishment and now extension of specialist domestic violence units and health justice partnerships, which provide legal and social support assistance to vulnerable women experiencing family violence. The government is also establishing and extending family advocacy and support services, which provide duty lawyers at family law courts to provide services to families affected by family violence. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2019-20 budget, an additional $7.8 million was committed over three years for dedicated men's support workers to be engaged in all locations. The dedicated men's and support workers will provide access to support services for both alleged perpetrators and male victims of family violence. There is $50 million over four years for family law property mediation as part of the Women's Economic Security Package; $11 million to improve information sharing between family law, family violence and child protection, including the co-location of state and territory family safety officials in family law courts and prohibiting perpetrators of family violence from cross-examining their victims in family law proceedings; $7 million to legal aid commissions to represent affected parties; and $10.7 million over four years for the family law courts to employ up to 17 additional qualified social workers and psychologists as family consultants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">These recent measures are on top of the $160 million per year for family law services to support people with family law disputes outside of court. These services include counselling and education programs, and were accessed by 70,000 men and 86,000 women last year. The Child Support Scheme is designed to ensure parents take responsibility for the ongoing financial care of their children in line with their financial capacity to do so. Child support assessments are generally based on the child support formula, which uses both parents' adjusted taxable income from the last relevant financial year. Overall, the child support system provides services to 1.3 million separated parents, and transfers $3.5 billion in financial support for approximately 1.1 million children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There has already been substantial work undertaken to improve the system. The government agreed to 18 of the 25 recommendations of the House of Representatives inquiry into the child support program. Of these, 12 have been implemented to date, reflecting real improvements made to the system. These include the three priority recommendations that were addressed in the Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Act 2018, and will assist in making around 700,000 child support cases fairer every year by: strengthening incentives to comply with court orders or to participate in dispute resolution processes about care; enabling changes in circumstances to be more easily reflected where parents have a child support agreement; allowing amended tax assessments to be used in a broader range of circumstances; and treating receiving parents with overpaid child support consistently with paying parents with debts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Work is continuing to implement other agreed recommendations, including two recommendations which relate to services and mediation for parents to negotiate child support arrangements; a recommendation to conduct a performance audit of the scheme's legal enforcement service; and three more complex recommendations relating to the child support formula and related change-of-assessment processes. Together, these measures constitute significant changes and improvements to the scheme, and will provide ongoing improvements to children and parents.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="252157" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  I rise to say a few words on this motion. There is no doubt that there are significant problems with the family law system which lead to real heartache for many vulnerable families around Australia. In fact, we heard from Senator Hanson this morning about her own difficult experiences with family break-up, and I thank her for sharing those with the Senate. However, this motion is not well directed and it won't offer the help that families genuinely need today.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The child support program has already been reported on relatively recently by one of the committees of this parliament. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs presented its report on the child support program in 2015. the report found that, generally speaking, the child support program was functioning as intended. That is not to say that it doesn't need significant improvement, and the committee did make 25 recommendations in its report—25 recommendations that the government have been, typically, slow to implement. But that should be no surprise to anyone in this place, because this is a government that has no plan to make life better for families in this country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need is more support for families on the critical issues facing them, and one of those critical issues is family violence. We know that in Australia today one woman per week is murdered by a current or former partner. Family violence hurts—it hurts women and it hurts children—and its effects can be felt for generations. We know that one in three Australian women will experience physical violence in their lifetime. The only way that we'll successfully tackle men's violence against women is through a consistent and coordinated long-term approach. We need a united response in this place to change this. We need national leadership in this parliament to confront the persistent and shameful prevalence of violence against women and their children. There are many places that, as a parliament, we can put our attention: more support for frontline services, more options for emergency accommodation, more support for legal services for both women and men, and more safe and affordable housing for people escaping violence. As a country, we need to confront the underlying causes of family violence—that is, persistent gender inequality in this country today. We can do it by focusing on supporting respectful relationships in schools and by supporting men with programs to help them understand and change their behaviours. Of course, if Labor had been elected in May this year we would have legislated 10 days paid domestic violence leave as part of the National Employment Standards, because people experiencing family violence shouldn't have to choose between leaving a violent relationship and keeping their job. Families are under enormous pressure today and they need a united response and real leadership from this government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need is more support for families who today, around the country, are facing incredible hardship. They want to know: what is the government's plan to help them out? Families are facing extreme cost-of-living pressures. Everything is going up. Bills are going up. Housing is going up. Child care, healthcare, transport—they're all going up. Meanwhile, under this government, family incomes are going backwards. Wages are just not keeping up, and living standards have declined under this Liberal government. Median household incomes have actually gone down under this government. What that means is that at kitchen tables around the country today people are making tough decisions about whether to pay their bills or whether to put food on the table. Families today are labouring under extreme household debt loads. Household debt has surged to record levels under this government. And these tough decisions are being made by families because this government has no plan for the economy in this country and no plan for a family budget. Under this government, economic growth is now at its lowest level since the global financial crisis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this is putting massive pressure on families. I think about one of my Victorian constituents, a woman called Kylie who lives in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. She's a single mother of three children. Her wages have been flat for six years under this government. Meanwhile, housing costs have gone through the roof. Because her wages can't keep up with the skyrocketing costs of housing, she lives in a shared house with another family, with her three children, so that she can make the rent. These are the issues facing families. We need the government to take action on these issues now. With low wages, declining incomes, skyrocketing costs of living and extreme household debt, families are under enormous pressure in Australia today and they need a united response and national leadership from this government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What about support for those families living on Newstart? Newstart payments are so low that people are getting stuck in poverty. Rather than being a temporary payment that helps get people back into work, it actually prevents them from getting work. Newstart payments are so low that people can't afford transport to even get to interviews. They can't afford appropriate clothes and equipment. They can't afford to access the education and training they need to get back to work. And what about the children in those families? In Australia, one of the richest countries in the world, everyone should be able to afford the basics and every child should get the very best start in life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just my side of the parliament that thinks that Newstart is too low. Members of the government's own backbench believe it needs to be increased. Even former leaders of the Liberal Party have come forward to argue the case for the Newstart payment to finally get a raise. We must ask: despite overwhelming community support with 75 per cent of Australians supporting an increase to Newstart, why won't the government move to grant a raise in the Newstart rate and why doesn't the government have a plan for those low-income and vulnerable families?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, instead of looking to increase the rate of Newstart, this government would rather penalise these Australians further by rolling out the flawed cashless welfare card and by subjecting them to mandatory drug tests. It is so insulting; it is so out of touch. What these low-income and vulnerable Australians need is a united response and national leadership from this government. But given this third-term coalition government's record, I cannot see this happening on any of these issues, and these are the issues that are of real concern to Australian families today.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">While there are many pressing issues for families around our country, I don't believe that this motion is the right way to go for them. While the government has been slow to implement the recommendations to improve the child support system, this motion won't do anything to speed the government up and it won't help Australian families confront the major challenges they face today under this third-term Liberal government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  I recall the first meeting I had with the former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2016 after I was newly elected. I sat there at his Bligh Street office. He'd just poured a fresh cup of green tea, and I hit him with my No. 1 priority of family law reform. He said, 'That's a tough one, Pauline.' I'll never forget those words. I felt as though he was mentally building a brick wall to the very suggestion of fixing our broken family law system. And here I am today, with my sledgehammer, still trying to break down that same brick wall that continues to prevent a review into the family law system. By the close of business today another three funerals will have been announced by the families of men who've taken their own lives, and the unjustified murder of another woman will have occurred by Friday because of our life-destroying family law system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">On Friday, I outlined a number of suggestions I believe are required to modernise our country's outdated child support system. My press release stated I was calling for a joint parliamentary inquiry into family law. I wrote that it's time to overhaul the 1988 child support system with a three-point plan to repair the payment calculation so that non-custodial parents are able to continue to meet the needs of their children without creating a lifestyle for their former partners. You see, the current system penalises non-custodial parents who work overtime and take on a second job. They are forced to pay the custodial parent based on before tax earnings. It's my belief that child support calculations should be based on a standard 38-hour week. Therefore, it would quarantine overtime payments and the earnings from a second job. By doing this, it would bring child support payments in line with Australia's superannuation ordinary time earnings. In other words, employers must pay 9.5 per cent superannuation on guaranteed hours. Overtime is not guaranteed hours; therefore, superannuation does not have to be paid as per the National Employment Standards. Why should a person who decides to work their guts out on their days off lose an enormous chunk of that money? It not only deters a person from putting in the hard yards, but it prevents the non-custodial parent from getting back on their feet and ahead in life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I also believe a new child support formula should be broken into three categories where non-custodial parents are obliged to meet the needs of a child in prep, primary and high school. I hear daily complaints from non-custodial parents, predominantly men, who tell me that they are being fleeced by their former partners, who often deny access to the child yet reap large proportions of their former partner's before tax earnings that never fully benefit the child. I've sent a detailed term of reference to inquire into family law to Attorney-General Christian Porter and have called on the government to hold a 12-month inquiry that I would chair. If the government agrees to this inquiry, it's important we take it to areas right across the country and not just to the major cities. All Australians deserve a voice on our broken family law system, so I'm prepared to go to far-reaching parts of the country to hear from them.</span>

The stories are heartbreaking, and you can feel the deep seated pain throughout each person's individual story. If there is one thing the Prime Minister should do tonight, it's jump on my Facebook page and just spend 30 minutes going through some of the comments. In fact, I'd recommend you all take the time to ask your own Facebook followers what they think about a royal commission or an inquiry into family law. I can guarantee you that the response from people will be strongly supportive. This goes beyond party politics, colour or creed, and it is time we fixed it. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">I can speak openly about my own case to do with child support. My husband from my first marriage paid me absolutely nothing. I supported those two children—one as young as six months old and the other four years old—and I struggled to end make ends, but I got there at the end of the day. As for my second husband, all I wanted from him was support of $20 for each child, and he didn't even want to pay that. The courts wanted me to go after it, the solicitors wanted me to go to $50, and I said, 'No, I'm quite happy with $20 each,' and he wouldn't even pay that. When he want to drag me through the courts, I said, 'You know what? Keep your money. I'm not interested. I will rear my children and pay for their education myself,' which I did. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There are parents out there who truly want to see their children, want to have a connection with their children, who would gladly pay child support if it is fair and just. That's all these people are asking for: what is fair and just. Don't destroy a person's life by making them pay exorbitant amounts of child support. It is fair to consider a 38-hour week and for them to pay their fair share of child support to support their children, but don't deny them access to see their children. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier today, get over the hurt, the hate and the pain, and move on with your lives. At the end of the day, it's all about the children. And, if that means that you pay your way in making sure the kids are well looked after, fed and clothed and get a good education, that is what is important. But a lot of these people will not work and will give up their jobs to go on welfare, because the system is charging them too much and they can see themselves never getting ahead in life. Make child support fair and just, and a lot more people will face their responsibilities and go and get a job, and get on with their lives.</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />Once this Bill is passed, veterans will only need to present their DVA Health Card at the time of receiving medical treatment and payments will be made directly to health providers via the Medicare system. Around 4000 clients will no longer have to pay up front and then seek reimbursement from DVA. Importantly, this Bill retains discretionary power for the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to reimburse a person the cost of treatment or pay directly a health provider in special circumstances. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Education Amendment (2019 Measures No. 1) would establish a choice and affordability slush fund for private schools. Commencing in 2020, the fund would provide an estimated $1.2 billion to private schools over the 10 years to 2029 and barely any accountability or criteria for how this money will be spent. This is public money that should be going to our grossly underfunded public schools, not private schools. If ever we had a perfect symbol of education and inequality in Australia then surely this has to be it: a big pile of cash for the Catholic and independent school sector announced a year ago to buy their silence in the election. This slush fund will only serve to widen the already extreme gap between public and private schools in Australia, fuelling further inequities introduced by Labor and Liberal governments in special deal after special deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's how bad things are: by 2023, 99 per cent of public schools will be stuck below the national resource standard while 99 per cent of private schools will be at or above it. This will leave public schools $22.7 billion below the minimum amount of funding they need to deliver quality education for our children. This is despite public schools educating the majority of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. But how much money does this fund have for public schools? Not one cent. We're in this situation because both Labor and the Liberals are guilty of making grubby deals with the private school sector to buy their silence and compliance with education reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Analysis by the ABC has revealed that the percentage of private schools receiving more public funding than similar public schools was 58 per cent in 2009. After a decade of special deals, that figure is now a whopping 85 per cent. Over the last decade, non-government school funding per student has grown 2.7 times faster than public school funding per student. Things are now so unequal that while 99 per cent of public schools struggle on without even the basic level of funding they need, Department of Education data shows some private schools on the North Shore of Sydney receive more than double the amount of federal funding that they are entitled to. How much money does this fund have for public schools? Not one cent. And that's not to mention the facilities and infrastructure. The federal government's capital fund for schools is dedicated entirely to private schools. Over the last two years they spent more than $311 million on 314 private schools. Between 2013 and 2017 Australia's four richest schools spent more on new facilities and renovations than the poorest 1,800 schools combined. Meanwhile, public school students and teachers continue to sweat it out in demountable classrooms waiting years to do basic repair work while private schools build luxury facilities like indoor sport centres, Olympic sized pools or an auditorium with an adjustable orchestra pit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No example makes the inhumanity of the government's approach to capital funding clearer than Alekarenge School, which is 350 kilometres  north of Alice Springs. The entire school is made up of temporary classrooms that will be 50 years old next year. For half a century the school has had to survive with substandard facilities, which have now deteriorated to a horrifying extent. Students at Alekarenge are endangered by exposed live wires hanging in their classroom. Condemned buildings remain on school grounds, riddled with broken asbestos, because they are supposedly too expensive to remove. With no funding for fencing, teachers have been forced to build a cage for students to eat lunch in so they're not attacked by wild dogs. This is not some scene from a dystopian novel. It's the standard this government thinks is acceptable for public school students in the 21st century while it throws money at private schools.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One consequence of criminal underfunding is that 93 per cent of public school teachers dip into their own pocket to buy stationery and classroom equipment. Nearly half of them buy library resources and textbooks to make up for the lack of government funding. But how much money does this fund have for public schools? Not one cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To this gross pile of inequality the government has added this $1.2 billion private school slush fund. It might just be the latest in a long line of special deals, but it's particularly stunning for how obscenely unnecessary it is. The dirty deal struck last September is exactly what happens when a government doesn't have the mettle to stand up to the cashed-up private school lobby. The slush fund wasn't even on the table during months of negotiations over reforming the method of measuring parents' incomes. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> reported that it wasn't until Prime Minister Scott Morrison plotted his way to the prime ministership and exiled Senator Birmingham from the education ministry that the idea of doling out cash to buy the private school sector's silence was entertained. But entertained it was, and in a big way. When he announced the deal, Minister Tehan had the hide to describe it as sector-blind, despite it not containing one cent for public schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even setting the injustice aside, the choice and affordability slush fund is just a masterclass in terrible policy development. The government haven't even been able to land on a halfway plausible excuse for handing the money over. They've talked about affordability of private schools, but analysis from the Grattan Institute has made it clear that this funding is all about keeping Catholic school fees down in wealthy areas. Even if propping up private schools in lower socioeconomic areas was a greater priority than supporting desperately underfunded government schools, the analysis shows that the $1.2 billion is ten times more than what would be needed to do it. This is the furthest thing from the principle of needs based funding everyone in this place claims to subscribe to. How on earth can anyone in the Labor or Liberal parties justify subsidising private school fees while public schools cry out for basic funding?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At other times the Prime Minister has banged on about choice. Well, Prime Minister, let's talk about choice. Choice in education would be best supported by ensuring that every student has the option of a well-funded, world-class public education in their local school. Without that choice we fail generation after generation of students and families who rely on universal free public education to get their start in life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Next, and most absurdly, the government suggested the money might go to drought-affected areas, as if only private schools in areas of drought would need support and underfunded public schools in those areas would just be left high and extremely dry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And here's the kicker: despite their weasel words on how the fund might be used, there are still no guidelines as to how it will be governed and no indication that the government will do anything to compel private schools to spend the funds in a particular way. The cash will simply be handed to Catholic and independent school authorities to dispense as they see fit. There are no rules and no criteria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to my questioning in estimates, the department had no idea how the enormous figure of $1.2 billion was actually arrived at. There was no reasonable model or formula behind this number; there was only craven self-interest and a Liberal-National government desperate to throw out enough money to appease the private school sector. I've pursued the government on this in estimates and during question time, and they've done nothing but stonewall, completely unable to justify this absurd expense. Even if this were the right use of government funds, which it absolutely is not, there is no transparency with this money and no indication that the government will hold the private school sector to account. We have no real idea what these schools will spend the money on or how much will go to subsidising the fees of parents who could afford to pay more, while public schools cry out for basics like air-conditioned classrooms and an end to demountables. For that reason alone, the fund should be disallowed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are proudly the party of public education. We are unapologetic in our advocacy for a well-resourced, world-class public education system. We will always stand against grubby special deals. The Greens are the only party with a plan to fully fund every single public school to meet the educational needs of its students, no matter their postcode or their parents' bank balance. We are the only party committed to delivering at least $300 million in infrastructure funding to public schools so they can build the learning and teaching facilities they need. And we are the only party committed to reversing the deals that keep private schools overfunded at the expense of our public schools. Why? For the Greens it's simple. With public money, the 2.5 million children in public schools have to come first.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad to say that we are not alone in calling this fund what it is. The Australian Education Union described it as 'a cynical attempt by the Morrison government to buy votes at the next election at the expense of students in our public schools'. The Grattan Institute called for it to be scrapped. And Labor, even with their own rich history of special deals for private schools, were able to say it looked very much like a slush fund—before they rolled over just in time for the election. It's thoroughly disappointing but, I'm afraid to say, not surprising to see that Labor will be rejecting this opportunity to stand with students, teachers and parents struggling in public schools around the country. They really can't have it both ways on this. Labor can't welcome billions for already overfunded private schools, as they did last year, and then just cross their fingers that money for public schools might somehow appear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that the Greens are the real opposition in this place and the real defenders of public education in parliament. Today we have the opportunity to draw a line in the sand, to say no to special deals and the inequality that they create. We have the chance to restore a little sanity to the school funding policy and begin the process of unwinding the years of unfair advantage private schools have enjoyed under Labor and Liberal governments. I do urge my crossbench colleagues and those in the Labor Party not just to talk a big game on supporting public education but to join the Greens and support this motion. I commend the motion to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I rise to speak in opposition to the disallowance motion. The Choice and Affordability Fund was announced in September 2018 as part of the government's response to the National School Resourcing Board's review of the socioeconomic status score methodology. It will provide $1.2 billion in funding over 10 years to supplement federal funding for Catholic and independent schools; support parental choice and affordability of non-government schools; and meet other government priorities, such as assisting schools in rural and regional areas and in drought affected areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have been clear that we have serious concerns about the architecture, transparency and sustainability of the Choice and Affordability Fund. The fund makes no pretence that it is needs based, and there is no guarantee that it will go to the most disadvantaged schools and to the education of the needier students. However, with this fund, the Liberals have restored the money they ripped off Catholic and independent schools, and we welcome the restoration of that funding. But they now must do the same for the public school system. The highest priority of those opposite should be to restore the billions of dollars that they robbed from our public schools. It's quite galling to be lectured to by the Greens in this place—the same party that tried to team up with the Liberals in the past to cut some $22 billion from our public schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only Labor has stood side by side with our public schools against the Liberal and National government's cuts. Supporting this disallowance motion today won't make a single public school better off. As such, Labor will oppose this motion today.</span>

The government is committed to providing affordable choice to Australian families when it comes to education. That is why we have established the $1.2 billion Choice and Affordability Fund. The fund recognises that the Australian government is the majority funder of non-government schools. States, as the majority funder of government schools, already provide additional support to government schools that is not available to non-government schools. The fund will be used to assist schools in regional and remote areas and in drought affected areas, assist schools during the transition to the new capacity-to-contribute measure, enhance student wellbeing and support initiatives, and strengthen educational outcomes in schools.</span>

The government is making good its promise of big cash for the private school sector without doing a single thing for public schools. Nothing any of you have said—and you really haven't said much—can paper over the fact that you are voting for widening the divide between the haves and the have-nots of the Australian education system. It's not only a state responsibility to make sure that public education gets the funding that it needs; it is absolutely incumbent on the federal government to make sure that the gap in inequality does not widen, but that's exactly what you both—Labor and Liberals—are voting on today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parents, teachers and the community do know much better than the transparent weasel words of those of you who are sitting here. You know that. There is absolutely no justification for the choice and affordability slush fund to exist. I reiterate: there are no guidelines. No-one knows—not even the department could answer my questions—how the formula for the money was developed, where the money is going to go and what criteria are being used for that. Around the country, surely we have to have a better deal for public schools. We have to reverse the neglect that public schools have suffered for years. But we can't do that when public schools are overlooked each and every time by the federal government. There needs to be some leadership shown by you lot.</span>

It's the perfect symbol of education inequality that has been rising in Australia—a big pile of cash for private schools, with no justification, no guidelines and no accountability. The Greens proudly put forward this motion to disallow this Liberal slush fund for private schools.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Fair Work Amendment (Casual Loading Offset) Regulations 2018, made under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009</span>, be disallowed [F2018L01770].</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion seeks to disallow the Fair Work Amendment (Casual Loading Offset) Regulations 2018, enacted as a result of the full Federal Court decision in WorkPac Pty Ltd v Skene [2018] FCAFC 131, which concluded that a worker who was employed on a regular, predictable and ongoing basis was not a casual employee. The instrument was introduced by the government in December 2018, after the parliament had risen, as a desperate attempt to placate employer lobby groups and labour hire firms who had been exposed using and abusing casual employment as an avoidance device to deny workers their entitlements and rights under Australian law. On the other hand, this disallowance motion supports hardworking Australian workers who've been wrongly categorised as casual workers and have subsequently been deprived of their entitlements under the National Employment Standards, such as the right to paid annual leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The background of the making of the instrument has received much media attention and some hysteria from employer groups who are fearful that the past and current poor employment practices may be coming back to haunt them. For those unaware of the background, Paul Skene worked for WorkPac at Anglo's Dawson mine and then for a longer period as a fly-in fly-out worker, a haul truck operator, at Clermont mine, for about 2½ years. Critically, his rosters were set 12 months in advance on two occasions. He worked 12½-hour shifts seven days on, seven days off. He lived in the company camp and was flown in and out of work at the company's expense. Mr Skene was paid weekly at a flat hourly rate and filled in his timesheet each week. Despite the fact that his pay was claimed by WorkPac to be in lieu of annual leave and other entitlements, Mr Skene's flat hourly rate was 29.4 per cent less than that of the permanent full-time employees engaged by Rio Tinto working side by side with him.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very important point. Despite the obvious similarities to full-time permanent employment, Mr Skene was called a casual. When his employment was terminated, in April 2012, he received no annual leave payout. His situation reflects what many employees hired through labour hire companies are experiencing. The court held that Mr Skene was not a casual and should have been paid annual leave under the National Employment Standards in the Fair Work Act. The court decided that there is an objective approach to determining whether or not somebody is a casual—that is, if the substance of the employment relationship is that of a permanent employee then they cannot be a casual. Over the 2½ years of Mr Skene's employment he had regular, predictable hours. The court found that he had a firm, advance commitment to his days or hours of employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The employer, WorkPac, argued that Mr Skene was employed as a casual under the agreement and, essentially, that they had the right to define him as a casual irrespective of the reality of his working arrangements. The court said that if WorkPac's arguments were accepted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… an employee designated to be a casual but working a full-time pattern of work (eg 9.00am to 5.00pm, Monday-Friday) in on-going employment never gains an entitlement to take paid leave, irrespective of how many months or years that pattern of work continues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's at page 128 of the decision. The court rejected this argument, saying that the purpose of the National Employment Standards could be readily defeated if employers could simply designate an employee to be a casual irrespective of the true nature of the employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The full Federal Court decision affirmed that the common law objective test of casual employment applies to whether an employee is eligible for National Employment Standards entitlements under the Fair Work Act 2009 where the absence of a firm advance commitment as to the duration of the employee's employment or the days or hours the employee will work is the essence of casualness. The key indicators of an absence of a firm advance commitment are:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… irregularity, uncertainty, unpredictability, intermittency and discontinuity in the pattern of work of the employee in question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a consequence of Skene, where an employee has been employed pursuant to an award or enterprise agreement as a casual but the conditions of their employment do not satisfy the common law definition of casual, they may be entitled to claim unpaid National Employment Standards entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Employer groups responded to the Skene decision by claiming that the decision may allow employees employed as casuals under the instrument to double dip—that is, to receive a casual loading pursuant to that instrument but then also claim back pay for the National Employment Standards entitlements based on the common law definition of 'casual'. That is a claim I will address in a minute. Some employers have expressed surprise at the WorkPac decision while at the same time admitting that millions of Australian workers were working in similar arrangements to those of the WorkPac case—that is, as so-called casuals without any leave entitlements and in breach of the most basic workplace entitlements under the National Employment Standards in the Fair Work Act. Employers lobbied the government to take action on the basis that they want to be able to unilaterally determine who is and who is not a casual employee, which would further entrench insecure work amongst the Australian workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The WorkPac v Skene ruling exposes wage stagnation and a chronic underpayment of workers in many industries dominated by large corporations. Despite the hysteria of the employer groups who have criticised moves to disallow this regulation, this Court ruling does not mean all casual employees on set rosters are equivalent to permanent employees. But what has been highlighted is that many working Australians are trapped in the same permanent casualisation trap as Mr Skene, and those workers deserve a real government response rather than this politically expedient regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is facing a crisis of insecure work, as I'm sure you're aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher, and less than half of all Australians now have a permanent full-time paid job with a right to paid leave. One-quarter of all employees—one in four, or more than half of young employees aged 15 to 24—are now deemed casual employees. According to the ACTU and the ABS figures, since 2013, when the Liberal and National parties came into government, casualisation has increased from 23.8 per cent to 25.1 per cent. Each one per cent is equivalent to an extra 120,000 people, so there are now an extra 154,000 people in casual jobs who would have been in permanent jobs had the 2013 ratio remained unchanged. But it's over a longer period that we can really see the alarming nature of this trend. In the last 35 years, casualisation has increased from 13 per cent of the workforce to that figure of 25 per cent that we see today. The permanent casual is now a significant feature of the Australian labour market. According to the most recent data, there are 2.6 million employees without paid leave entitlements, and up to 85 per cent of them work on a regular basis for their current employer. This is based on a range of statistical measures of regular work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we have the fallacious claim by employer groups that the full court decision somehow constitutes double dipping. Employer groups argue this is because casual employees are paid a loading to compensate them for other entitlements. So they say that having to repay employees the most basic of National Employment Standards entitlements as well is a double payment. The Federal Court found that Mr Skene was not a casual and in fact was paid 29.4 per cent less than the equivalent full-time employees even with the casual loading, so it's difficult to argue that double dipping occurred here. The fact is, as the Federal Court found, any double dipping here has been performed by the employer because they've taken advantage of the insecurity of casual work while still getting permanent hours out of their workforce for less cost. We often see examples of people working side by side doing the same job with the same hours but one is being paid as a casual on less money with no entitlements and the other as a permanent employee with full entitlements. Casual work is meant to be just that—casual. And using casual contracts for jobs that are, in fact, permanent is an abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fair Work Amendment (Casual Loading Offset) Regulations 2018 should be disallowed. It's a politically expedient and pointless attempt by the government to try to show employer groups that they are doing something. We know they have no plan for our country. We know they have no plan to deal with flat-lining wages, wage theft, job insecurity, rising prices, low rates of economic growth or anything else that is important to the lives of most Australians. I urge all senators to support this disallowance motion.</span>

This motion would remove a protection for small business, in particular, against claims to pay leave entitlements twice to casual employees. The regulation makes clear that an employer who engages a casual employee and pays casual loading can rely on that payment if later found to be liable to pay leave entitlements applicable to non-casual employees. Employers estimate that the liability to make payments twice could be as much as $8 billion. No reason has been advanced as to why this protection, which clarifies the common law, should not continue to provide this protection for small business.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  I rise on behalf of the Greens to make a short statement on the disallowance of the Fair Work Amendment (Casual Loading Offset) Regulations 2018. We all know that casualisation is up. We know that rising job insecurity is stretching people to breaking point. Working people are under attack like never before. They now have less certainty and fewer rights at work than at any time in recent history. Let me be blunt: insecure work is wrecking people's lives, yet this government is only about protecting big business. We know employers are abusing the use of casual employment by hiring workers as indefinite casuals or on rolling contracts. They do this so they have no obligation to provide long-term job security or minimum entitlements, like sick leave or annual leave, and this government is in the business of making that easier. They're making it easier for big business to exploit workers. They're making it easier for employers to claim that they didn't know the rules when they have clearly been established by the recent Federal Court of Australia decision in WorkPac v Skene. The case highlighted the fact that casual employment is being used widely by employers to deny workers even the most basic of entitlements under the National Employment Standards. The decision reaffirmed earlier court decisions in reiterating that just because an employer chooses to classify a worker as casual doesn't mean that the worker is indeed casual. We know that employers are trying to get out of paying entitlements to their workers. Through this regulation the government is now saying that, when employers are caught out treating someone as a casual who in reality is a permanent worker, the employer should be able to rely on their own wrongdoing to avoid paying the worker their full entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have been pushing for years to legislate for fair working conditions, legislation that would ensure that we have equal pay for equal work no matter whether you're classified as a casual or whether you work in the gig economy. For this government, though, everything is about being run for profit. It's all about systems that favour the wealthy and the big corporations. We know that wages have flatlined and too many people are in insecure work. We will fight any moves to cut the pay of this country's lowest-paid workers. Wage growth has stagnated, penalty rates have been cut, inequality is rising and underemployment remains stubbornly high, and casual workers are feeling the brunt of this big shift. The Greens have always stood up for casual and low-paid workers. We were the first to introduce legislation to bring back penalty rates and introduce bills that would extend minimum standards to all workers and allow long-term casuals to convert to full-time or part-time employees. The Greens will support this disallowance motion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am prompted to move this motion which, in its operative part, is identical to the motion that I put to the Senate about a week ago. It relates to Australia's relationship with China. It's simply too important for this parliament not to engage with this issue. The background to this motion is set out briefly in the first part of the motion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 31 July 2019, I gave notice of a motion to refer the issues of Australia's relationship with China to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for inquiry and report. On 18 August 2019, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Senator Wong, wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne, requesting comprehensive and detailed briefings for parliamentarians by relevant government agencies on Australia's relationship with China. On 6 September 2019, in a joint statement with Senator Kitching, Senator Wong formally reiterated Labor's request.</span>

The government's response to the motion, in its substance, amounted to no more than 96 words, and involved a declaration of the obvious: Australia's relationship with China is important, complex and needs to be managed from a national interest perspective. However, the government made no direct reference to the substance of the motion—that is, the proposed referral to the Senate FADT References Committee.</span>

                    </a>  Before the break I was talking about the reason I'm again moving this motion to refer a very important matter to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. That matter, the relationship between Australia and China, is so important. As I was saying just before the break, the last time we debated this motion the government spoke to the motion for a total of 96 words. That's how important China is to the government. They said it was an important and complex relationship. That is a given. I didn't need to hear some government senator tell me that. It's pretty obvious. They really didn't make any substantial contribution to the motion, so then, of course, I looked to Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party indicated they wouldn't support the motion. They indicated that their preference, instead of holding a Senate committee inquiry, was to request the government to provide confidential briefings for parliamentarians on China. Other speakers, from the Greens and the crossbench, supported the motion, but, lacking support from both the government and the opposition, the motion was defeated by a majority of 32—44 noes to 12 ayes. It was an uncommon line-up for the major parties against the crossbench and also a very worrying instance of self-censorship by the Senate. In effect, the coalition and Labor indicated that they did not wish there to be a parliamentary inquiry into one of the most important questions in Australia's foreign affairs, defence and trade policy. By any standards, it was a remarkable and quite perverse decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might reluctantly have let the matter rest there except that, in this chamber on Wednesday the 11th—last Wednesday—in response to a question from Senator Kitching, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne, advised the Senate that she would not support agency briefings relating to China as requested by the opposition. Senator Payne's response to the opposition was unambiguous. The government does not intend to share confidential information and assessments about China on a bilateral basis with opposition MPs and senators. However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs did note that relevant parliamentary committees 'such as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security or the foreign affairs, defence and trade committees' receive 'extensive briefings from agencies'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PJCIS deals with many sensitive issues and, notwithstanding the prohibition on the reviewing of intelligence operations, does receive highly classified briefings from our intelligence agencies, including general assessments of Australia's security environment and foreign espionage and foreign interference threats. The PJCIS might be briefed on matters that are subject to very interesting reports such as that today from Reuters, which claims that Australian Signals Directorate has identified China as the power behind hacking activities directed against the Australian parliament and major political parties. However, we don't know whether that's the case because the government refuses to speak on such matters. Unlike the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, the government is not prepared to talk openly about China's cyberespionage activities. In any case, while the PJCIS might be briefed on sensitive intelligence matters, it does not have the remit to examine wider questions of foreign policy, defence strategy, trade relations and people-to-people ties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The broader aspects of Australia's international relationship are properly the scope of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. As I noted in debate last Monday, there is, of course, nothing unusual in the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee conducting inquiries into Australia's relationship with various different countries. The Senate committee has done this before without controversy. For example, it did an inquiry in relation to China in 2005 and 2006. It did one into Papua New Guinea in 2010, the Indian Ocean region in 2013 and Mexico in 2015. Other parliamentary committees have also reviewed many aspects of Australia's relationship with China. In August 2012, for example, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade tabled a report on Australia's human rights dialogue with China. At present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is conducting an inquiry into Australia's free trade agreement between Australia and Hong Kong-China, and it held public hearings on that issue here in Canberra last week. So it seems logical that, given the government's refusal to agree with the opposition's request for confidential agency briefings on China, the senate, especially Labor, should again consider the establishment of an FADT references committee inquiry into Australia's relationship with China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bottom line is: you had an alternative approach, Labor. You laid it out and you said, 'We're going to get confidential briefings and that will negate the reason to have an inquiry into this most important issue.' You had an alternative approach, but that's been cut off at the knees by the foreign minister. That approach will not be entertained by the government. So now you have to think of something different to do, and I urge you to support this inquiry. This is the next best thing. In fact, I think the best thing to do is to have the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee conduct its inquiry. I know that members of the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee are enthusiastic about doing such an inquiry. In fact, it was Senator Kitching, the chair of that committee, who originally lodged this motion. She was quite enthusiastic about this particular motion going ahead.</span>

                    </a>  She's been shut down. That may well be the case. In effect, Labor has not supported its own member's inquiry that she originally lodged and I co-sponsored. That should raise concerns, because Senator Kitching is a very solid senator. She is actually quite responsible. She could chair a very measured inquiry into China, and, in some sense, it's disappointing that Labor wouldn't support such an inquiry with her chairing this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an alternative, noting your pathway is no longer available to you, Labor, I'd like to see a Senate inquiry. It would take into consideration the full range of expertise and interests from within and outside the Australian government. While Australian government agency briefings are important, they're only part of the wider range of information and views that a Senate inquiry might consider. We need to hear from businesses, from universities, from non-government organisations, from strategic analysts, from diplomatic experts, from human rights advocates, from technologists and scientists and from the Chinese-Australian community organisations—indeed, from all interested members of the Australian public. A Senate committee could also usefully hear the views of the Chinese embassy. I think an invitation for the Chinese ambassador to appear would be essential. We could also hear the views of other governments about China, China's ranging role and China's standing in regional and global affairs. This is a vital relationship, and the parliament urgently needs to undertake a most rigorous and holistic inquiry to see how we can maximise benefits from a mutually beneficial trading relationship but equally gain understanding of where caution is warranted in Australia's national interests. We need to explore all of this. In earlier times in modern Chinese history, Communist Party of China Chairman Mao Zedong announced a policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. That brief policy of liberalisation came to an end when Mao cracked down on those who criticised the communist regime, but the phrase has much resonance in the Australia-China policy debate today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rise of China is the biggest issue in our international relations and will be for the foreseeable future. This is not something on which the parliament can engage in self-censorship. If we are to build a solid, national consensus about how we manage this vitally important relationship, we need to explore all aspects. We need to openly examine all the options—all the pros, all the cons and all the trade-offs, strategic and economic. But one thing we can't trade off is our sovereignty and our freedom of our democratic institutions to consider international issues in the national interest. If we are to do that, we need to first let a thousand flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate references inquiry proposed by this motion is the way to do that in a rigorous, open and thoughtful way, engaging all elements of opinion with the Australian parliament—the coalition, Labor, the Greens and the crossbench. With that, we might just find our way through the current partisan controversies and move towards developing a forward-thinking approach to this critically important relationship that will enjoy support not only across this parliament but also across the broad Australian community. If we don't do that, and if the major parties decide that this is too hard and instead engage in further political self-censorship, then it might be that our policy choices have already been made for us and that Chinese soft power may already be being felt inside this chamber and may be very effectively reaching deep inside this chamber. As I said last week, this would bode ill for Australian democracy and for our sovereignty, and I commend this motion to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:42</span>):  In offering my support for Senator Patrick's motion, there is a note of caution which I want to put on the record. Of course, it is that Australia's national interest always has to come first, and the government must make judgement calls in areas of national security, defence and intelligence. In my history and my experience in this place, governments of both political persuasions have been quite diligent about advising and updating those of us who have been on the crossbench or, when I was part of a major party, on the back bench with appropriate briefings, marked by the requirement to keep things confidential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this motion because I think there are a whole range of areas in which our relationship—our business partnership, in some respects—with China needs some scrutiny, and there are a raft of them. You could talk about foreign students in this country. You could talk about tourism. You could talk about our trade relationship, of course, and our foreign investment. There are issues such as human rights, which have been canvassed by Senator Patrick earlier, but ultimately it comes back to this: if you don't know how much influence your major customer has—and China, quite frankly, is our major customer—then they can effectively control your business. My deep concern is that if the Communist Party of China decides to pull the pin on the Australian economy by not allowing any more foreign students to come here because we're asking them to actually study rather than be political activists, or if they say, 'We're going to punish you and not buy your iron ore or your cattle because you're not pursuing our policy intentions or you're challenging us in the South China Sea,' or if they say, 'We're not going to have Australia on the approved tourist limit,' effectively our economy—and I truly believe this—would be crippled. I don't want to see that happen. But I don't know whether that is the case or not because I don't know the full extent of the Chinese diaspora, the Chinese trade or the Chinese investment and how important these sections and elements of the industry have been to our national wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to aspects of human rights, let me put this on the record: the disruption in Hong Kong is because those who are perhaps most familiar with the Chinese system of government outside of mainland China itself didn't want to have an extradition agreement. They know the rule of law does not apply in China as it does in this country, or as it does in many Western democracies. There is a 99.9 per cent conviction rate. You don't even have to go to trial; you can just be locked up in the gulags. It astounds me that a previous coalition government, led by Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop, wanted to pursue, and were prepared to ratify, an extradition agreement for Chinese Australians to be sent over to face a 99.9 per cent conviction rate. It was one of my proudest moment in this Senate when a disallowance motion was moved and the Greens got on board very early, the crossbench got on board very early and the Labor Party got on board and, essentially we disallowed that instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what was the fathoming by the Australian government at the time—the Malcolm Turnbull-Julie Bishop government—that they were going to send Chinese Australians off to face the 99.9 per cent conviction rate? They wouldn't do it with North Korea and they wouldn't do it with Cuba. But why? What happened? How did our politics become so influenced and captive to them if it's not just about trade?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another proud moment was on <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> when I was asked about former Senator Dastyari's begging of a billionaire to pay his $1,500 travel bill. It unravelled a can of worms—a thread that we can keep tugging on today because we do not know how deep the influence goes.</span>

                    </a>  It's not my greatest legacy, Senator Whish-Wilson, it's one of the many legacies I will leave here! And I will go through those for a very long time in my valedictory speech. In fact, it could go for several hours, Senator Whish-Wilson! You will feature prominently in it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are serious issues at work here, and unless we can get to the bottom of them and confront the relationship we have to have then we are essentially flying blind. And so my interest is not so much in knowing how many times the Chinese government and other governments try to hack into the Parliament House computer system. I'm a big boy; I know these things happen all over the world. It's about the integrity of our system. How reliant are we, as a government and as a nation, on a foreign country? How influenced are we in our affairs being predetermined by the actions of someone somewhere else?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a universal concern. There are those on the Liberal coalition side, there are those on the crossbench and there are those on the Labor side who are concerned about this. One of them, of course, is former senator Stephen Conroy, who was trying to push the Labor government to have freedom-of-navigation exercises through the South China Sea. But too many politicians bought the whole idea of, 'No, we're not militarising, we're just sort of colonising a couple of atolls.' Now they've parked guns, bombs, railways and airstrips there. It's a direct challenge and a direct confrontation to our wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the government is sensitive about it and I understand there are areas where they don't want to discuss it; they don't want to upset the Chinese government. But we have to bell the cat on this; if you only have one customer, or if you have a customer that effectively controls your whole production and the wellbeing of your business, then they own your business. Australia shouldn't be for sale, and this is one way we can get to the bottom of just how much of our sovereignty we've outsourced to another nation.</span>

It's similar to contributions that have been made previously on very similar references—that is, about our relationship with China, which, as has been characterised, is important, complex and engages the full range of national interests. Our government will continue to be clear and consistent in the management of our relations with China. We reject any attempts to politicise this. There's great benefit to our close cooperation with China on issues of mutual interest, including on how we contribute to regional prosperity, stability and security. We manage any bilateral difficulties from a national interest perspective on a basis of mutual respect, including on issues of sovereignty, for which we make no apology.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I would like to say that One Nation supports the motion that Australia's relations with the People's Republic of China be referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for inquiry and preparation of a report—a report into the club. We have a Liberal-Labor duopoly that is opposed to this motion—or was last week. Labor said, as I recall, that they are opposing this motion because they will get a private briefing. The government ruled that out, so what will Labor do now? Let's stand up and support an inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we see Labor prosecuting Gladys Liu over the Liu affair. Fair enough, I say. What about the donations? But there has been no reference to the substance of the material in this motion from the Labor-Liberal duopoly. Last week Senator Patrick's vote enabled the government to escape scrutiny over the Liu affair. I don't know Senator Patrick's reasons for that, but it raises questions. It is imperative that China and Australia maintain a mutually respectful and beneficial bilateral relationship, but it's imperative that that relationship is based solidly on mutual respect. Parliament needs to be held accountable with evidence and that can only come from intense scrutiny. As Senator Patrick and Senator Bernardi have said, there's nothing to be feared from such scrutiny. It can only lead to a strengthening of relationships or, certainly, a greater sense of accountability from both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you some facts that I also gave last week. It needs to be put in context, because we commend Senator Patrick for promoting this motion. China is Australia's largest two-way trading partner, export market and import source, representing 24 per cent of total trade, with a value of $183 billion. Australia is China's sixth-largest trading partner and fifth-biggest supplier of imports. Twenty-five per cent—that's one-quarter—of Australia's manufactured imports come from China, and 13 per cent of Australia's exports include thermal coal to China. A free trade agreement was signed between the two countries in June 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, China has embarked on the One Belt, One Road initiative. This is a Chinese economic and strategic agenda where Eurasia, Africa and Oceania are more closely tied along two routes, one land and one maritime. On the one hand, those who support this initiative say that it facilitates the development of infrastructure and economic aid to needy economies. On the other hand, it can be said to facilitate Chinese economic and strategic domination of smaller countries on the two routes. For Australia, we see the growing Chinese involvement in projects from northern Australia to Tasmania, all providing little benefit to Australia yet with substantial benefits to China. Other examples of Chinese involvement have been in the funding and support of local academic conferences and seminars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the ongoing issues of mutual concern relates to regional and global security. The growing tensions between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China in terms of the imposition of trade tariffs is placing Australia in a challenging position given the importance of Australia's relationships with both of these nations. Similarly, China's growing military influence in the South China Sea remains of concern, as we've already heard, to the United States of America, and that means necessarily to Australia as an established ally of America. Regionally, China is having a growing influence by funding infrastructure projects for some of the Pacific island countries and Papua New Guinea, and then we fork out tonnes of cash to try to compete. China runs the risk of changing the dynamic between Australia and our near neighbours. This needs to be understood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a destination of choice for many Chinese students to further their education in an Australian academic institution. In 2018 there were more than 166,000 enrolments of Chinese students in Australia, representing 43.3 per cent of the total international cohort, not far under half. A concern noted in some Australian universities is the potential dependence generated by full-fee-paying international students and the overall money pool available to the university budget. One university—I think it's Monash, from memory—is concerned that on one of its campuses control of the student union could be taken over by Chinese students. Nonetheless, the concern is that, should those numbers suddenly diminish, some of the universities may be left destitute, and that will hurt Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The unfettered Chinese development of five research bases within the Australian Antarctic Territory is of growing concern to many of us at a time when Australian investment in its three bases in that territory has been considered relatively conservative by comparison. Given the potential for military and strategic use of these bases by China and the potential for resource extraction at some future time, there is need to consider this factor when examining our relationships with China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a favourite destination for Chinese tourists, and this is shown by recent numbers. More than 1.3 million Chinese tourists visited Australia last year, representing 15 per cent—that's one-seventh—of total visitors. That is a clear positive for our country. At the same time, there is a growing boom of tourists heading for China, which is welcoming tourists from around the world, including 700,000 of them from Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue is human rights. That's an issue where China and Australia have competing views. We must surely understand each other there; that's critical. Australia is a democracy and a signatory to many international agreements that preserve basic human rights. China, though, is a totalitarian republic following a communist regime that is very rigid, with very little room to question the state and limited rights for the individual. One only has to turn on the news and watch the demonstrations for freedom happening in Hong Kong to see how that goes down. Many Australians remember the events of Tiananmen Square. The detention of those whose views differ from those of the regime is a continuing disgrace and worthy of further review. Currently, Australian writer Yang Hengjun is being detained in China in harsh conditions and has been charged with spying. He has published works promoting democracy and seems to be now paying the penalty for having a different point of view. He has been denied access to his lawyers and family. I will quote from an article written by Arthur Moses in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekend Australian</span>. He happens to be President of the Law Council of Australia. He says of Chinese Australian writer Yang Hengjun, an Australian citizen:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since then he has been held in harsh conditions without charge, with limited access to consular assistance. He has not been permitted to talk to his lawyers or see his family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These go to the fundamentals on which our Constitution is based, the Magna Carta and subsequent documents. Important in that is the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven, but that's not the way China runs. Yang and detainees like him, as Moses says, must be treated humanely in a fair and transparent manner. This is what I was getting to. Near the end of his article, Mr Moses says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economic future and China's economic future depend upon the rule of law in China to a large extent. That is what we need to protect and that is why we need an inquiry into our relationship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will point out some other things that I raised last week. Andrew Hastie, a well-known Liberal MP from Western Australia, recently made some strong comments about the Chinese relationship and needing to hold China accountable. Labor senator Kimberly Kitching was on the record as co-sponsor of this motion from Senator Patrick, but it seems her name dropped off. That seems to be under Labor pressure. At the moment we see the New South Wales ICAC going through all kinds of hijinks while investigating Labor. There are questions there. And then we have questions over Liberal Party interactions with Chinese influencers, and that was before the latest Liu affair, which raises more questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why hasn't the government taken more action to investigate these connections? Gladys Liu was known for raising huge amounts of cash for the Liberal Party, and now the people of Australia need to know what it would take for the Liberal Party to return any money she raised due to her links to the Chinese Communist Party. How bad does it have to get before the government asks direct questions about Ms Liu? People—not just journalists—are concerned about China and its influence over our politicians, over our politics, over our land, over our political system and over our essential services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Why was her name on a council letter?' people have asked. Why did she avoid answering simple questions? Will the Liberal Party investigate? Will it have an independent investigation? To what extent is Chinese influence controlled through donations to the Liberal Party and the Labor Party? What are her connections with the Chinese Communist Party? Is she a mouthpiece for them in this country? She couldn't recall if links of up to 12 years with two organisations connected with the Chinese Communist Party existed. This is pretty vague. She refused to state whether China's claims over the South China Sea are unlawful. These are just some notes that I wrote over a couple of days on the weekend: memory issues; vagueness; donations of a million dollars over many years, it seems in the paper; and a refusal to say that the Chinese dictatorship is in fact a dictatorship. And was she a member of various organisations connected with the Chinese Communist Party?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party won't investigate and the Labor Party runs from ICAC in New South Wales, but the people are focused on issues like landownership. Why is China allowed to buy so much land in this country, buy companies in this country and buy ports in this country? And, speaking of ports, about the port of Darwin: why did Andrew Robb, as Minister for Trade, walk straight out of the ministry and into an $880,000-a-year job with his Chinese masters? Clive Hamilton—and you rarely hear me quoting Clive Hamilton—has recently come out very strongly, exposing a number of questions about our Chinese relationship.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">China is an important trading partner and it's of important military interest. It raises security questions about our parliament, about espionage and especially about human rights. It is a complex relationship, and I think Senator Patrick did a good job in explaining that. The government has three fundamental roles: protecting life, protecting property and protecting freedom. All three need to be considered in this relationship with China: protecting life—human rights; protecting property—our property in Australia; and protecting freedom from influence, quite likely in this building and in our political institutions at the state and federal levels.</span>

We support this motion for the people of Australia and we look forward very much to seeing whether the Liberal Party and the Labor Party have the integrity and the courage to support this motion.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LAMBIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:04</span>):  The Jacqui Lambie Network supports this motion. Obviously, I've always had a lot to say about this in the past. I don't have a speech tonight, so I'm just going to say from the Australian people out there—and there are millions of them—that right now they feel like the government has put a whole heap of duct tape over their mouths and that, instead of being a democracy, they're being sent in the opposite direction. They are now getting a dictatorship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not what Aussie values are about. We have never been ashamed. We have never had fear to ask questions of others. This is not who we are. They want questions on why you're selling out our assets to the Chinese. We want questions on why you're selling our prime ag to the Chinese. We want to know why you're selling off our ports. We want to know why our infrastructure is being bought out. We want to know why our universities are being infiltrated. Let's be honest. I don't think it is a lot to ask. You owe millions of Australians some answers on this. If you think doing this is going to keep things calm, you're actually instigating more fear out there among Australians. That's exactly what you're doing out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest. I've been saying it for years and it's getting worse. I've been on the sidelines for 20 months, and all I hear is how much more they're going to spend with their cheque books to buy us up. You owe it to them to answer this. By putting duct tape on us, saying, 'Please don't do that, we might offend them,' you have millions of Australians right now feeling terribly offended by you not doing this. You need to ask yourself where your allegiances belong. That is the question you need to ask. There are millions of Australians out there that want answers. This is not the way to combat this. This will not work well. You're doing this very, very, very wrongly. You owe it to every Australian. So I'm asking you and I'm asking the Labor Party to support this, because every Australian out there wants some answers. By not giving them any, we'll only make their concerns and fears even greater. Surely that's common sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For goodness sake, let this inquiry go ahead. One way or another we'll find a way around it and we'll keep coming. I don't think that's a smart idea either. Let's be transparent. Let's be fair, so everybody else is out there finding the answers. That's all they're asking for. But right now, when you get suspicions and there's money showing up in paper bags and stuff going on in our universities with our kids, that fear factor just lifted by about 20,000 bloody degrees, I can tell you, where I'm standing. It is concerning. Australians out there want to be assured that they have got control of the situation, not the communist Chinese—which looks like exactly what we're giving them right now. This is not the way to go ahead with things. There is no room for fear here, not ever. We are a democracy. We live by our freedoms and we love them. We have no problem in saying something when we want to say it. So why have things changed? This is not on.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:07</span>):  I note that in Senator Patrick's contribution he was again critical of the Labor Party. In my contribution I would like to put forward exactly what the Labor Party's position is, and not a position that is put forward by Senator Patrick to fit his own view. Last week Senator Gallagher gave a comprehensive explanation of why Labor is not supporting this referral. Nothing has changed since then for us. What has changed is that Senator Patrick voted against a motion that would have ensured that the Morrison government explained why it ignored reported warnings from the security agency in relation to Ms Liu and her links to the Chinese Communist Party. Senator Lambie, the Greens and One Nation all voted in favour of this scrutiny. Senator Patrick, on the other hand, joined forces with Senator Bernardi to shield the government. This is despite his Centre Alliance colleague, the member for Mayo, supporting Labor's efforts for appropriate scrutiny in the House of Representatives. This has been a major dent in Senator Patrick's credibility on matters relating to China, and has created the impression that he's more interested in political hits on Labor than the national interest. It is clear that there is a strong interest in the management of Australia's relationship with China.</span>

                    </a>  I'll start again. It's clear that there is a strong interest in the management of Australia's relationship with China among members and senators. There have been many expressions of this interest, including the proposal from Senator Patrick for an inquiry. Labor notes the government will not be supporting an inquiry. We believe that the call for an inquiry reflects the broader desire among parliamentarians to be better briefed on the points of convergence and the points of divergence in Australia's relationship with China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">China is, and will continue to be, of great importance to Australia, the region and the world. The key question for Australia is: how do we best make the relationship work for us? It is reasonable and appropriate for parliamentarians to want assurance that our national interest is being served, and access to quality briefing is critical in constructive parliamentary engagement. Last month, in the interests of a calm and mature debate and the hope of continuing a bipartisan approach to the relationship, Labor wrote to the foreign minister requesting that relevant agencies such as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Office of National Intelligence provide detailed and comprehensive briefing for parliamentarians on Australia's relationship with China. Labor continues to believe this is the best approach, regardless of Senator Patrick's conspiracy theories. Labor is also establishing caucus processes for engagement on this subject, because Labor believes it is the job of all parliamentarians to protect and advance its national interest. The national interest is best served by a bipartisan approach to the relationship. This does not mean uncritical support for the government's approach; rather, it means having a sensible, calm and mature discussion without seeking to exploit complexities in the China relationship for political advantage.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:12</span>):  I thank senators for their contributions. I might work backwards through the contributions that were made, starting off with that of the Labor Party. I note on the weekend that the Labor Party issued a press release suggesting that I wasn't going to support a motion requiring Senator Cormann to come into the chamber and give an explanation, and that is not the case. As I stated when that motion was put, Centre Alliance would support the motion but we would not support the disruption of the very important business of the Senate, so we refused to support a motion to suspend standing orders.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we are; we're several months into this parliament and Labor are building up. They've started off by challenging a lone crossbencher on their failure to support a procedural motion. Let's predict what's going to happen from here. In about a year's time you might be able to stand up and deal with me on a substantive motion. In about two years time you might even be able to take on the government. That's the place you're in right now. You're in disarray.</span>

                    </a>  Well, we could talk about things like ISDS. You backflipped on that. We can talk about you standing up and saying you're not going to support tax cuts, and then you come into this chamber and capitulate. We can talk about the TEO bill, where you stood and said, 'I don't want to support that, because it is wrong in law.' We were going to stand by you. Two days before the vote, you capitulated. It was the same thing with the vegan bill last week. You knew there needed to be changes but you didn't do anything. You announced upfront: 'We're going to move some amendments. If they get up, all well and good. If it goes back to the House and it gets rejected, we're going to support it anyway.' The biggest decision the Labor Party makes at this point in time is: at what point are we going to capitulate? That's where you're at.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. So, the contribution from the Labor Party was that they said that they wanted to get briefings. The government has said they're not going to give briefings. So what are you going to do? Are you going to run a private inquiry where people can contribute privately without privilege and people don't get to make submissions? Are you going to call for submissions? Is the Labor Party going to put out a call for submissions for their private deliberations on this really important issue? That's the disappointing thing—you're supposed to be a party of government. You're supposed to take these matters seriously. We're calling for an inquiry into the most important relationship this country will have over the next two, three, four decades. Long gone is the situation where we had a strategic partner and an economic partner that was the UK and the US. That has gone, and we now need to consider properly this particular relationship. And you have failed to do this. This is another failure of the Labor Party. But do you know what? Once again, I live in hope that in about two years time you might have built up the courage to take on the government in this chamber and not direct your concerns at a crossbencher. In some sense I'm flattered, but it is really not inspiring.</span>

                    </a>  What I will say is that I always enjoy listening to him, but unfortunately the speech tonight was perfunctory talking about complexities, talking about things that we already know and not really addressing why it is the government does not want to support this motion. I find that quite disappointing.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll now go to Senator Bernardi—a crossbench contribution. I thank the crossbench for their contribution tonight. They raised a range of issues that do need to be looked at by way of this inquiry. Things like foreign students. We welcome foreign students. We welcome students from China. We welcome trade relationships. We welcome the tourism that comes from China and, indeed, goes both ways. That's all very good stuff, and part of what an inquiry might do is identify areas where we could improve things. I do note that Senator Bernardi sort of said that there is a real potential if things go bad with the Chinese relationship that it could harm our economy. But the point is, as he said, he doesn't know. And we need to know. He used the term 'flying blind'. That's how we're operating here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note Senator Lambie. She always uses slightly more colourful language. She's talking about 'duct tape over the mouths'. That's what's happening here. She's always got that sort of ocker expression that connects well with the regular Australian public, and you should be listening to what she's saying. What she's saying is that Australians want to know about our relationship. There's no-one out there saying, 'Let's not have a relationship.' We're saying: 'Let's know about this relationship. Let's understand how to maximise it and where we need to be cautious.' That's what Australians would like to know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was an issue raised today where a Chinese company, Mengniu Dairy, is going to buy Bellamy's, a dairy company that deals with baby formula. Interestingly, in the relationship between the two countries, Bellamy's has had difficulties in exporting their goods to China over the last year or so, and what that's done is suppressed the share price down to a point where we now see a Chinese owned company that has connections back to the state making a takeover offer. I'm not suggesting anything here, other than: we should take a look at these things. We should take a careful look at all of these things. Unfortunately, it doesn't look as though we're going to have the opportunity, because we've got the Labor Party saying no, despite their particular pathway to examine the relationship being cut off at the knees by Senator Payne's statement in question time last week. And we know the government's not going to support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I know there are people in government who do support this. I'm just looking. I won't verbal Senator Brockman, but I've watched with interest as he has shown intense interest in the discussion that's taken place in the chamber tonight. But, seriously, we've had Senator Fierravanti-Wells in the media suggesting that there ought to be an inquiry into China. She's a former minister in the foreign affairs space, so that's not insignificant. We know that Andrew Hastie, as was suggested by Senator Roberts, is quite interested in doing an inquiry. We also know that Senator Kitching is interested in doing an inquiry. But, most importantly, the Australian public want to examine this relationship. That's the most important thing, and this chamber should recognise that. I urge everyone to vote for this most important inquiry.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283601" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:30</span>):  I rise to continue my address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech. Before the break, I was talking about the Minister for the Environment's target to have 100 per cent of Australia's packaging re-usable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. As I said earlier, such a target is absolutely a step in the right direction, but I believe that it should be coupled with a carefully crafted program that both incentivises and pressures industry to adopt cleaner alternatives and better product stewardship, stimulating innovation where cleaner solutions are currently lacking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If products can reasonably be replaced by current alternatives, we should promote the phasing out of single-use plastics. Where this is not immediately possible, mandatory stewardship should actively drive innovative solutions for the effective disposal of waste, whereby producers or importers work hand-in-hand with business to recycle the leftover waste of these pollutants—that is, after the consumer has dealt with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the war against single-use plastics is a global one, Australia needs to play its role by confidently setting realistic standards and expectations to limit one of our major pollutants. One of the worst reflections of our global plastics problem has evolved into what has been dubbed 'the great Pacific garbage patch'. This area, with two distinct hubs—one near Japan and the other near Hawaii—is filled with garbage from activities on multiple continents. Over half the plastic in the patch comes from land-based sources, with much of the worst plastic coming from single-use items such as plastic bags, water bottles, bottle caps and foam cups. As the plastic breaks down in the sun it becomes a threat to marine food chains, as well as putting harmful chemicals into the oceans. Responsible, pragmatic actions will do more than just protect our oceans and marine life. It is only with a sense of urgency that we can ensure single-use plastics are phased out responsibly so that we can ensure a clean a future for our nation, our children and those to follow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of this government will also mean that we can reduce our carbon emissions and meet our international targets in a way that won't cost people their jobs. In my own state of Victoria, the state government's reckless energy policies have driven baseload and reliable generation out of the market and replaced it with unreliable intermittent power sources. With the closing of crucial coal-fired electricity generators in Victoria, we know that unless action is taken with improved investment in networks and reliable dispatchable power, such as natural gas generation, Victorian households and small businesses will face a future of higher prices and blackouts this summer. The state government's moratorium on natural gas exploration and production is changing Victoria from an energy-rich estate to an energy-poor one. This poses an enormous threat to our manufacturing industry, including, for example, Portland's aluminium smelter in south-west Victoria. The Victorian state government is following a recipe for disaster. We have seen in South Australia what happens: record high prices and black-outs. This government will do what it can to keep the lights on in Victoria and drive prices down. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on this side are not against renewable energy. It is the balance with reliability and cost that concerns us. We are focused on implementing practical and real energy policies, not unworkable and economy-destroying policies. The coalition government has set down its plan for Australia. As a new senator in the 46th parliament, I support this plan. As I said in my maiden speech last week, I restate my commitment to represent all Victorians and to listen to ideas from all sides of the political divide. I look forward to serving the people in my home state and I thank the senate for its indulgence. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:35</span>):  I listened closely to the Governor-General's speech. I had laid a wager with myself as to whether climate change would get a mention in the speech. Somewhat to my surprise, it did. It was only a short mention, and it repeated some of the deliberate errors that the government and government representatives use when talking about climate change, but it is worth acknowledging that it got a very small mention. Then I got to thinking about how that very small mention of climate change in the Governor-General's speech actually related to the reality of the situation that we're grappling with. In May this year the Secretary-General of the United Nations described climate change as an existential threat to humanity. I'll say it again: an existential threat. In other words, our survival as a species is at risk. The survival of everyone currently living on this earth, the survival of future generations who are yet to be born is at risk, according to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. But what happened then, after the Secretary-General of the UN described climate change as an existential threat to humanity? Well, in a living, breathing demonstration of cognitive dissonance, life just went on in this place. There was a flurry of media stories for a couple of days, and then journalists' attention, with a couple of honourable exceptions, went elsewhere, and the caravan moved on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the honourable exception of the Australian Greens, there are no senators or members of parliament in this place continually prosecuting the arguments for strong action on climate change. We're facing an existential threat, and yet the debate rolls on to the favourite and pet topics of other members, the things which journalists think are important but which actually pale into absolute and utter insignificance beside the issue of climate change. We have a situation where on ABC News, after the news and before the sport, you get a couple of minutes on the economy. Well, the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment. If you don't have a functioning ecology, if you don't have a functioning climate, you don't have an economy. Why is it that media outlets are not reporting on this with the seriousness that it deserves and demands? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it that we get an update on share prices, not an update on parts per million of CO2 equivalent gases? How can it be that our major media outlets and our major political parties have so badly lost their way that they are not concentrating the overwhelming majority of their efforts to fight this existential threat to humanity? How can it be that, with our survival as a very species on the line, we are not getting wall-to-wall media coverage and we're not getting wall-to-wall debates on the issue of the breakdown of our climate?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at that, when you look at the reality of the situation versus the way it's reported and the way it's treated in this parliament and in parliaments around the world, you can convince yourself that it might be because of political donations—because big fossil fuel companies pour so many millions of dollars into the coffers of the Liberal-National party and the ALP in this place. But that doesn't explain why our media is so asleep at the wheel. It doesn't explain why journalists run off on flights of fancy, concentrating on the soft-porn politics that make up so much of the media coverage in this place, when in fact there is a looming crisis and a threat to the very existence of humanity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we were fighting a war with another country now, we would have a war cabinet made up of people from across the political spectrum, and that war would be the subject of endless and consistent debates in this place. But when we're faced with something far more serious than a war with another country, when we're facing what the Secretary-General of the United Nations has described as 'an existential threat' to humanity, apart from the Australian Greens, it's the sound of crickets in here; and, apart from a few honourable exceptions in terms of journalists and in terms of media outlets, it's the sound of crickets in the mainstream media. It's not good enough, and I say to the major parties and the rest of the crossbench, and I say to the majority of journalists and media outlets who operate in this building or anywhere else in this country: you are failing people. You are letting people down, because you're not reporting the biggest story in humanity's history—the way we are fouling our own nest and the way that we are placing billions of lives at risk and, ultimately, the way we are threatening our own future as a species, our very existence as a species.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The one thing that gives me hope in all of this abrogation of responsibility, amidst all the venality, all the self-interest and the narrow self-absorption that rules the roost in this place, is the kids who are going to come out on Friday for their School Strike 4 Climate and say: 'Enough is enough. We're not going to be silent. We're not going to go quietly into the night. We're going to hear what the science is telling us. We're going to reflect on the view of the Secretary-General of the United Nations that we are facing "an existential threat" to humanity by breaking our climate down around us.' Those brave, courageous children are going to step out there on Friday and say, 'We will not be silent.' Well, power to their collective arms. They put to shame the majority of people who purport to represent Australians in this place. They are showing more courage, more awareness and a far greater understanding of the calamity that is looming and, in fact, of the breakdown of our climate that is happening right now, right around us, as I speak in this chamber tonight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to all senators, to whatever capacity you have, when we next get a Governor-General's speech can we please have a speech that reflects the science? Can we please have a speech that reflects reality? Can we please have a speech that reflects the truth that the Secretary-General of the United Nations was telling when he said in May this year that climate change is an existential threat to humanity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283585" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:46</span>):  I too rise in reply to the Governor-General's speech in this place on the opening of the 46th Parliament. In the 122 days since the election, this government has provided certainty and stability. On 18 May, the Australian people had a critical decision to make: to stay the course with tried, tested and trusted economic policies or to venture down the path of reckless and blatant socialism. As the Prime Minister has said: you've seen a plan, a plan that we took to the Australian people, a plan that we put in our budget, a plan that foresaw the challenges that Australia was going to face, and a government that's steadfastly getting on with implementing that plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision by the Australian people resulted in our nation being led by a stable, united government getting on with the job with a clear plan delivering on the promises it made versus a Labor Party now conflicted on policy and tarnished by scandal. It's about certainty versus uncertainty, stability and practicality versus chaos and confusion, on work over welfare, border protection over union power and economic policies where the only certainty and consistency are on this side of the chamber. We on this side are a united, strong and disciplined government because the Liberal Party of Australia, the party organisation responsible for our election victory, is also strong, disciplined and united.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As at April 2019 more than 1.3 million more Australians are in jobs since this government was elected. Nearly 60 per cent of those jobs have been full-time jobs. There were 413,800 more jobs created in 2017 alone. That is the highest number of jobs in any year on record. Over 100,000 more jobs for 15- to 24-year-olds were created in the 12 months to June 2018. That is the strongest result of any financial year on record. It is a record that we as a government are very, very proud of. The unemployment rate is now 5.2 per cent. When Labor left office unemployment was at 5.7 per cent and rising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Governor-General spoke in his speech of the plan that we have as a government. We are working to build a stronger economy. Through welfare-to-work the percentage of working-age Australians on welfare has fallen to 14.3 per cent, the lowest rate of welfare dependency in 30 years. In 2017-18 there were 90,000 fewer working-age Australians on welfare than there were in the previous year. Think about that: these are figures, but they're not just numbers on a page. These numbers represent the lives of real people, real Australians who are now able to provide for their families and for themselves to provide a better future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're backing small businesses as well. Tax relief is being delivered for businesses with an annual turnover to $50 million. We have record infrastructure investment, with $100 billion being invested over the next decade. The Governor-General spoke about efforts to fix the budget. Labor racked up $240 billion in deficits over six years. Without action, debt would have been on track to head towards $1 trillion—a massive handbrake on the economy. We've halved the growth in spending from four per cent per year under Labor to 1.9 per cent—the most restrained of any government in 50 years. We've delivered the first budget surplus in 12 years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is tax relief for working Australians. We are making taxes lower, simpler and fairer. In 2018-19 around 4.5 million Australians will get tax relief of $1,080 per year. Over 10 million taxpayers will get some tax relief. Our legislated plan means that after six years 94 per cent of taxpayers will pay no more than 30 cents in the dollar. We're boosting exports. Australia's exports increased to a record $438 billion in 2018, up from $307 billion in 2012-13. In 2018, Australia had a trade surplus of over $22 billion. We're providing more opportunities for Australian businesses with China, Japan and Korea as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We've signed the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations and agreements with Indonesia, Peru and Hong Kong. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on, with the work we've done with industry and defence. The previous Labor government ran down our Defence Force and failed to commission a single ship from the Australian shipyard for our Navy. We're building 54 new naval vessels, and this will boost Australia's Defence Force and create thousands of new skilled jobs. We're investing in skills, with over $525 million in the Delivering Skills for Today and Tomorrow package. This will create 80,000 new apprenticeships in areas of skill shortages. We will lay the groundwork to deliver a stronger skills sector well into the future. The government invested over $3 billion into the VET sector in 2018-19. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Liberal Party's campaigns across Western Australia. The results across the state were outstanding, as they were in your home state, Madam Acting Deputy President Stoker. In fact, in Western Australia, we had the strongest results in the country, seat by seat, in the face of a socialist campaign of those opposite which did little to resonate with the voters in my home state of Western Australia. In particular, I want to pay tribute to a few candidates that we had in seats that we didn't win. In the seat of Brand, we had an excellent candidate, Jack Pleiter, supported by the chair of that campaign, Mihael McCoy. They were able to achieve a swing of 4.77 per cent towards the Liberal Party in that seat. Jack was a great candidate—a local guy, a builder, a small business owner, a great representative of our party—and he did a terrific job. I want to pay tribute to him and his efforts. In the seat of Burt, we had a swing of 2.12 per cent, with a great candidate in David Goode. I was a candidate there in 2016 and I know the area very well. David was able to achieve an even better result than I was able to achieve only three years earlier. He was supported by Stephen White, the manager of that campaign. An outstanding effort was put in by David Goode. In Cowan we had Isaac Stewart, supported by Dean Smith, the chair of that campaign, and Gary MacLean, who supported him as well as being manager. We just missed out in Cowan. Isaac was an amazing candidate; he put so much work in and he took so much time off work to contest this election. I want to pay tribute to Isaac and the effort and the work that he put in. In Fremantle, we had a swing to us of 0.6 per cent. Nicole Robins was our candidate there—a local schoolteacher. She was a great candidate—someone who represents the values of the Liberal Party so well. She was supported by Paul Connolly and the chair of that campaign. Again, they did a great job right across that electorate. It's my home electorate. It's where I live, and I spent many an early morning at train stations with Nicole campaigning for that seat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to pay tribute to Jim Grayden in the seat of Perth and the chairs, Victoria Jackson and Jeremy Quinn. Jim and his wife, Tammy, are amazing people. They're true representatives that typify the spirit of the Liberal Party. They gave so much of their own time and their energy and their efforts. I single these people out because I've been given this opportunity to be here in this place because of the efforts of all of our incumbents but also those who ran in really difficult seats. I'm here, not just because of my own strength and my own efforts, but because of the support of the Liberal Party right across the state, including these wonderful candidates. I hope that this will light a fire in their hearts and in their minds, and that they will be inspired to go again and, hopefully, be victorious at a future date.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great honour for all of us to be here, and we have a tremendous task ahead of us over the remainder of this term to implement all that the Governor-General spoke about in his speech. I look forward to working with the Morrison government to see the delivery of everything that was laid out.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:56</span>):  I rise to respond to the Governor-General's speech, which lays out the plans of the Morrison government. I have the greatest respect for His Excellency General the Hon. David Hurley, having served in the defence forces at the same time as he did. I know his career very well. So I'm going to be very careful in saying that we all know in this place that the speech of the Governor-General was, in actual fact, the government's speech. It's where the government laid out its plans for this parliament. I've looked at the speech. In fact, I sat in the chamber and listened to the speech and I looked for the gems, and I couldn't find them. So, I went back to my office, I printed the speech and I looked through it again and again. I was just trying to find the vision in there. Unfortunately, it's lacking. There is no vision in there. There's nothing in there that would inspire Australians into thinking that the Morrison government has got its hand on the tiller, its hand on the thrusters and that it's going to drive our country to the great place it needs to go to next. It's not in there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are bits in the speech about tax reform. I get that tax reform was important. I went to a number of briefings from Treasury, I talked to the ACCC and I talked to the Reserve Bank governor, and it was necessary for us to have personal tax cuts. I think Australians deserve to be able to spend more of their own money, to keep more of their own money, and, indeed, it does help to stimulate the economy, but it's not vision. It's not that excitement that we want. Australians want to wake up and say, 'I feel like the government's heading in the right direction.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are things in there like regulatory reform and industrial relations. I'm sorry, but that's housekeeping. It's important, but it's housekeeping. The topic of jobs came up, and my ears pricked up because I know how important jobs are to Australians and how important it is that every Australian has the opportunity to have a job. I was looking for some vision in the speech. I was looking for the way the Governor-General would describe how we are going to advance our country. All I got was a story about training and apprenticeships. Once again, they're important things, but they're housekeeping. They're the obvious things that we need to be doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Home ownership: I also get that home ownership is important, and some measures were announced about home ownership. Infrastructure: there are some good things in the speech about infrastructure—railways, airports and highways. But do you know what, Madam Deputy President Stoker? It doesn't matter which government is in power, those things are going to happen. Health, again is important, mental health is very important and the NDIS is even more important, in some respects. But they're all very much housekeeping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education is the very thing that one would think is key to a forward-thinking nation and a nation that wants to get on top. I looked in there, and education was talked about but there was nothing in the speech that talked about what we were going to do with those educated people. It was missing. There were also veterans' affairs, security and foreign policy. Now, foreign policy is not about housekeeping, it's about looking at our neighbours. Once again, it's important, but there wasn't anything in there that I could grab onto.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on and repeat the Governor-General's speech, but I can assure the chamber that there is no vision in there. We can pick up this speech and shake it as much as we like, but no vision will fall out from between the pages. That's my difficulty with the speech that the government has presented in respect of the 46th Parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of things that could have been in there which could have excited Australians about what it is we're going to do. There could have been talk about how we are going to be manufacturers and how we are going to give incentives to companies to grow, to expand and to invent. In the recent inquiry on intellectual property—and that legislation will come before this chamber perhaps in the next sitting week—we learned that something like 1.44 Australians in 10,000 have a patent to their names. In the United States it's in the order of 10 and in China it's in the order of 22. That says something about how we want to approach our future. It says that we are not doing enough to encourage invention or to encourage the generation of intellectual property that could ground Australia moving forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been having a look at just one aspect of economics that we need to consider that wasn't in the Governor-General's speech: the resource companies around Australia, particularly in oil and gas. I've looked at them as they come to our country and take our resources. They give very little back; they pay very little back in tax. People would be surprised at how much Equinor pays back to the Norwegian government. It's a national oil and gas company. Around the globe there are many national oil companies, such as Petronas in Malaysia. I could name a whole range of different countries and I've started to have a look at what these companies contribute to their countries, and it is billions upon billions. In the case of Equinor it's tens of billions that they contribute back to their own country. What we seem to do is invite multinationals to come here and set up shop—and, I give them credit, they create jobs, but Equinor does that in Norway and around the world as well—but they don't pay any tax; they don't contribute to our society. They do pay PRRT, but we know that's broken, and the order of magnitude of what they pay is nothing like what other overseas entities with national oil and gas companies pay back into their taxpayers' consolidated revenue. So that's just an example of where the government could be thinking and exploring those sorts of things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another place where the government could have offered vision relates to another aspect of resources. One of the problems we have here in Australia—and this is no reflection on the very hardworking people that work in the mines around this country—is that we export rocks. We export iron ore; we export lithium and uranium, for example. We export all sorts of things. I'm being agnostic as to the resource that we export, but we don't value-add to those resources. We have large lithium reserves. Basically we have 60 per cent of the world market in lithium in a world hungry for lithium ion batteries. Every one of us in this chamber has an iPhone or a Samsung or some sort of mobile phone device that uses a lithium ion battery. All of our future cars will use lithium ion batteries. Hopefully our future submarine will have lithium ion batteries as well, although I fear that we'll end up with lead acid cells. Our homes will have wall banks with lithium ion batteries. The world is jumping onto this technology, and what are we doing? We dig the lithium out of the ground in the Pilbara and ship it offshore. There are five stages of processing in the production of lithium ion batteries. The first stage is mining and concentration, which will have a world market total in 2025 of around $12 billion. So, if we had the entire world market, we'd have $12 billion worth of exports. The next stage is refining and processing, worth $41 billion. Then we move to electrochemical processing, worth $297 billion; cell production, $424 billion; and battery assembly, $1.3 trillion. But what are we going to shoot for? We're going to shoot for something less than $12 billion as we export these rocks. The Governor-General's speech I was looking for was the one that said, 'Let's value-add. Let's take those resources that we're digging out of the ground and do something with them. Let's add the value which creates jobs and employment, generates economic activity and would make Australia a very rich country.' But no, we're going to ship it offshore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have the same problem with our steel. We have lots of iron ore in this country. Unfortunately, we're struggling in terms of steel manufacturing in my home town of Whyalla, which is on the cusp of going in a couple of different directions. I hope it goes big. Wollongong has certainly improved its business outcomes over the last few years. But we could be doing a lot more, except we're not even looking at that. We've got to build up our manufacturing. We've got to build up these capabilities where we add value to the economy. Right now we take the rocks and send them offshore and other countries develop the technologies. They add the value and sell it back to us at a much, much higher price. Some of those countries we're a bit concerned about. We're a bit concerned about how they're expanding their reach into the region. We're concerned about how they're exercising soft power. We're concerned about how they're growing their armed forces, but in some sense we're funding it. We're funding it because we're just exporting the rocks for them to add the value to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went looking in the speech for something that's going to tell me how we're going to turn Australia around. Right now we're coasting along. I can't remember the exact phrase, but there's a quote from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lucky Country</span> that says, 'Australia is a lucky country whose luck is shared by the very ordinary politicians that run it.' Apologies for misquoting that, but that's the general theme. We need to do a lot more. I love Australia. I love this country that I live in. I was born in New Zealand. I came here. I love this country. I want to see it prosper, and I want to see it grow. Unfortunately, when I look into this Governor-General's speech, looking at the government's plans for the future ahead, there's nothing in there that excites me, and that concerns me.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281697" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:10</span>):  In rising to speak, I note that this is not my first speech. But I do appreciate the opportunity to speak to the ambitious plan that the Liberal-National coalition government has for Australia over this term of parliament, and it's unfortunate that Senator Patrick's not excited, because I certainly am.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I speak to the coalition government's plan, I want to acknowledge those who helped the coalition to achieve its third consecutive term in government. I consider myself incredibly privileged to have joined the Senate at this year's federal election, an election in which the Nationals recorded a particularly impressive result. And I take this opportunity to single out our party's leaders, the member for Riverina and Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Michael McCormack, and Senator for Victoria the Hon. Bridget McKenzie, for their efforts in achieving this result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together with their team, Michael and Bridget worked tirelessly with our parliamentarians, candidates, members and volunteers across Australia to secure the Nationals' terrific result. State by state, seat by seat, they worked effectively to communicate the Nationals' plan for building the infrastructure and delivering the services that are needed to grow rural and regional Australia. And the result? The Nationals retained all of our seats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, contrary to what many in the media and those on the opposition benches were predicting. But our celebrations have been short lived, not because we're not pleased to be here but because we are focused not on ourselves but on delivering for our communities throughout rural and regional Australia, and we get straight to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition took a bold infrastructure plan to the election, and the voters endorsed it resoundingly. Building roads, rail links and airports—that's what we need to grow regional Australia, and that is what is at the heart of our government's agenda. I am very proud to say that the centrepiece of our government's hundred billion dollar infrastructure pipeline is Inland Rail, a once-in-a-generation project that will transform the way freight is moved around Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of New South Wales, rural and regional communities are already seeing the benefit from this transformational project. Earlier this month, track work near Parkes in Central West New South Wales was completed. This link is just the start of the connections Inland Rail will forge along its 1,700-kilometre route between Melbourne and Brisbane. More than 70 Central West businesses are supplying products or services, and more than 280 local people are working on the project across a range of jobs, including engineers, tradespeople, labourers and administration staff. In total, around 700 people have already worked on the Parkes to Narromine section of the rail alone, and these figures will keep growing as the project moves into each stage of construction. The north-west connection will link Inland Rail to the interstate east-west line from Sydney to Perth, providing a vital connection for the freight industry and ensuring we have sufficient connections from regional Australia to domestic and international markets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the benefits of Inland Rail don't end there. This project is opening up opportunities for regional businesses, manufacturers and farmers, enabling them to grow their exports by helping them to get their produce to market when and where it is required. And there are boundless future opportunities to get industry processing and manufacturing away from the urban fringes and out to the regions, where they face lower costs, more space and less congestion. The Inland Rail project will support 16,000 jobs during construction and will provide a $16 billion boost to our national economy over the long term, helping to build resilience in our economy going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our plan for rural and regional Australia goes well beyond infrastructure. We are doing everything we can to support the continued growth of our current $60 billion agricultural industry, which we hope to grow to $100 billion by the year 2030. Agriculture, on which so many livelihoods and jobs in rural and regional New South Wales depend, is still and always will be a vital pin in our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the north of my home state the current drought is the worst on record, and in the south it is doing everything it can to beat the millennium drought. This government is not turning a blind eye to the devastation of the current drought. We've already taken action to help our drought-affected communities. We are investing over $6.3 billion in drought support. Since the introduction of the farm household allowance in 2014, nearly 12,000 farmers have received assistance through this initiative, and almost 7,000 are receiving the payment now. We've also listened to feedback from those who the farm household allowance is designed to support. We've taken action to streamline the process, reduce red tape, get more financial counsellors on the ground and increase the asset threshold to $5 million to allow more people to access the allowance. We're also going beyond the farm gate. Through the Drought Communities Program, 52 local government areas in New South Wales alone are delivering infrastructure projects and activities to boost their local economy and get money back into the local regions to support local jobs and address local community needs during this drought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also looking ahead. The coalition has already legislated the establishment of the Future Drought Fund, which will provide a secure and continuous revenue stream to be used for drought resilience, preparedness and recovery, to help farmers and communities prepare for future drought. Being based in Deniliquin, between the Murray and Murrumbidgee irrigation districts, I know firsthand what our farmers, businesses and communities in rural and regional New South Wales are experiencing and just how important the establishment of a long-term drought strategy is. And that is what the Future Drought Fund is designed to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our support for those in the agricultural industries doesn't end there. We're also prioritising the safety of our farmers and farm workers, who've been targeted by animal activists over recent years. With the passage of the Criminal Code Amendment (Agricultural Protection) Bill 2019 just last week, the coalition government have already delivered on our election commitment to take a tough stance against those who trespass on farms and threaten farmers and their families. These new laws send a very clear message to animal activists: if you intend to incite trespass, property damage or theft on agricultural land or associated industries, you risk imprisonment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also beyond the farm gate, right throughout our regional communities, improving telecommunications services remains a priority of this government. Through our Mobile Black Spot Program, the creation of which was championed by the Nationals, we continue to address black spots throughout rural and regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also announced our intention to amend the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's charter to make sure that the great institution that is the ABC, which plays such an important role in the bush, remains relevant and accessible to rural and regional Australians. The ABC occupies a special place in the lives of regional communities. Over many decades and still to this day its services have informed and entertained in areas where other media options are limited. Indeed, my day continues to start, every day, listening to my local ABC rural report, although now I don't have to rely on radio and I can listen to it live streamed. Through the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment (Rural and Regional Measures) Bill 2019, we will deliver a range of measures to support and cement the important role of the ABC and ensure the ABC continues to meet the diverse needs of rural and regional Australia. As a result, hopefully we will see a change in focus—a little less Ultimo and a little bit more Ulladulla or Urana.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is also committed to improving the health of people living outside our cities. We have 13 new cancer centres to be opened in the regions and more than 3,000 new doctors, and the same number of nurses, to be supported into regional and general practice in the coming decade. Each year one in five Australians over the age of 16 experience mental illness, and for young people that rate is even higher, affecting just over a quarter of all Australians aged between 16 and 24. As the only New South Wales senator based west of the great divide, this is an issue I care passionately about. In the rural, regional and remote communities of New South Wales, access to mental health services and professional support is limited. While there is a great commitment there by our professional allied health industries, it is difficult to sometimes get the help you need. There is so much to love about the country's lifestyle, but the reality is that each and every day people living in the bush face a range of stressors unique to living outside capital cities, and we need people to understand. That's why the government is investing in improving mental health services across Australia, including rural and regional communities. Almost $740 million will be invested into youth mental health and suicide prevention services, with 30 new headspace centres to be opened across Australia. The success of headspace cannot be understated, and this service does succeed in reducing wait times while making more counselling services that are specifically tailored to young Australians available to young Australians. The coalition government has an ambitious plan for rural and regional Australia, and over this term of parliament we will deliver that plan—indeed, we already are. We are delivering new infrastructure, we are investing in services and we are caring for those who need it most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to restate my appreciation to all those who played a role in helping the coalition, and indeed the Nationals, secure the result that it did at this year's federal election, particularly the hundreds of volunteers of the New South Wales Nationals who came out to support us in the lead-up to and on election day. For many years, many have been predicting the demise of the Nationals, but instead, in just 26 days time, the New South Wales Nationals will begin its centenary year—one hundred years of delivering for rural and regional Australia. Our party's longevity is due to the efforts of our members and our volunteers. In campaigning for the Senate, I ventured far and wide across New South Wales, travelling both sides of the great divide, from country to coast; north to south. I saw firsthand our members and volunteers hard at work helping our members and candidates fighting hard to secure another term in government for the Nationals in coalition. Without their efforts, we would not have the enormous privilege of serving the government and delivering on our agenda for growing rural and regional Australia. To our members and volunteers, I say thank you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:23</span>):  Never before have we had a Prime Minister, a cabinet and indeed a whole government so focused on improving life for people outside of capital cities and, more importantly, building the wealth of Australia by increasing the GDP from our productive regions. Remote, regional and rural Australians are big winners from the Morrison government's economic and expenditure plan outlined in this year's budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many obvious differences between life in the city and life in the country, but it is the things many of us take for granted that really matter in regional areas and are to determine if people, young people and families stay. The Australian federal government recognised this and has acted. We've committed $220 million for the first four rounds of the Mobile Black Spot Program and an extra $160 million for rounds 5 and 6 as part of the Stronger Regional Digital Connectivity Package. That's a total of $380 million. These four rounds are funding the delivery of 1,047 new mobile base stations. As of today, 744 new base stations have been activated and are delivering real benefits to Australian communities. There is, of course, more to do. And that is coming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the telecommunications reform package legislation due to be tabled. It aims to promote competition and improve access to broadband services for everyone, especially those in regional, rural and remote areas. This package establishes a legal guarantee that all Australians can access super-fast broadband regardless of where they live or work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms also include the introduction of the Regional Broadband Scheme, which will secure a long-term funding mechanism for NBN Co's fixed wireless and satellite networks, predominantly serving regional Australia. The universal service obligation ensures that all people in Australia, regardless of where they live or carry on business, have reasonable access to voice services via standard telephones and pay phones. Telstra is funded annually by the government and the telecommunications industry levy, $170 million and $100 million respectively, to deliver the USO and will continue to do so until 2021. And, if passed, the Telecommunications Reform Package will include the introduction of the Regional Broadband Scheme, the RBS, which will secure a long-term funding mechanism for NBN Co's fixed wireless and satellite networks, again, predominantly servicing regional Australia. This will provide funding certainty for essential broadband services currently provided by NBN Co in regional parts of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sky Muster Plus, launched on 12 August this year, addresses concerns about restrictive data limits in regional and remote locations. The $60 million Regional Connectivity Program is the other key component of the Stronger Regional Digital Connectivity Package. It includes a $53 million competitive grant program to address local telecommunications priorities in regional, rural and remote areas; $3 million for a digital tech hub to address and improve digital literacy; funding for trials of alternative voice technologies for Australians who live in the most remote parts of the country; and funding to investigate better ways to deliver the universal service guarantee, particularly for the delivery of voice services in regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've talked a lot about connectivity, but why is it important? Last week, the AgriFutures Australia, ably led by the Hon. Kay Hull, held its rural women's award. Jo Palmer was this year's winner, carrying on from the extraordinary work of Krista Watkins last year. Jo Palmer's award was for a really interesting project. Her business connects women who've moved into regional Australia—women with qualifications who are currently being underutilised—with businesses which are able and prepared to have remote workers. Jo estimates that with a six per cent increase in rural and regional women's engagement, it would increase productivity for the nation by $25 billion a year. Surely this is a program that we need to support, but it can't happen without terrific internet connectivity that allows these jobs and these women to hold these jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional and remote communities will also benefit from more affordable and reliable power under the Morrison government's plan to support to installation of microgrids, which are standalone power systems that can maintain a connection to the grid or operate off-grid. The Regional and Remote Communities Reliability Fund will support up to 50 off-grid and fringe-of-grid communities to investigate whether establishing a microgrid is cost effective and whether existing off-grid capabilities can be upgraded with modern technology. The $50.4 million fund will unlock private sector and community investment in new generation and storage. The fund will also guide communities towards additional support, including through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is taking action to drive down prices by increasing competition and supply in the market. Unlike Labor, who have abandoned regional Australia, we understand the importance of investing in our regional and remote communities to ensure future energy supplies. We have proven this by providing a grant of $990,150 to Daintree Renewable Energy Pty Ltd to help the Daintree community in Far North Queensland establish Australia's first solar-to-hydrogen-based microgrid. As I said, the government will also support up to 50 off-grid and fringe-of-grid communities to continue investigating these microgrids. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Regional and Remote Communities Reliability Fund is part of the Morrison government's $2 billion plan to deliver power that is more affordable and more reliable to Australian families and businesses. This is critical. Australia has committed a huge amount to renewable energies, far more per capita than other economies. But now we have to utilise those investments and ensure that communities have reliable and affordable baseload electricity. I think it is probably hard for those of us who live in cities to understand the frustration of having the electricity go off every time you turn on the oven or turn on another air conditioner in your local community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other budget measures set aside especially for regional Australia include federal assistance grants to local councils. The coalition has already boosted grants to Queensland councils by $10 million in 2019-20 to more than $250 million. The grants also include a separate road-funding component of $73.4 million. This is critically important. Councils, large and small, form the core of our society, but regional, rural and remote councils are doing it particularly hard. It is crucial that the FAGs that are currently allocated have some sort of mechanism to allow remote communities to receive more. They have ageing sewerage infrastructure, they have ageing community infrastructure and they have a very small population base over which to spread that, so they will require greater support from the federal and state governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have the Northern Australia Beef Roads Program, worth $100 million, which will build prosperity in the country's interior by making it easier and safer for tourists and communities, and for cattle to get to market. This is part of a wider roads program worth more than $14.5 billion for regional Queensland roads and transport over the next four years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've already spoken a little bit about the importance of regional and rural economies. Just recently, the Productivity Commission handed down a draft report where it discussed whether or not the zone rebates and FBT incentives have been worthwhile for the Australian economy. I would say to you that we should support zone rebates and any other incentives that make it easier for businesses and individuals to live in regional Australia. They are an important part of encouraging and supporting families and individuals who live in communities that have higher costs of living and are further away from large communities but are great places to live and raise families, and, of course, great places to have businesses, particularly in food production.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In north-west Queensland this year, floods wreaked havoc on cattle production but more than $3.3 billion has been paid or committed to assist affected people, businesses and communities with recovery and reconstruction through the north-west LIRA program. This includes over $87 million paid to 1,632 primary producers in special disaster assistance recovery grants; $300 million for North Queensland restocking, replanting &amp; on-farm infrastructure grants; and $121 million in assistance to be paid to the Queensland government under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The relief in that part of Australia, not only due to the money but also due to Scott Morrison's personal care, is still keenly felt and won't be forgotten. As I travelled around Northern Queensland recently I met with people in Mount Isa, Winton, Richmond and Hughenden who came up quietly and wanted me to personally take their thanks back to the Prime Minister. They wanted me to tell him of their gratitude, not just for the funding—which of course was important—but most importantly they wanted me to tell him how grateful they were that he had sent them a message that he and Australia still valued farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the coalition is the only government looking outside the city and seeing the worth of regional, rural and remote Australia. But we don't only talk about it; we back it up with real consultation, real spending and real action, because regional people matter.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:36</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Overseas Welfare Recipients Integrity Program) Bill 2019. The Liberals still have cuts to the pension in the budget. They want to completely take away the pension supplement from pensioners who go overseas for more than six weeks. This will see around $120 million ripped from the pockets of pensioners. They still want to make pensioners born overseas wait longer as well before qualifying for the age pensioner by increasing the residency requirement from 10 years to 15 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has fought these cuts tooth and nail, and this is the only reason that the Liberals and the Nationals have flip-flopped and given in. No-one spends five years, including three years as Treasurer, trying to cut the pension and increase the pension age to 70 unless they really believe it. This is why pensioners know they can't trust the Prime Minister. There is one simple fact: no matter who the leader of the Liberals is, cutting pensions is in the Liberals' DNA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we saw again a glimpse of the Prime Minister's disdain for older Australians. On the weekend, we read reports that the number of over-55s who receive Newstart has increased by over 45 per cent under the Liberals and Nationals, a staggering 58,313 since the Liberals took office. One in four Australians on Newstart are aged over 55, the single largest cohort of recipients of the allowance. Older Australians experience particular difficulties in re-entering the workforce due to structural barriers and age discrimination. Older Australians who are desperately trying to re-enter the workforce are asking themselves, 'How is the cashless card or a drug test going to help me get a job?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the Prime Minister's plans for jobs? What are this Prime Minister's plans for the economy? The reason why this Prime Minister is reheating old ideas is because he has run out of ideas. Rather than stimulating our stagnant economy and easing the situation for older Australians who have fallen on hard times, the Prime Minister is more interested in subjecting them to humiliating urine tests. How is it that the Prime Minister spends so much time obsessing and devising ways to humiliate and prod older Australians who are trying to re-enter the workforce and yet he has no plan for jobs and no plan to boost an economy that is getting weaker every day that he is Prime Minister?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:39</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Overseas Welfare Recipients Integrity Program) Bill 2019. This bill introduces a requirement for people receiving income support payments who are 80 years and over and living overseas permanently for at least two years to provide proof-of-life certificates. It affects people receiving the age pension, disability support pension, widow B pension, wife pension and carer payment. This includes people whose payment has an unlimited portability period under the Social Security Act and people receiving a payment under one of Australia's international social security agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill requires people to provide proof-of-life certificates once every two years at a minimum. The proof-of-life certificate requires an authorised person to verify that the person is alive. The certificate must be certified by an authorised certifier, which could include a judge, magistrate, medical doctor or authorised consular staff at an Australian embassy, consulate or high commission. Aside from giving these general examples, this bill does not define who can be an authorised certifier. This is left to be clarified in a legislative instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill, a person has 13 weeks to return a proof-of -life certificate from the date they are given notice by the secretary. If they do not return the certificate or enter Australia within 13 weeks, the income support payment will be suspended for a period of up to 13 weeks. If they fail to comply during the suspension, the income support payment will be cancelled. A person who has had their payment suspended or cancelled is eligible to receive back pay once they provide a proof-of-life certificate. However, they are only eligible to receive back pay for up to 39 weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I'm very concerned that people over the age of 80 living overseas are going to struggle to receive their proof-of-life certificate from the department in the mail. What if they changed their address and forgot to notify Centrelink? What if they are incapacitated in a hospital for a long period of time? What if the mail system in their country of residence doesn't work as effectively as the Australian system? I also have strong concerns that Australians aged over 80 will be threatened with payment suspensions and cancellations as a way of enforcing compliance. The bill will subject some very vulnerable people to payment cancellations, all because they are living overseas. The strict 13-week deadline means that pensioners could face hardship as a result of losing their income support payment. The onus shouldn't be on older Australians to prove they are still alive. We should have better ways of keeping track of income support recipients through Centrelink. My office has been assured that there will be no debts raised from people who have had their income support payment cancelled as a result of noncompliance. I would like to ensure that the minister verifies that this is in fact the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are currently around 96,000 Australians receiving income support payments while living permanently overseas, with most of these people receiving the age pension. Some 24,900 are over the age of 80. The government predicts that only 6,000 people over the forwards will be affected by the bill. In the scheme of things, this is a very small number of people to be chasing for some meagre savings to the budget bottom line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under current policy the government has two ways of being notified of an income support recipient's death. Firstly, the government relies on the recipient's family to notify them of their family member's death. Secondly, Australia has reciprocal death reporting agreements with countries like the UK, where data on deaths is shared between the two countries. However, it is possible that family members mistakenly believe they are entitled to receive income support payments after the recipient living overseas has died. This is understandable, because in some countries a person's spouse or dependants are entitled to receive payments after the recipient's death. It seems to me that if families are unsure of the rules around payment eligibility, the government should be prioritising a public education campaign for income support recipients overseas and their families, instead of this rather onerous legislation. Instead of putting the onus on older Australians on income support payments living overseas through the proof-of-life certificates, the approach should be one of education and ensuring that processes are in place so that Australia does get that notification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Greens will be supporting this bill, I have some concerns about this approach to target overseas people on income support and how this process could potentially impact them, particularly through the introduction of these rather onerous reporting requirements and compliance measures. The implementation of this legislation should be monitored to make sure that there isn't an inordinate number of people receiving income support payments—age pensioners in particular, because the bulk of these people are age pensioners—who start to drop off income support not because they have passed away but because this system is not working as intended. I will be keeping a close eye on it and seeking from the minister in her summing up statement a response to the issues that I raised for clarification.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:45</span>):  This bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Overseas Welfare Recipients Integrity Program) Bill 2019, implements a measure announced in the 2018-19 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook to confirm that Australian pensions are being paid only to overseas pensioners who are still alive. Voluntary third-party reporting, such as by family members, is the primary method by which the Department of Human Services learns of the death of an overseas pensioner. Data shows that there is a disparity between the death rates of pensioners aged 80 years and above overseas and in Australia. This disparity is significantly large enough to suggest that DHS is not being notified in all cases or in a timely manner when a person dies overseas. Analysis of a sample of pensioners overseas in a target group highlighted that many of these pensioners go years without further contact with the Australian government. In some cases this has been more than 20 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change will help to protect the integrity of government outlays for welfare payments overseas, ensuring a fair and sustainable welfare system. The introduction of a proof-of-life process will also bring Australia into line with international practice. Because Australia is a multicultural country, with a large proportion of Australians having been born overseas, the government recognises that many people choose to return to their country of birth upon retirement. However, there is some confusion with some pensioners and their families overseas that Australian pensions can be inherited by partners or family. This misunderstanding is compounded when a person is concurrently receiving pensions from Australia and another country where the other pension may remain payable to a widow or widower. There are approximately 96,000 age pension, disability support pension, widow B pension, wife pension and carer payment recipients currently residing permanently overseas. Of these, approximately 25,000 are aged 80 years and over, and they live in around a hundred different countries. The top five countries of residence are Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Spain and New Zealand. Australia has international social security agreements with 31 countries that allow people to claim an Australian pension while living overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is estimated that this measure will identify approximately 6,000 pensioners aged 80 years and over who are deceased and still receiving payments overseas. This measure is expected to save around $219 million from 2019 to 2023 as a result of identifying deceased pensioners earlier. Pensioners aged 80 and over and residing permanently overseas for longer than two years will need to complete and return a proof-of-life certificate every two years in order to continue to receive their pension overseas. To help protect against fraud, the certificates will have to be verified. Pensioners will have a range of options available to have their certificate verified so as to make their process as easy and practical as possible. Pensioners will be given 13 weeks to respond to the request. If there's no response their pension will be suspended for up to 13 weeks. If they still haven't responded after this time—26 weeks in total—their payment will be cancelled. Should they make contact and provide their completed proof-of-life certificate after this time their payment will be able to be reinstated without requiring the pensioner to reclaim. A pensioner who has their payment reinstated will be paid any arrears to which they're entitled. Provided a pensioner responds and provides their completed proof-of-life certificate within 39 weeks of the initial request being sent, they will be able to receive full arrears. Life certificates or proof-of-life requests are commonly used for pension eligibility confirmation by European countries—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  Just prior to my maiden speech, during the winter break I undertook a two-week regional and rural listening tour of my home state, because on this side of the chamber we take the concerns of the people living in regional Queensland seriously. I had the opportunity to meet with community groups and not-for-profits such as the Royal Flying Doctor Service, mayors and councillors from our state regional councils and of course lots of farmers and small business people. Being a Chinchilla boy, the country is and will always be in my heart. During my two-week trip around Queensland, I visited Toowoomba, Dalby, Chinchilla, Roma, Charleville, Quilpie, Tambo, Emerald, Mackay, Bowen, Townsville, Ingham, Innisfail, Atherton, Cairns, Gladstone, Rockhampton, Yeppoon, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Country Queensland is doing it tough, and it's not just the drought to which we can apportion blame. The decline in rural manufacturing industries has been made worse by Labor's continued war on our farmers. The Palaszczuk government are continuing to erode our farmers' property rights. From their prescriptive land-clearing laws, they have now turned their attention to Queensland's coastal farmers via the Environmental Protection (Great Barrier Reef Protection Measures) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. The Palaszczuk Labor government's anti-regions, anti-farmer and anti-jobs agenda will see agronomists, extension officers and even chemical and fertiliser resellers required to keep, and produce on request, records of advice, products and services supplied to growers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland's rural coastal communities are particularly reliant on the sugarcane industry. Queensland's $4 billion cane industry employs more than 22,000 in direct and indirect jobs throughout the state, and the majority of them are in regional towns. I had the pleasure of meeting with board members of the Mackay CANEGROWERS when travelling through town. The sugar industry is already doing it tough, with low international prices for sugar putting pressure on the viability of existing cane farms and mills. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A key aspect of the Queensland government bill is the harvesting of farm data. Under the amendments, extension officers and even chemical and fertiliser resellers will be required to keep, and produce on request, records of advice, products and services supplied to growers. Sugar mills will also be required to hand over data on request. Another aspect of the bill is provision for further regulation. The bill provides the Department of Environment and Science's chief executive with the power to make a standard and to review and change it at any time without sufficient consultation or accountability. While the chief executive must consider submissions, there is no requirement for them to account for the impacts of any changes on the farming sector or the regional communities it supports. In effect, the regulatory goalposts can be shifted at any time. Further, there are restrictions on land use. Under the bill, growers will be required to obtain an environmental authority licence to grow cane on their own land if that land has not been cropped for three of the previous 10 years. Where a licence is required, growers will need to show they can manage water quality risks through farm design and practice standards. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key aspect of the bill is expansion into southern districts. Should the government's proposed amendments be approved by parliament, growers in Queensland's southern growing regions of Bundaberg, Isis and Maryborough, who are already struggling with drought and soaring electricity prices, will face reef regulations for the first time. These unfair reef laws proposed by the Queensland Labor government have been met with huge backlash from industry groups, including CANEGROWERS, AgForce, the Australian Banana Growers Council, Growcom and the Queensland Farmers Federation. I'd just like to quote some comments by the Growcom CEO, David Thomson, which I think really touch on the vibe of what's happening out there in regional Queensland:</span>

The ABGC has described the incoming laws as devastating.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers are our best environmentalists. These proposed laws follow on from Queensland Labor's vegetation management legislation. They continue Labor's war on farmers. The Palaszczuk Labor government continue to treat regional Queenslanders like second-class citizens. It was obvious the Queensland Labor government were scared to debate the bill during the recent regional parliamentary sitting in Townsville from 3 to 5 September. I call on the Queensland state government to think again and drop these big brother laws and instead start investing in long overdue infrastructure projects, such as dams and power stations, to get Queensland moving again.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:58</span>):  In July this year, the Family Violence Counselling and Support Services North Adult took industrial action with concerns about the lack of budget allocation to their services in relation to resourcing and staffing their Family Violence Counselling and Support Service statewide, and the subsequent impacts on the service delivery capacity and the impact on staff wellbeing. The core work of the family violence counselling and support adult program is to provide counselling information and support to some of Tasmania's most vulnerable people. The program provides a vital first response to victims of family violence after police reports, self-referrals and consult referrals concerning family violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These staff are dedicated professionals who provide a specialised support service. The provision of services by Family Violence Counselling and Support Service are unique in the continuum of services to family violence victims. It is often the first point of contact for those who have a police response and for those engaging with services for the first time. It is essential that they have the capacity to meet and to provide a high level of services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Family violence is often committed by a person against their spouse, partner or ex-partner. Family violence can include physical abuse; verbal abuse; emotional abuse; sexual assault; threats of violence that may include stalking, coercion and intimidation; financial abuse; contravening a family violence order or an interim family violence order; and assaulting a pregnant woman. The work of the Family Violence Counselling and Support Service may involve informing, counselling and support; providing information and support to family and friends; arranging for assistance from the police; providing assistance in finding a safe place to stay; assisting in accessing limited financial support; making referrals to Legal Aid and/or court support; acting as an advocate in assisting with Housing Tasmania and Centrelink; liaising with the government and non-government sectors on behalf of their clients; and participating in weekly case and coordination meetings with other Safe at Home providers. Currently, the services of the Family Violence Counselling and Support Service provide a statewide extended-hours service from 4 pm to midnight seven days per week. This extended-hours service provides intense support in the crucial initial period following a family violence incident when other services are not available. The support provided to victims through this service includes such things as counselling, information and support. It can provide victims with the knowledge and confidence they need to report incidents of family violence. This timely support is crucial to promote help seeking and engagement for victims. Research shows that a timely response to victims post-incident is the most effective intervention. In Tasmania no other service support is available to victims. The Family Violence Counselling and Support Service provide an intensive support service to victims of family violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that family violence has a devastating impact on the health and wellbeing of victims. In Tasmania there's been a significant increase in reported rates of family violence since the inception of the Family Violence Counselling and Support Service in 2005. In the year between 2005 and 2006, there were 2,417 referrals to the adult program. In 2018 there were 6,126 referrals made. This equates to a 200 per cent increase in overall referrals to adult programs statewide. However, despite the increase in demand, the staffing profile has seen a reduction in full-time staff. In 2017-18, the budget of $200,000 per year for two years was committed to meet the additional demands to the Family Violence Counselling and Support Service. The staff were advised that $110,000 would be used to fund a shortfall in the service, which then left only $90,000. There is not much that can be done with $90,000, I can tell you, and as a result the services have had to be cut. A decision around the allocation of money was made with no discussion with staff, which created disappointment in staff as they know that they will be left with the fallout of more work in less time, which puts their own health at risk. And we know what the burnout rate is for these positions. From the added $200,000 there's been no additional staff for the extended-hours service, which plays a pivotal role for those people requiring support and services when leaving a violent situation. Concerns have been raised by staff around their reliance on the one-worker model and how it creates a significant health and safety risk to them being able to perform their role. A risk assessment was completed, and, as a result, staff would have different roles and would not have face-to-face contact with clients but would be doing all their contact over the phone. This change has given staff of the Family Violence Counselling and Support Service concern as it would mean increased workloads and a less personal experience when dealing with vulnerable people leaving an abusive and violent situation. Staff also feel there will be a significant risk impacting on client outcomes and a reduction in the service available to victims and families of domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Community and Public Sector Union, on behalf of their members, have highlighted that to the Hodgman Liberal government and have made commitments to eliminate family violence, to protect the most vulnerable and to keep all Tasmanians safe and free from violence. However, a recent internal service audit has identified that increasing demands for Safe at Home services are compromising the assistance response capacity, and current service delivery is not sustainable under the current resourcing arrangements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania, the Hodgman Liberal government keeps saying that eliminating family violence is a top priority. Mr Hodgman, the Premier, has even appointed himself as Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence. His first act in his new portfolio was to announce his government's three-year action plan on family and sexual violence. The problem with the Hodgman Liberal government's plan is that they have not provided any extra funding for family violence counselling and support services. The Liberal government have no care for the daily stress of staff working as counsellors and the stories that they hear each and every day. There is a human element. These workers at the forefront are at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder, having to go home each night feeling that they have let people down, as they cannot do as much as they would like to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to make the Family Violence Counselling and Support Service work, a commitment is needed from this Liberal government to put a plan into action and to demonstrate it is seriously listening to staff who know what working with limited resources really feels like—staff that go to work each and every day and give 110 per cent in helping to eliminate domestic violence, and to back up and support those people fleeing domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While this is a matter relating directly to Tasmania, domestic violence is not something that is isolated to our area. In Australia, one in three women and one in five men have experienced at least one incident of domestic violence from a current or former partner since the age of 15. We all know the statistics; there're really very alarming. But what we need is more action from the Liberal government in my home state and from this federal Liberal government to ensure that there is adequate resourcing to eliminate the risk of family violence and to ensure that there are people who are going to be able to give that face-to-face service that those fleeing domestic violence so desperately need. We have very dedicated, professional people that are giving the best of themselves, but the governments needs to ensure there is adequate resourcing available for them. It is one thing to give lip-service; it is another to ensure that there are adequate resources available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />We know that in 2010 the federal government, in partnership with the states and territories, developed a 12-year national plan to reduce domestic violence, but it is not clear if any of those strategies are actually working. The national plan's vision is an Australia free from all forms of violence and abuse against women and children. We're nearly at the end of that 12-year plan, yet the number of people being referred to services for help with family violence has only increased. Unless we have appropriate action, unless we do more than just give lip-service to reducing domestic violence, the number of people, women and children predominantly, that are leaving very violent situations will only increase, and those people at the forefront who give them the support they so desperately need will get burnt out, and they are so badly underresourced— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:08</span>):  I rise tonight to speak about the threats posed to our rich marine environment in Western Australia. The Ningaloo Reef is one of the world's last healthy coral reefs. It is home to over 700 reef fish species, 300 documented coral species and 650 mollusc species. Ningaloo is a haven for dugongs, turtles, manta rays, orcas and humpback whales. Each year, around 300 to 500 whale sharks congregate in the reef area. In 2011, the Ningaloo Coast was inscribed on the World Heritage List in recognition of the outstanding values of the area's diverse and abundant marine life and amazing cave fauna. I've been part of a longstanding campaign to protect Ningaloo Reef, and I understand the area well. Sadly, this precious reef is under threat again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just around the corner from Ningaloo Reef itself is the Exmouth Gulf, which is a rare and precious estuarine system that was much underrated in the past. However, a recent study by the University of Western Australia and Oceanwise Australia revealed the incredible biodiversity of the Exmouth Gulf. The research has found the estuary is home to more than 1,800 fauna species. The gulf is also an important nursery for a range of vulnerable and endangered species. It supports the endangered juvenile hawksbill turtle species and is one of the world's most significant whale nurseries. The gulf has played an essential part in the recovery of humpback whale populations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lead researcher of the study, Dr Ben Fitzpatrick, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Exmouth Gulf is even richer and more significant than we anticipated. In terms of bony fish alone, it has nearly twice as many species as Ningaloo Reef, which is a World Heritage Area …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Exmouth Gulf's diversity is unique to Western Australia's Pilbara and globally important for the conservation of sea life, especially threatened species. However, the study warns that there is still much that we do not know, and calls for further scientific research and more funding to better understand this previously understudied area. We know that the area is spiritually important for the local First Nations people, and that it supports sustainable activities such as ecotourism and fisheries. However, the threat of climate change and coastal development can jeopardise this finely balanced ecosystem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These issues aren't the only threats to the gulf. A multinational corporation called Subsea 7 is proposing oil and gas pipe fabrication in the Exmouth Gulf. The pipelines will be towed straight through the calving and resting grounds for humpback whales. They will also be dragged through the World Heritage Area of the Ningaloo Reef. The oil and gas pipes would pose devastating risks and put pressures on the marine and terrestrial environment. We must protect the Exmouth Gulf, which is home to a significant ecosystem that must be protected for its biodiversity value. The government needs to act to protect this precious area from industrial development, and the Exmouth Gulf, which has been ignored for so long, should be included, as it should have been all along, in the Ningaloo World Heritage site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Down the coast from the Exmouth Gulf and Ningaloo Reef is another special area, which I have spoken about in this place before, and that is Shark Bay—a place extremely close to my heart. Shark Bay is another critically important marine environment located 800 kilometres north of Perth, in the Gascoyne region of WA. Having been heavily involved in the campaign to have Shark Bay listed as a World Heritage site, I have a fairly good understanding of the values of this area and I want to ensure they are protected. Shark Bay is one of the handful of World Heritage properties around the world that meet all four natural criteria for listing. In particular, its vast seagrass beds are the largest and richest in the world. It provides an important habitat for fish and marine mammals. This includes five species of endangered mammals and globally significant populations of the endangered green turtle and the vulnerable dugong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this area is critically important for endangered species and that it is threatened by climate change. In 2009 a federal government report outlined the potential effects of climate change on Shark Bay. It predicted that rising sea temperatures would mean that marine life moved south. Two years later, in 2011, Shark Bay suffered from an intense marine heatwave. This catastrophic marine heatwave destroyed 900 square kilometres of seagrass, which was 36 per cent of the area's total coverage. Many of the areas that were covered with seagrass are now bare. What's more, Shark Bay could now be transitioning from a subtropical to a tropical marine ecosystem. Those who know that area will know that it's the boundary of that subtropical and tropical marine ecosystem, which is part of the reason why it's such an important area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A 2018 workshop convened by the Shark Bay World Heritage Advisory Committee found Shark Bay had the highest—the highest!—category of vulnerability to future climate change. This means extreme marine heat events were classified as 'very likely to occur', while the capacity of Shark Bay to adapt to heat events was very low. The threat from higher intensity and more frequent climatic events in the future only underscores the problem. People across the world have heard of the devastating coral bleaching suffered by the Great Barrier Reef, yet few people have heard of the devastating impact of the marine heatwaves threatening our World Heritage ecosystem in WA forever. This is unacceptable. Australia has an international obligation to protect, conserve, rehabilitate, present and transmit to future generations the World Heritage values of Shark Bay. It is our responsibility as a signatory to the World Heritage convention, an issue that Australia understands given we have so many areas of World Heritage value on the list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just over a week ago we had National Threatened Species Day, which should remind us all about the extinction crisis in this country. Exmouth Gulf, Ningaloo Reef and Shark Bay provide the habitat for many threatened species, yet we are not taking the threat of climate change in this country seriously enough. Our governments have failed us in the past and they continue to fail to address the implications of climate change for these absolutely critical habitats and ecosystems. We need to see action before we see more species driven to extinction. We must do more to protect our precious places across Australia from the threat of climate change and industrial development. We need to invest in further research in Exmouth Gulf and Shark Bay so we can properly understand these ecosystems, understand the impacts of climate change and invest to protect these areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, we need to listen to the younger generation, who are out there talking about climate change. They know the risks. They are calling for change. So, again, I encourage everybody to turn out on Friday for the strike, because it's our young people who see the dangers. They are standing up for these environments. They are standing up for the planet, for threatened species. They are saying: 'Take time out. Attend the strike. Show you care for the planet, show you care for these environments and show you care that this government and future governments take action now to stop places like Shark Bay and Exmouth Gulf from disappearing forever.'</span>
