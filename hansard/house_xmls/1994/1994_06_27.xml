The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) has not indicated whether that procedure has been followed in this case.

         —The government's view on this matter has already been stated clearly by the foreign minister in the Senate last week. It is no doubt inevitable that issues between the two countries such as the recent issue of press closures are issues on which we will disagree. But I think the broader issue is the nature of the relationship and how difficult issues within it are managed. I said today on radio—let me repeat it—that Australia has been forthright in putting its views about liberty, freedoms and human rights in Indonesia and in other parts of the world. But we still maintain broad relationships with countries like China which have state control of the media, and with countries like Malaysia which have a very substantial degree of discipline over the media. Because of the breadth of those relationships, that is as it should be.

         In respect of Indonesia, the government has said it was disappointed by these closures. As Indonesia changes, as it continues to grow, as incomes continue to rise, as wealth continues to be distributed, as the nature of its economy continues to be outward going, there will be changes in the way in which Indonesia is managed. Some of those stresses and strains will show up in matters such as these. The point is that I will be seeing President Suharto tomorrow. Again, I am not in the business of saying to the Leader of the Opposition or to the media in Australia what I will say to President Suharto before I see him.

         —I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his question. Of course, the training wage is a very significant development and part of the armoury of this government in fighting unemployment. I am pleased to report to the honourable member that significant progress has been made on agreement to, and, therefore, speedy implementation of, the training wage. Last Tuesday I met with employers. At that meeting we ironed out most of the wrinkles as they perceived them so far as the training wage was concerned. I had a further meeting on Friday where all the wrinkles were ironed out, I am pleased to say. Employers have now unanimously agreed to the rates as previously negotiated between the ACTU and the Metal Trades Industry Association—and, of course, involving the government—but, importantly, they have also agreed to the detail of the award. This has to be contrasted with the in-principle agreement that employers gave to the training wage soon after the government's white paper was announced.

         The meetings last week were attended by a significant group representing the peak bodies of employers in this country. Not only was the Metal Trades Industry Association present; so were the Australian Confederation of Commerce and Industry, the Business Council of Australia, the Victorian Employers Confederation of Commerce and Industry, the National Farmers Federation and the Retail Traders Association. All have now agreed unanimously with the government's position.

         The significance of the training wage is fourfold. Firstly, for the first time it will introduce an adult training wage. Secondly, it will simplify the complexity of rates now applying to youth in this country. Importantly, it will base the rates on competencies and qualifications achieved; they will not be based on age. The third important area is that the training which qualifies for this wage can be training done on the job. Therefore, it will enhance the thrust to enterprise bargaining and the significance and relevance of an enterprise's training needs. Fourthly, we have streamlined the process, through the establishment of the body called Nettforce, whereby the red tape has been cut.

         So the meetings that I have held with employers have been numerous and they have been constructive, although you would be forgiven for believing that the whole training wage was about to collapse, from the newspaper reports of a little over a week ago. The shadow minister seemed to be relishing the thought that it would collapse—paying lip-service to the concept of a training wage but doing absolutely nothing constructive to achieve it. This is a government not just about developing good policy but prepared to get involved in the nitty-gritty of implementing it.

         The training wage is a milestone achievement for this government. It will help propel the skill formation agenda of this country, which is essential to avoid skill blockages. It will certainly help the long-term unemployed get back into work. It will significantly and far more effectively match employer requirements for skill formation with the available skills of the work force or, if those skills are not there, with the mechanisms in place to ensure that they are brought up to speed. I commend this initiative to those on the other side of the House. I hope they get behind supporting at least one dimension of the government's policies.

         I said this on the last occasion there and if I get asked about it again, I will say what the government's policy is. The notion is, `You can mention the government's policy at home but don't mention it abroad.' That is, `Don't go and say that the aim of the government's policy is that by the year 2001 Australia will become a republic with an Australian person as our head of state.' That is the government's policy and I will say it wherever I think it advances Australia's interests.

         —I thank the honourable member for her question. I am sure many honourable members would be aware of the changes that President Clinton has announced in the United States. From our point of view, the announcements that he has made serve to highlight just how much headway we have made in this whole area over the last few years. There is a range of proposals, the most controversial of which is a time limitation on the availability of so-called welfare support. A range of other proposals is bound up with President Clinton's proposals. These include trying to achieve a national system of child support, which in some ways would be analogous to the one we have already achieved here, and focusing additional amounts of assistance in the form of labour market program assistance to help sole parents get back into work. Again, in both those areas there have been some very significant achievements in this country.

         It is worth making the point that there are important demographic and social differences between our circumstances and those of the United States. When thinking about whether it is appropriate or justified to have a time limit on income support for sole parents, it is worth bearing in mind that the policies we have put in place—designed to increase the self-sufficiency of sole parents—have been very successful. The jobs education and training program is a very well-structured and effective program to help sole parents. As a consequence of this and the child support scheme, we have actually been able to reduce very significantly the proportion of sole parents on the maximum rate of sole pension. It has gone down from around 84 per cent in 1983 to around 50 per cent now. That reflects the combined impact of our labour market interventions and our child support scheme.

         As honourable members would be aware, the child support scheme has been operating over the past six years and, since 1988, very significant achievements have been made. Around $450 million has now been directed through that scheme; around 70 per cent of that goes to the benefit of sole custodial parents and their children, and a significant part of the remainder goes back to the taxpayers in the form of reduced social security outlays. The proportion of sole parents receiving child support has gone from around 26 per cent at the beginning of the scheme to around 40 per cent now. There has been virtually a doubling in the number of sole parent pensioners declaring maintenance.

         All in all, very considerable results have been achieved, given that we do not think it is appropriate to contemplate some sort of time limitation on access to these payments. We consider that would be highly inhumane. Also, in the light of the results that have been achieved, which have resulted in bringing down the average duration on the sole pension to around three years in this country in any case, it would be particularly inappropriate to contemplate the sorts of proposals that are being considered in the United States by way of a time limitation.

         As to the other measures in the Clinton package, as I said, we have already made very substantial headway in those broad directions. The net effect of that is to achieve a very significant improvement in the living standards of sole parents caring for children. This is an area of major achievement for this government in which I think we can justly take pride.

There is no doubt that skittishness in international markets has impacted and does impact into the Australian bond markets.

         There has been a view, particularly in the face of very low nominal and real interest rates in the United States, that monetary policy needed to be shifted. But I made the point the other day—I think it is worth making again—that, at their lowest point, interest rates in the United States fell to three per cent. That is the federal funds rate, the official rate. The official rate in Australia, the cash rate, fell to 4 3/4 per cent. That is 1 3/4 percentage points above where the United States' rates were. They are bumping up now against capacity constraints in the US in the labour market, certainly in the trained labour market, in the product markets and with plant and equipment. There has been a view in US markets that this will reflect in higher rates of inflation. This has permeated world markets and has had an impact here.

         As I said the other evening, interest rates here for business lending are somewhere between 6 1/2 and nine per cent, with a real rate of something like 4 1/2 to seven per cent. Even  if one were to take the gloomy view and say that inflation will be higher than two per cent in an underlying sense and, say, three per cent, a real rate of 3 1/2 or six per cent is not easy money. That is the point the Treasurer has made and the point I have made continually and consistently.

         What the Treasurer said is that as the recovery picks up and there is a call on savings by the private sector for plant and equipment and other forms of investment, in every other recovery the price of funds has risen. He is talking about them rising in this context not because of inflation getting out of control, but simply because of pressure on funds for resources.

         —The honourable member for Bennelong says, `It has happened,' making reference to the two banks that have shifted their rates. There is a lot of competition in the retail banking sector these days and, as a consequence, some rates are decidedly lower than others. If, in the funding of those loans, a bank decides that its fixed lending rate should rise from 6.9 per cent to 7.4 per cent, I think, in the case of one, I do not think the opposition is entitled to say, `Shock, horror! The end of the world is coming.' Some books will be cast differently and, as a consequence, the lending policies of some banks will be different. Therefore they will lift their rates, but official rates have not risen.

         The key point is that official rates have not risen. They have not risen because the government believes that inflation has been checked and that, from the official statistics, it has actually been decelerating. In that context, falling in with some sort of market sentiment from the northern hemisphere which says that inflation is going to be out of control, when we have just agreed to another two years under the accord of $8 to hold inflation in check means that the government will not be responding to pressures in the bond markets which are induced from other markets.

         I noticed over the weekend that the Leader of the Opposition got together with several of his frontbenchers on this question and they decided that it was time the opposition started to get behind Medicare. They recognise what most other people have known for a long time, and that is that it is a very popular program. The reasons that people give for supporting Medicare are the ones that we have always endorsed—that is, that it helps low income earners, covers everybody regardless of means and location, and provides value for money.

         —The first observation I make is simply this: it is only this side of the House that has the policy to keep wages in check. That is point one. We have done so for the eleven years of the accord. In most years we have had the wages outcome—that is, the national accounts average weekly earnings—at below the budget forecast, so the accord and its management have outperformed the official forecast for the year.

         We recently concluded a further arrangement under accord mark 7 to adjust the bottom 20 to 25 per cent of the work force by two $8 per week increases. The rest of the work force will be adjusted by enterprise bargaining, giving Australia the kind of wage flexibility that, as with everything else, only a Labor government would have done. Whether it is deregulating the financial markets, or opening up the exchange markets or the product markets, or knocking the tariff wall over, or opening up telecommunications, or fixing the ports and wharves, in the labour market, as always, all the hard jobs get left at our door. Again we are seeing that sort of flexibility now running through the labour market. As a consequence, we are seeing wages maintaining low inflation.

         The point I made the other night was this: if you say to the work force, `Look, let's be in a national objective of restraining inflation', which the business community accepts and the work force accepts, and in a sense there is a compact on this, and we have inflation down, but then one of the markets that boast concern about the inflation rate—the bond market—says, `We don't believe that inflation has been defeated in Australia; we don't believe the national resolve; we are factoring in higher inflation,' and that ends up, as some of them would like it, reflecting in nominal interest rates and housing interest rates, why would any person in the work force say, `I've made my contribution'?

         Interest rates are now rising. One of the principal points of low inflation is low interest rates. If the work force contributes to low inflation but does not get the low interest rates, what is it left with, if interest rates are to rise inexorably, other than to say, `This is the cost of living and we'll recover it in the marketplace'? Apparently the shadow Treasurer cavils at that notion. He thinks there is something fanciful about it. That is because he does not understand how the labour market and the economy work. If he had had a decade of wrestling with the double digit inflation bequeathed to us by our predecessors and getting it down in the context of wage tax trade-offs and productivity related wage bargaining, he would have some sort of deeper and incisive understanding about the relationship between wages, inflation and interest rates, and the role of interest rates in the economy and society, particularly in terms of wage costs.

In any recovery, one would be recreant of one's duty not to keep a weather eye on wages—and we will—to see that, where wages are accompanied by productivity, we can be confident that the inflation rate is going to stay where it is. But where there are wage increases which are paid without a connection to productivity, the government will keep an eye on that. It is the government which has brought inflation in Australia back to and below the world average of our trading partners. It was never the coalition, which found itself unable to deal with inflation from the mid-1970s onwards.

That was the policy—and as far as I know it remains the policy—of the federal opposition.

         Over and over again, after years of cutting public sector outlays in this country to where they now lie, I have said that people who believe that they can cut just on two per cent of GDP from outlays are deluding themselves. It would mean the absolute destruction of the social security system, the social welfare system, the transfer system and the education system as a consequence. It would be impossible and unthinkable.

         The government took remedial action on the receipt side of the budget last year. Let me remind honourable members opposite that, in a totally unprincipled way, they opposed every such change in the Senate and attempted to defeat them. As a consequence, receipts to GDP—and their equation with outlays—will lead to an outcome which the government forecasts will be better now than the deficit of one per cent of GDP by 1996-97.

The budget trajectory is travelling down to below one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. All the Treasurer said is that even if, for instance, the recovery gets to the point in a couple of years from now where it is putting real pressure on resources, we will always keep fiscal policy under notice. I should have thought that to be a pretty unexceptional statement, a thing that any rational government would do. But having already put those receipt side measures into place, particularly with fiscal policy travelling down the way we expect, there is a nice balance between monetary and fiscal policy. That is the point I thought he wanted to make and, I thought, he made it well.

        This is not the first occasion on which key US figures have praised the tripartite nature of Australia's industrial relations system. It was earlier this year that Dr Ray Marshall, a senior member of the Dunlop commission—which happens to be the commission set up by President Clinton in the States to study labour market reform—said after studying our system that the US could learn particularly from Australia how to make it very difficult to pursue low wage policies.

It is against this background that the federal coalition continues to advocate its Jobsback policy, the policy that gives all of the worst aspects of the old system in the United Kingdom and the old existing system in the United States, a system that provides no safety net at all, that provides a policy vacuum and a recipe for wage slashing and industrial conflict. The opposition's domestic role model is the Victorian IR system, the system that has now seen almost 400,000 workers resign from state award coverage and come across to the federal system. Only last week the Victorian Employee Relations Commission, that is the commission set up by the Kennett government, itself went to the extent of disowning the system.

         I also restated Australia's enduring commitment to working with Pacific Island countries to help secure the future of the region. At the same time, I suggested that the end of the Cold War and the rise of APEC presented the region with very changed international circumstances and new challenges and that we were facing increasing social and economic problems which needed to be urgently recognised and addressed by the countries themselves in partnership with Australia. I said that Australia did not seek to impose its own solutions to regional problems, or that those problems were easily identified or not different between the separate countries, but that the Pacific Island countries themselves should accept greater responsibility for putting in place the kinds of policies and programs which were needed to achieve sustainable economic growth. That is important to maintain the support of donors and, equally, to attract quality foreign investment over the long term.

I noticed just today that the Papua New Guinea Minister for Forests was reported to have said that his country is losing more than $1 1/2 million a day from illegal logging exports.

At that meeting regional leaders will discuss in a more focused way the opportunities for sustainable development in those countries.

         —My question is directed to the Prime Minister. It relates to answers given to questions to him earlier this year. Inquiries to the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority confirm that the company, Brown and Hatton, will be prosecuted under the Clean Waters Act for two separate acts of pollution at Parkville between August and October last year. You were the half owner of the company at the time. You must know that the excess effluent from those piggeries at Parkville runs into Kingdon Ponds, which supplies the city of Scone with one-third of its water supplies, and eventually runs into the Hunter River system. Why, in answer to questions from me on 9 and 21 February, did you mislead the parliament saying that the Parkville piggeries had not contributed to any pollution when you, a half owner, were aware at the time of the instances to which I am referring? Do you still claim that what you said in the House was true when the EPA is now saying that you were aware of the investigation at the time?

           The parliamentary zone represents the heart of the national capital and belongs to all Australians. The parliamentary zone is a major focus for tourists in the national capital. Visitors come to see their Parliament House and those other institutions and monuments that have been largely established and supported by government revenue.

          This was the first public inquiry the committee has undertaken in relation to the parliamentary zone. On 21 December 1993 the then Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), wrote to the committee referring to it a proposal by the National Capital Planning Authority, the NCPA, to install new parking signs and voucher machines within the parliamentary zone. The work was required for the implementation of pay parking within the zone. Pay parking was the method proposed to raise some $4.3 million of a total program of $19.3 million for the restoration and replacement program of national capital assets.

Without exception, all people and organisations who made submissions to the inquiry addressed the broader range of issues raised in the NCPA's proposal. This meant that the impact of the installation of signs and equipment was considered as well as the wider issues raised in the works proposal.

          All of the institutions in the parliamentary zone were concerned about the impact of the proposal on tourist numbers and the detrimental effect on visitor enjoyment of national institutions.

          Some important Australian institutions could be financially disadvantaged by the proposal. The committee felt that insufficient attention had been paid to allaying the concerns of the major institutions in the parliamentary zone. The committee was also concerned about the possible impact of the proposal on the many volunteers who willingly give up their time to assist in the operations of some of Australia's most important institutions.

          The committee received submissions from many people who work in the area. It was noted that no guarantee by the NCPA had been given that improved public transport links would be created to ensure an adequate service into the zone at peak periods. Also, in examining the works proposal, the committee was concerned that the revenue targets were unlikely to be achieved without a significant increase in the rate of charges for pay parking, which would be disproportionate to the commercial value of the parking sites. In addition, there is no guarantee that at the end of the restoration program the funds raised from the parking charges in the parliamentary zone would continue to be spent on national capital assets.

          Consequently, the committee has recommended that parliamentary approval, as required under section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, not be granted for the proposal to install voucher parking machines and associated signs in the parliamentary zone; and that the National Capital Planning Authority, in consultation with other relevant departments, investigate alternative means by which additional funds could be raised to offset the cost of the restoration and replacement program of national capital assets.

          —I would just reinforce the comments made by the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth). This was a relatively trivial inquiry, but many honourable members will be familiar with the fact that issues of this kind generate a lot of attention even though they are not of central importance, and we received a surprising number of submissions.

          I would begin by thanking the committee staff for their work, as I am sure the chairman would have done if he had been given the time to do so. The work on this inquiry was very professional and thorough, and the drafting is an excellent summary of the issues. The chairman has summarised those points very well and I would also thank him. But let me just reiterate a couple of the very important ones.

         The Parliamentary Zone represents the heart of the National Capital, and belongs to all Australians.

         It was in that context we were looking at this inquiry. It is important that all the institutions within the parliamentary zone—the parliament, of course, but also the other institutions: the National Library, the National Art Gallery, the High Court, and so on—be freely available to people. To introduce pay parking seemed to us inconsistent with that goal. As well, the chairman has mentioned other issues that concerned the committee. We were not at all impressed with the idea of the introduction of voucher machines. We thought that they would not in any way enhance the aesthetic value of the area; in fact, we thought they would detract from it.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We were concerned about the issue of who should pay for improvements. Of course, there needs to be improvements and maintenance in the area, and it is entirely appropriate that funding for those tasks come out of general revenue. It seems inappropriate that simply those who work in the area or those who volunteer to help at those cultural institutions, such as the gallery and the library, should be expected to pay for what is really a national asset. As the chairman has already said, we were not convinced with the revenue estimates and were quite deeply concerned that a modest level of parking fee, the introduction of which was proposed, would very rapidly become a larger one. We thought that there had not been adequate thought to alternative modes of transport through the area, and we believe that also needs attention.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          It is very important to note that there are alternative methods of funding improvements, other than just general revenue, if that is what the government really wants. A very obvious way of doing that would be through charging some kind of fee directly to the institutions which are located in the area. For example, charging rental for land in the parliamentary zone would be a very logical way of funding improvements and maintenance of infrastructure in the area.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In conclusion, I think the committee has made a very sensible recommendation. I fully expect that the government will accept it and take seriously the need to maintain well the beauty of the central area of the national capital, an area of which all Australians can be proud and, I think, most are. We should look for ways of enhancing that improvement rather than detracting from it.

           ASIO and security assessment: a review of security assessment procedures
          </emphasis>
          —is the result of a reference to the committee from the previous Attorney-General in the last parliament which was referred again by the present Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in May 1993. In total, five public hearings were held, two in 1992 and three in 1993. Submissions were received from 29 organisations and individuals, and evidence was taken at both public and incamera hearings from agencies such as ASIO itself, the Attorney-General's Department, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Security Appeals Tribunal, the Administrative Review Council, the Privacy Commissioner and the Merit Protection and Review Agency.

          The report traces briefly the historical background to ASIO's present role in security assessment; from its establishment in 1949, through the royal commissions headed by Mr Justice Hope in the 1970s and the 1980s, to the present. In its examination of the issues, the committee came to several early and fundamental conclusions: firstly, that it remains in the national interest to restrict access to certain places and information; and, secondly, that the appropriate balance has been achieved between the security assessment role of ASIO and the access suitability decision making role of agencies.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In reaching these conclusions, however, the committee identified a number of areas of concern, namely: the intrusive nature of security checking, and the extent to which this process itself may deter suitable applicants for positions; the extent of security checking, resulting from the number of government positions requiring the occupants to have a national security clearance; the qualifications from a training and experience of agency officers involved in security clearance decisions; aspects of the procedures adopted by the Security Appeals Tribunal; and the lack of a right of review of agency decisions in relation to access.

          The committee makes nine recommendations in relation to these concerns. Among these are recommendations designed to: allow for greater public accountability by agency heads for decisions related to security access; review the privacy-intrusive nature of the present process; and establish a new security division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and permit appeals to the tribunal in relation to access decisions by agency heads.

          The report makes an important contribution to what should be a continuing examination and discussion of the sensitive issues involved in personnel security. This continuing examination must always seek to balance individual human rights with the needs of national security. I thank committee members for their contributions. I also thank the staff, particularly Donald Nairn, Pat Sherman and Miss Gillies; the secretary during the later stages of the inquiry, Mr Peter Gibson; together with Catherine Cornish, Margaret Gibson and Sophia Konti.

          —As a member of the Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, I support the committee's report. Today I wish to speak about chapter 3 of the report which deals with the role of the agencies. The agencies have the final responsibility on security clearances. The committee raised some matters in this regard which were certainly of concern. The committee was particularly concerned about the role of the agencies and the extent of the somewhat intrusive questioning of security clearances. Obviously, ASIO has a role, and I certainly support the report's recommendations on ASIO.

          Over-classification was one of the matters dealt with by the committee. Too many positions are classified as security positions, and that sheets back to the agencies. The recommendations go further than that. On a matter of great concern to the committee, it is worth quoting from Mr Kevin O'Connor, the Privacy Commissioner, who states:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Individuals must provide detailed personal information in a questionnaire and/or interview. These details are then checked against information held by other agencies—including the police and in some cases, ASIO, to confirm the details provided and/or ascertain if there is other relevant information. In some cases, personal information about third persons, such as spouses or other relatives, is collected and checked: this often occurs without the knowledge or involvement of these third parties. In such cases, the issue arises as to whether these third persons should be made aware that information about them is being recorded and given the opportunity to comment; and whether their consent is sought before checks are carried out.
        </para>
        <para>
         The committee was impressed by the strength of the arguments of the Privacy Commissioner. The committee stated in the report:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The involvement of third parties on issues unrelated to work performance is an unwarranted and unnecessary intrusion on personal privacy.
        </para>
        <para>
         To illustrate this, appendix C of the report contains personal particulars forms. Question 13 in the personal particulars form No. 1 is:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Do you have a Spouse/De Facto/Fiance(e)?
        </para>
        <para>
         Question 14 is:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Has this person visited or resided overseas?
        </para>
        <para>
         That question is very broad, and it is questionable as to whether it is relevant to a security report. These forms are certainly intrusive to third parties. The committee has made recommendations—not definite recommendations—on this matter in its report. I think the chairman of the committee would agree with me in saying that this matter is obviously something which the committee would want to monitor in the future.

          The Privacy Commissioner told the committee that he was concerned that very junior officers sometimes carried out questioning using the personal particulars questionnaire. I guess it adds insult to injury when senior officers of the Public Service are questioned by junior officers on quite personal matters, such as whether they have a fiance or whether their fiance has relatives overseas. The committee recommended that all security interviews within agencies be conducted by appropriately qualified, trained and experienced officers. I think that is very important.

         The delegation to the 39th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in Cyprus, and to Malta and Germany in September last year, was significant in a number of ways. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference was attended by 247 delegates from 97 Commonwealth jurisdictions. Its theme was the role of the Commonwealth in world economic development and its impact on the environment; the strengthening of parliamentary democracy; world security; and the safeguarding of human rights. Commonwealth of Australia branch delegates contributed to all plenary and panel sessions.

         The CPA's formal decision making body, the general assembly, was especially significant in that it adopted a new constitution. The former constitution had been in effect since 1977 and had been much amended, leading to problems of interpretation and questions as to its consistency. The Commonwealth of Australia branch, and particularly former President Kerry Sibraa, had put considerable effort into the development of the draft. Our delegation was successful in persuading the general assembly to agree to certain amendments to the proposed constitution. The adoption of the constitution, as amended, was received with utmost satisfaction by all concerned.

         The delegation's visit to Malta was the first official visit by a delegation from the Australian parliament. Australia's relations with Malta at the parliamentary, governmental and citizen levels remain excellent, enhanced somewhat by the large numbers in Australia of Maltese-born citizens and those claiming Maltese ancestry. Discussions were held with the Maltese President, the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the Leader of the Opposition, central political party representatives and leading figures in industry and commerce.

         The visit to Germany was the first by a parliamentary delegation since the 1989 unification. The timing was interesting in that the commencement of the visit coincided with the Hamburg state elections in what was described by one participant in the delegation's program as a marathon period of elections. In Hamburg the Social Democratic Party lost its absolute majority but retained power with the support of the Greens. The Christian Democratic Union vote fell to 25 per cent and a right wing extremist candidate failed to be elected by only 0.2 per cent. Some observers saw the result as a protest vote against the major parties and a major shift in politics resulting from changes in eastern Europe, and as an indication of Germany in microcosm.

         Yet again that conference demonstrated what a diverse group of nations the British Commonwealth of Nations has become. It is no longer, if it ever was, just a group of traditional English-speaking, prosperous, white democracies. The majority of delegates these days come from countries that are black, Indian, Third World or African. Surprisingly, a number of French speaking parliaments are also represented at the conference. It was an excellent meeting which certainly did a great deal to further extend the bonds of goodwill that exist between Commonwealth countries.

         I suppose not many world shattering resolutions are ever carried or dealt with at these types of gatherings but I thought the final communique was a bit of a disappointment. I think it showed very little reflection of what actually happened at the conference.

         We had the opportunity to see something of Cyprus but, even without our own visual observations, the so-called Cyprus problem, as it is euphemistically described, was ever present in the debates. The division of Cyprus into Greek and Turkish sectors is a tragedy which falls very heavily on the lives of the local people. The Australian police force that is currently fulfilling a role there is very highly thought of. From time to time there have been suggestions that Australia should withdraw that group of men and women. I can assure the parliament that such an action would not be well received by the people of Cyprus. Their role is appreciated and there is a desire to maintain that United Nations presence to ensure peace and security between the Greek and Turkish sectors.

         The visit to Malta was also a wonderful experience. As was previously mentioned, it is perhaps surprising that this was the first visit ever by an Australian parliamentary delegation to Malta. There are lots of ties between our two countries. Virtually every Maltese family can tell stories of their relatives in Australia. We were told on more than one occasion that there were more Maltese in Australia than in Malta. Some of those people who came here years ago are now returning to their home country as the Maltese economy improves and it is now a little more difficult to obtain work in Australia.

         There are close ties between Australia and Malta. We were warmly welcomed in Malta and had the opportunity to meet all of the leading political and business figures of that country. There is a strong desire in Malta to strengthen links with Australia. In particular, the Maltese regularly raise their desire to have air links between Malta and Australia to facilitate a more appropriate method of travel. The country has a magnificent history. It has been a fortress for something like 2,000 years, strategically located no matter what conflict there seems to have been in the world, and its heroic people have certainly filled a very prominent role in the history of the world.

         The journey to Germany enabled us to learn something about the enormous impact of reuniting East and West Germany. The East Germans, who have lived in a sheltered economy for a long time, are now exposed to the rigours of international competition. It is not just ordinary international competition, because it is now in direct association with West Germany, one of the most vigorous economies in the world.

         The East Germans are not finding that experience to be all plain sailing. There are many difficulties, but they are adjusting and there is a great deal of confidence that the new Germany will be stronger as a result. I think it was a very useful exchange. I would join my colleagues in thanking the leader of the delegation, Senator Kerry Sibraa, as well as Ian Harris, Fred Peppinck and others associated with assisting the delegation. We learnt a great deal and I am sure that our understanding of the issues of the world has been greatly strengthened as a result of the delegation.

          —by leave—The report that I have just presented is the third review of an audit report that I have tabled this year. On a previous occasion I emphasised how important it was for the parliament to take careful note of audit reports and for it to call on government departments to explain how they are going to overcome any deficiencies identified by the auditors. In this case I am very pleased to report that the agency concerned, the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, CEPA, has taken a positive, indeed pro-active, approach to the audit report.

          Undertaken during 1992 by the Australian National Audit Office, the efficiency audit was intended to determine how the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commonwealth's environmental impact assessment processes could be improved. CEPA is to be commended for its initiative in developing a detailed strategic approach to implement the auditors' recommendations. However, the committee is concerned that CEPA's effort has not been matched by other departments and agencies with responsibilities under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974.

          In the 20 years since the act was introduced, Australia has undergone some dramatic changes. The emphasis on conservation, preservation and protection of the environment has taken on new dimensions. Environmental impact assessment has become a routine part of decision making but, as the audit revealed and as CEPA's subsequent actions confirmed, there is considerable scope for reform of the administration of the environmental impact assessment process.

          One of the features of the act—and it can be argued that it is a deficiency—is that departments and agencies other than CEPA have to make the initial assessment about whether a proposed action is likely to give rise to significant environmental impact. The main environmental impact assessment provisions of the act are triggered only if this initial assessment identifies potential impacts. This procedure means that the so-called action agencies that make this initial assessment need staff who are knowledgeable in the EIA process.

          One of the most important findings emerging from the committee's review of the audit is the pressing need for information and training in the EIA process. At present there is a notable lack of expertise among officers in other agencies which are involved in environmental impact assessment. CEPA has developed a comprehensive draft operational manual which should be of considerable assistance to other agencies in writing their own in-house manuals and organising their own staff development programs. CEPA will take a leadership role in developing appropriate education strategies to increase the level of expertise of all environmental impact assessment practitioners, but the committee firmly believes that this task must be a shared one. The development of greater expertise within action agencies is likely to encourage the integration of environmental decisions with general administrative processes.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          To assist further in the education process, CEPA is proposing to set up an environmental impact assessment practitioners' network that is designed to bring together a cross-section of people who are participants in the EIA process and other interested parties, such as industry representatives, academics and conservation organisations. The purpose of the network will be to facilitate the sharing, evaluation and dissemination of information and to promote stronger relations between all parties. The committee has recommended that all departments and agencies with responsibilities under the act support the proposed network and demonstrate their support by allocating adequate resources to ensure its success.

          Another deficiency in the act is the lack of provision for the monitoring of compliance with conditions imposed on developments and for assessing the actual impacts of projects once they become operational. CEPA commissioned a consultancy to evaluate and report on the best options for monitoring approved projects. This is another area where the response of other agencies will be important.

          The committee believes that memoranda of understanding between the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and all government agencies that make environmentally significant decisions have been much underrated and underutilised. They serve a valuable purpose in assisting agencies in the important task of evaluating the environmental significance of proposals. They do this by establishing appropriate procedures for determining environmental significance, by providing guidance as to which proposals should be referred for consideration and by ensuring that other agencies are aware of proposals. The committee believes that it is important for the parliament to be aware of progress in the negotiation of memoranda of understanding.

          The audit report recommended the introduction of a consulting fee as a means to force action agencies to improve their capacity to make decisions about the environmental significance of proposals. However, the committee believes it is important that open communication channels exist and advice and support be freely available throughout the process as decisions made by other agencies may have significant environmental implications. The committee proposes to continue to consult with CEPA and to monitor the performance of the agencies that need to participate in the implementation of the audit findings to ensure that the opportunities for reform created by the audit are not wasted.

          Whilst the EIA process has some shortcomings and unnecessary complexities and loopholes, it is a valuable tool in the protection of the environment. The recent mushroom growth of mobile phone towers is a cause of dismay to many not only because of the visual ugliness and inappropriateness of many of the locations but also principally because of the lack of consultation or forewarning. The builders of these eyesores, which are the three carriers—Optus, Telecom and Vodaphone—are all but exempt from environmental impact considerations and can continue to build towers anywhere they like. The normal application of environmental impact assessment procedures would have forced these operators to consider alternatives such as the co-location of facilities and would have required public consultation.

          —by leave—This is the third in a recent series of reports by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts into audit reports on a number of Commonwealth programs. This report is the least controversial of them all. While there is some criticism of the way in which some programs have been operated, generally there is agreement that the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency is trying hard and is serious about implementing its responsibilities. However, there is some question about whether other departments and sectors of government adequately recognise their obligations in this area and have responded appropriately to the legislation.

          The Environment Protection (Impact Of Proposals) Act was passed by the parliament in 1974. Under this act, Commonwealth projects likely to affect the environment are subject to examination on their potential environmental impact. The review is not merely to be associated with proposed capital works or projects of that nature; it can also deal with proposals, negotiations and agreements, including agreements with the various states and territories, decisions and recommendations that are made by various government agencies or other proposals involving the incurring of expenditure.

          The Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency is responsible for administering the various aspects of this act. It has sought to guarantee these processes through the establishment of a number of formal memoranda of understanding. There have been negotiations with various agencies as to the way in which environmental impact assessments will occur whenever proposals are initiated. Even at this stage—20 years after the implementation of the act—only 22 of these memoranda are in existence. Some of them are with agencies that have subsequently ceased to exist. I refer briefly to page 10 of the report. It states:

         The Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation commented on the delays in negotiating MOUs in 1979 and 1985. On the second occasion, the committee reported that it was `appalled' that only two MOUs had been agreed in the six years since the 1979 report, bringing the total to eight. Some progress has been made in negotiating MOUs since 1985, but it appears that departments and agencies are still reluctant to finalise negotiations, despite the potential to clarify administrative complexities and streamline the EIA processes.

         The progress in this area has, to say the least, certainly been slow. Questions need to be asked as to what level of commitment there is in many government departments and agencies towards the environmental impact assessment process. It has to be regarded as a pretty half-hearted response that in 20 years so few agencies seem to have put in place appropriate mechanisms to ensure that their proposals and projects do not have adverse environmental impacts.

          The audit report makes 19 recommendations, 17 of which have been agreed to by CEPA and one with qualified agreement. The qualified agreement is in a matter dealing with fees. In this area, ironically the committee came to the conclusion that it disagreed with the Auditor-General's recommendation. It suggested that fees should not be charged by CEPA. Clearly, if there is some reluctance for agencies to be involved in this process, they will be more reluctant if they have to pay fees for the process.

          I conclude by saying that, if there is to be a fee schedule, government agencies and departments will clearly be less likely to seek the advice and assistance of CEPA than if the advice is handed out freely and on request. There needs to be a general encouragement of government agencies and departments to ensure that they fulfil their responsibilities under this process. CEPA needs to be given support in its endeavours to ensure that its responsibilities under the act are fulfilled.

        Single voyage permits are nothing more than an attempt to weaken cabotage in this country. In most of the world cabotage is closely protected, but the issue of single voyage permits is a way around this. It is the way those opposite would go as they would open our coast to the dangerous rust buckets of the world. It is because of the threat of cabotage and the dangers to our marine environment that I strongly oppose the issue of single voyage permits. The issue of single voyage permits should only be sanctioned in extreme cases, not as now, by the minister's own admission, where the issue is a mere formality.

        Continuing with the issuing of single voyage permits and allowing the foreign rust buckets to carry our cargo around the ports of Australia will make it even more easy to sell off the Australian National Line, which is something some, even on my side of politics unfortunately, would condone. To sell ANL would be extreme economic folly.

        The world's shipping fleet is ageing. Even if we commence replacement building today, within 10 years there will be a shortage of ships and, perhaps even more serious, there will be a shortage of trained personnel to crew these ships. But what is a clever country's response to this challenge? By issuing single voyage permits we are increasingly allowing foreign flag vessels to carry cargo around Australia, thus denying those opportunities and revenue to our own line.

        The dramatic increase in the numbers of single voyage permits issued over the last few years is, I would suggest, no cause for celebration. The rules in existence concerning the issue of these permits must be enforced. Let us hope that in a few years there is a decline in the numbers of single voyage permits issued and that this cargo is being carried where it rightly belongs: in Australian flagged and crewed ships. Then the minister, I hope, will be as gleeful as he was at that meeting in Melbourne in April of this year.

I agree with him when he said that single voyage permits are available only when there is no Australian ship to do the job. I agree with him on that. But then we heard him attacking the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). Is this the sign of a major split in the government? Are we finally seeing the Left and the Right about to come to blows over the single voyage permit policy?

        The honourable member was not happy with just attacking his minister. He then went on to attack the government department. He said that it was not administering the policy that the minister has announced and has been supported by the government for some years now. So he found that the administration is no good. Maybe he ought to go into the caucus room when ministers meet tomorrow and give them a good lecture. Some of them might be quite interested in what he has to say. Then we had highly emotional talk about what might happen to the Great Barrier Reef. Like all honourable members, I would do anything reasonable and possible to stop pollution on the Great Barrier Reef. It has not happened. The honourable member then cited the example of a grain ship having major defects as though this is proof that an oil tanker is suddenly going to go around to the Great Barrier Reef and do the unthinkable.

        We then heard some highly emotional and quite fantastic examples of what may or may not happen if a rust bucket were to go down. But, as the honourable member knows only too well, Australia is well noted in world shipping circles for enforcing considerably higher standards than some other countries do. When he makes comments such as `No doubt, the majority of ships do not comply with Australian standards', we have to question what he is saying about most ships that come into Australian ports. He knows only too well that not only are they well run; they are also well maintained and well serviced. He can always provide some exceptions, but he knows full well that Australia does insist on much higher standards. To suggest that the removal of cabotage creates an `open run for rust buckets', as he puts it, is just utter rubbish. If he wants to make a decent case, he ought to have much sounder facts to back up his argument.

He attacked the government because it was supposedly going to sell the ANL and then he said that it should not be sold. I ask the honourable member: what is going on? Is he not a member of the government? He has attacked it on the single voyage permits; he has accused it of not enforcing the law as it has been passed through this parliament; he attacked his minister; and then he attacked the Australian Labor Party on its proposal to sell the Australian National Line.

It is just marvellous. How long has the Labor Party been in government? The honourable member said that it is the opposition's fault. Then, just to make sure that we did not get diverted too much, he started to talk about the Australian flags on the desks of opposition members. He ought to be very proud of the Australian flag, as are most Australians. If he were to look at the polls, he would see that the majority of Australians happen to be rather proud of the Australian flag. So, if I were him, I would not spend too much time attacking the flag.

        I want to refer to the main point raised by the honourable member: single voyage permits. I said at the beginning of my speech that single voyage permits are available only if an Australian ship is not there to do the job or if an Australian ship is not adequate to meet the needs of the port or ports that would be used. One other occasion when single voyage permits would be available is if the minister is satisfied that it is desirable and in the public interest that unlicensed ships be allowed to engage in that trade.

        Obviously, the minister is unlikely to do that, but there are occasions when he might, for example, if the owner or the agent of a ship were to offer to carry cargo freight free on behalf of a recognised amateur sporting group or a charity. The minister would then obviously have to be satisfied that it met this criterion. Another example is if some cargo handling equipment were being relocated from one stevedoring facility to another. It is true, as the honourable member has pointed out, that the number of single voyage permits has increased. In fact, it has risen from 72 in 1982-83 to 307 in 1992-93. That increase over that 10-year period has been under a Labor administration. There is clearly an indicated need, otherwise this would not have been occurring.

        —I thank the House. We ought to be looking at some of the costs involved in shipping in Australia to see where Australia is lagging behind. If we look at this survey, if we take as a base rate the port of Melbourne as 100 per cent, we find that Sydney's costs are 79 per cent; Fremantle, 76 per cent; Adelaide, 56 per cent; and Brisbane, 50 per cent. But, if we compare the costs with those of a couple of ports in New Zealand, we find that Auckland's costs are only 35 per cent—about one-third of the cost of the port of Melbourne—and that Wellington's costs are 25 per cent.

        I suggest to the honourable member that he ought to be attacking his government and his minister about tackling some of these. We do not have to just look across the Tasman; we could also look at the costs in Europe. Hamburg is more expensive but Rotterdam is considerably cheaper than Melbourne, and Tilbury is cheaper than that. If we go to other ports in Europe, we find that Fos-Sur-Mer's port costs are 54 per cent of those of Melbourne; Zeebrugge, 44 per cent; Barcelona, 31 per cent; and Lisbon, 26 per cent.

        I also refer the honourable member to a report published by the Business Council of Australia just over a month ago, which makes some comparisons of other costs. It found that, for example, the manning costs for Australian dry bulk vessels were over 40 per cent greater than those of the lowest comparable country using a national crew, which—before the honourable member jumps in—happened to be a UK crew. As pointed out in this report, Australian crews incurred higher indirect manning costs—that includes leave provisions and on-costs, such as training and recruiting—than coastal crews from any of the other selected overseas countries. It also pointed out another matter which the honourable member ought to be taking very seriously: the costs of fuel for Australia were the highest of the selected countries. Why? It is mainly because the high excise tax significantly inflates the purchase price of fuel.

        The honourable member ought to be looking at all those costs very seriously before he comes in with his emotional case about single voyage permits. If he is serious about trying to make the Australian National Line and other Australian shipping companies competitive with the rest of the world, then he ought to look at some of these costs, many of which are under the control of this government. I think that, far from being concerned about single voyage permits, he should direct himself to these other issues, which are considerably more significant in terms of making the cost of exporting out of this country more expensive than it need otherwise be and, hence, not only increasing the cost of our exports, but also getting a decent figure for our balance of payments just that much harder.

        In proposing this motion, I ask a simple question of the government: who is more fiscally responsible and better able to spend the hard earned money of Australian taxpayers and manage government services—the states or Canberra? I have always been of the view that the trend to the centralisation of power in Canberra is anathema to the ideal of giving Australians better and more efficient government services.

        If we look closely at the government's 1994-95 budget papers, the Working Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and historic trends, we immediately see a worrying trend emerging in this country. It is a trend that sees the Commonwealth government hell-bent on strangling the states' ability to fund services at the grassroots level and thereby vesting more control over expenditure in Canberra. It is obvious that the government is determined to hitch a piggyback ride on the long suffering states with regard to fiscal responsibility while becoming ever more burdensome itself through its orgy of spending.

        The Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Willis), as well as their predecessors, have often stated that micro-economic reform is primarily the responsibility of the states. Why will the Prime Minister not let the states get on with it? The problem with micro-economic reform for the Labor Party is that it is sandbagged by an ideology which inevitably ends up in increased spending when factional infighting causes the government to attempt to placate as many minorities and factional subgroupings as possible. I had to smile a little when I read the comments of the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns). He talked about the way minority groups have been accommodated by the federal government in recent years. We need to consider how easily the government backs down to minority groups when it is put under pressure.

        When we look at the budget forward estimates, two things become clear. The Keating government has committed itself to a huge spending increase which will result in an effective deficit of $17 billion in 1994-95 after allowance is made for major asset sales and provision for GBE superannuation. The second aspect that comes to light is that the government is substantially using the improving fiscal performance of the states to fund this spending spree. What message is the government sending to the people of this country? It appears to be quite clear.

The government is saying that more spending is needed and we need not worry about the low level of domestic savings—the level of household savings is predicted to fall even further during 1994-95—or the rapidly rising level and cost of public debt. As we all know, it is a national scandal that the Commonwealth debt is forecast to rise by 15 per cent to $95 billion during the next financial year.

        This message of big spending at any cost runs counter to the message that the states are rightly trying to give to their constituents. On the one hand, we have states pushing the doctrine of careful and responsible financial management; on the other we have a federal government throwing money around like confetti. What are the people of Australia to make out of this? The federal government should be leading the way in fiscal reform. Instead this government is abrogating any responsibility it has for fiscal leadership. To rub salt into the wounds, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are relying on states' revenue to fund the massively increasing levels of expenditure to which I have just referred.

        The states have largely done their part in turning Australia around economically. The budget papers forward estimates minus asset sales show likely surpluses in Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria. This is due mainly to the effects of increasing stamp duty and other fixed charges rising on the back of improving economies in these states. Not content to sponge off the added revenue generated by the states, the federal government has employed even more sinister ways of bringing the states to heel regarding fiscal policy. I refer to the government's continued campaign to force state governments to spend existing Commonwealth grants in areas targeted by the federal government. It has resulted in the level of untied grants to the states from Canberra decreasing and the level of tied or specific purpose grants increasing as a percentage of all grants. This is further evidence of the trend by Labor to neuter the states and vest further control in Canberra.

        For example, historically, in the decade before Labor came to government, tied grants made up just over 32 per cent of all grants. A decade after Labor was elected, tied grants now form 43 per cent of all grants. This quite clearly hits at the very centre of the relationship between the states and the federal government. This trend must be reversed through the sensible allocation of more control to the states where the funds are administered more closely to the community which they affect.

        I remind those opposite with short memories that the 1990 Special Premiers Conference stated its objective to return levels of tied grants to 1980s levels. The Prime Minister has not only ignored this, but also embarked on a further course of emasculating the states. The average Australian may well have difficulty in distinguishing between tied and untied grants, but the fact remains that the federal government is increasingly using the twin levers of tied grants and reduced funding to squeeze those states that it sees as the enemy. By this, I mean the Liberal state governments that have taken on the task of righting the dreadful financial mess-ups of their predecessor Labor administrations, and they are succeeding spectacularly.

We even have a failed Labor premier from Western Australia now holding a very senior portfolio in the federal government. I must say that if the history of her government is any guide, then we are in for a woeful time in relation to health policy. As if the government is not satisfied with ripping control off the states and entrenching centralism in Canberra, it has embarked on a concerted campaign in recent years to hand over control to committees of the United Nations and to Geneva through the ILO.

This is all the more worrying when one considers that the states' funds are targeted at real community services such as health, education and law and order. The moneys generated by the states and leached off by the federal government are in many respects expended on intangibles with dubious and often straight out non-existent benefits for the taxpayers who provided the funds in the first place.

        —I rise to oppose the motion moved by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). The motion itself and his contribution are essentially based on faulty facts, faulty analysis and faulty logic. The first paragraph of the honourable member's formal motion refers to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) having argued that much of micro-economic reform is the responsibility of the states. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and this government, say that micro-economic reform is a responsibility of all governments in Australia—local, state and federal.

        The Commonwealth has been the leader in micro-economic reform in this country over the last 10 years. A good example of that—one the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, is closely aware of and involved in—is the recent decision of the meeting of Commonwealth and state heads of government in respect of competition policy and the Hilmer report. Once again, with this micro-economic reform, the states were dragged to the table by the Commonwealth. We say there is a responsibility at all levels of government but we also say that the federal government has been the key mover of micro-economic reform in this country over the last decade. Paragraph (b) of the motion of the honourable member for Moore states:

       This assumes that micro-economic reform is linked to more revenue. That is not necessarily the case. For example, one of the key micro-economic reforms that the government is supporting under its access to justice plan is reform of the legal profession. We do not need a greater handout to any of the states to ensure that we have competition in and reform of the legal profession in the states. This notion that the states must somehow get a greater share of revenue to effect micro-economic reform is based on faulty logic and faulty analysis.

        In paragraph (d) of the motion, the honourable member for Moore refers to Commonwealth revenue. Let us look at some of the facts and analysis. In the 1994-95 Budget Paper No. 1, table No. 1 at page 1.8 refers to Commonwealth budget outlays and revenue as a percentage of GDP. Let us find out who the big spenders and the big taxers are. In the last period of coalition government, outlays by the Commonwealth totalled 27.6 per cent of GDP in 1976-77 and, in the coalition's last year, 1982-83, they totalled 28.8 per cent. Commonwealth outlays totalled 25.2 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 and the projection for 1997-98 is 24.2 per cent. In terms of outlays, those opposite are the big spenders. Again in the last years of coalition government, in 1981-82 Commonwealth revenues totalled 25.9 per cent of GDP and, in 1982-83, 26.1 per cent. In 1990-91 revenue was 25.7 per cent of GDP, projected to fall in 1997-98 to 23.8 per cent. So we know who the big taxers and the big spenders are. It is the coalition.

         Commonwealth financial relations with other levels of government
        </emphasis>
        , which details the precise nature of Commonwealth-state relations and finances. The 1993-94 Budget Paper No. 3, at pages 20 and 21, gives a very good summary of the precise state of Commonwealth-state financial relations. At page 21 it says:

       The Commonwealth's macroeconomic responsibilities necessarily require a focus on the overall financial position of the total public sector. Changes in the level of Commonwealth payments to the State/local sector are an important means by which the Commonwealth can seek to influence the stance of fiscal policy.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The States' response to Commonwealth policies is also very important in determining the overall economic impact of public sector activity. Hence, the stance of Commonwealth fiscal policy and, in particular, the level of payments to other tiers of government must reflect judgments as to the relevant capacity of each level of government to accommodate the policy adjustments that may be considered necessary. Charts 9 and 10 help to illustrate this by comparing real annual growth in Commonwealth and State total revenue with annual growth in State own-source revenue and net Commonwealth payments to the States.

       The 1994 Premiers Conference decided to improve that position and place it on a per capita basis. The key point here—it is in the charts that I have referred to—is that all state and local sector sources of funding over the period 1961-62 to 1991-92 show a consistent trend line. State-own source revenue shows a consistent trend upwards. The mix is that when we find an increase in state-own source revenue we find a comparable reduction in net Commonwealth payments. But the key point is that there is a consistent trend line over a 30-year period for all governments, with state sources of funding on that consistent trend line. The argument that is put about the reduction of Commonwealth funds to the states is precisely balanced by the increase in the states' own revenue sources.

        The 1994-95 Budget Paper No. 3, at page 4, contains a very good summary of the decision made at the Premiers Conference in March 1994. The centrepiece of the agreement is the decision that financial assistance grants to the states be maintained in real per capita terms over the next three years—that is, FAGS will be adjusted each year not only for inflation, as has been recent practice, but also for total population growth. The level of general purpose payments to the states will be significantly higher than they would have received over the three years to 1996-97 if the real terms guarantee that applied from 1991-92 to 1993-94 had been extended.

        By 1996-97, on that formula, there is effectively a $450 million increase to the states. Some of the states, including Western Australia, have argued that the mix of Commonwealth-state finances ought to be calculated on the basis of a guaranteed share of revenue. If that had been the case, over the 1980s the states would have received about $2.3 billion less than they actually received under the previous and the current arrangements. That is because Commonwealth tax revenues are more volatile than state revenues. Had there been revenue sharing based on the 1990-91 proportions, the states would have received $2.3 billion less in financial assistance grants from the Commonwealth over the 1991-92 to 1993-94 period than they actually received under the real terms guarantee that was in place.

        —If the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) were to go back and take a look at the early history of his state and compare the revenue and expenditure of the states and the Commonwealth over that period, I think he would see a quite significant and alarming difference. This motion arose from the sheer hypocrisy of the federal government, which sees fit to preach the need for fiscal reform to state governments while clearly failing to reflect that advice in its own economic policy making. The fact is that the 1994-95 Commonwealth budget fails to deliver a fair share of revenue to the states, in that the forward estimate of the budget indicates that the Commonwealth revenue is expected to grow by 34.4 per cent in the period 1993-94 to 1997-98. However, the total grant to the states is expected to grow by only 8.4 per cent over the same period.

        In 1901 the colonies of Australia joined a federation. Our founding fathers wisely recognised the need for a national government to determine national priorities, and none of us argue with that. At the same time, though, it was accepted that state governments were clearly better left to decide and manage the local issues and priorities of their people.

        The federal system was set up to serve in an efficient manner the interests of Australian citizens—and not for cheap political gain. The government hypocrisy has its genesis in its clandestine plan to truly paint itself as big brother and to disperse its ever-increasing revenue base at the expense of the states.

        To illustrate the trend towards centralisation, particularly of financial power, the following figures are graphic. In 1901-02, when the federation first began, the share of revenue to the Commonwealth amounted to 58 per cent. In the corresponding period, the share to the states was 42 per cent. By contrast, the 1993-94 share of revenue to the Commonwealth was 75 per cent and the share to the states was 25 per cent.

        What is more relevant and alarming is the share of expenditure figures, with the Commonwealth collecting revenue far in excess of its expenditure needs. Only a part of the surplus is returned to the states. When the state expenditure exceeds its revenue, the problem of vertical fiscal imbalance arises. This was recognised as a significant problem by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the state premiers in 1990 when they called a special conference to discuss these problems. This move to redress the problem was scrapped by the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is a problem also recognised as significant by an eminent Australian economist, Emeritus Professor Russell Mathews. In May he lectured on federal financial relations at the Australian National University and called for an end to the Commonwealth's virtual tax monopoly.

That decision making should be kept close to the people is well illustrated by the frustrations of people in our territories.

Macro-economic policies have given us an economy that is very much a part of the Asian region. We have a GNP about the same as that of the six ASEAN nations combined, and we are one of the few industrialised economies to have a trade surplus with not just Japan but the whole of Asia. This is not due solely, as one might expect it to be, to our traditional exports of agricultural and mining products. In fact, we are now the 10th largest supplier of manufactured goods to Japan—ahead of Canada, Hong Kong and each of the ASEAN countries.

        Australia is able to compete on an international basis in the manufacturing sector. Exports as a proportion of GDP have grown by about 50 per cent in the past 10 years and stood at 20 per cent of GDP in 1992-93. Australia has also seen exciting growth in the area of elaborately transformed manufactures, with exports in this category almost trebling over the last seven years. Australia has been able to achieve this rapid growth in ETMs by specialising in not only expanding industries, such as pharmaceuticals, medical and scientific equipment and computer hardware, but also certain industries previously thought to be in decline, such as shipbuilding and motor vehicles.

        Given this enviable macro-economic record, where are we to turn our attention to next? Clearly, the answer to that question has to be the area of micro-economic reform and competition policy. Competition policy is an essential element of our future national economic development. We cannot ignore the international nature of our economy, given the GATT round and the increasing international demands for fair and open competition and the removal of hidden subsidies and other barriers to trade. Future benefits in this area will rely on cooperative arrangements between the states and the Commonwealth. That has to be true, given our constitutional framework.

        The Council of Australian Governments agreed in 1992 to the establishment of an inquiry to lay the groundwork for a national competition strategy. In October of that year the Prime Minister established the Hilmer review, based on criteria agreed by the heads of government. The report of the review to COAG in August 1993 represents one of the most significant developments in this field since the enactment of the trade practices legislation in the 1970s. The trade practices area has come out well from that review and, indeed, the review has identified the benefits which have flowed from trade practices reform in the general business community. However, a lot of work now needs to be done in the area of government business enterprises.

        Commonwealth government business enterprises have been subject to Trade Practices Act review since 1977, but that is not the case with respect to state government instrumentalities and state government business enterprises. Indeed, one of the prominent ways in which enterprises can avoid the rigorous impact of trade protection policy and the implementation of free and open competition policy is through the exemptions provided by the state governments and the shield of the Crown which the state governments enjoy.

        A truly effective and national competition policy requires that all service providers in both public and private ownership compete on the same terms. Competition and the distribution of infrastructure in the form of electricity, water, railways, aviation and increasingly telecommunications and other high technology services are vital if we are to reduce costs and improve service in the longer term.

        Already in the last few years we have seen benefits flow from deregulation of domestic aviation in 1990. This has resulted in declining air fares on nearly all routes, saving approximately $100 million a year for consumers of those services. We have also seen the introduction of competition into the telecommunications area, with STD peak rates on the Melbourne-Sydney route falling by 21 per cent between June 1992, when Optus first entered the market, and May 1993.

        While the Commonwealth and states have agreed in principle to the Hilmer reforms, the hard part of that process is yet to begin. The states will find themselves with an internal conflict of interest in that their immediate financial incentive will be to sell some of their business units for as high a price as they can get when Hilmer will reduce the effective value of some of these assets by exposing them to competition. It is essential that we overcome this internal reticence on the part of the states and ensure that those enterprises, where possible, be exposed to the full effects and benefits of competitive processes.

        It does not necessarily follow from those Hilmer processes, though, that those enterprises need necessarily reduce in value. Some of the examples we have seen in the area of electricity are very instructive in this case. It is quite possible that, through reductions in cost structures and improvements in productivity which will flow from the benefits of that competitive policy, we will see the value of those enterprises enhanced and increasing revenue flowing to the states from them. Therefore, it should not be immediately supposed that an open competition regime, which Hilmer proposes, will necessarily adversely impact on state budgets. It is very much a question of how this is approached and how the states go about unbundling some of those enterprises to ensure that, where necessary, the network and generating facilities are retained in the hands of the state business enterprise while perhaps enabling some of the distribution mechanisms to be open to franchise agreements and further competition.

        In the telecommunications industry, which is very much a growing and evolving industry, I think we have already seen some of the ways in which this process can occur. Austel, for example, has been established to separate regulation from the delivery of service by Telecom. Telecom, of course, has previously had an important regulatory role which has now been overtaken by an independent regulator, Austel, and of course Telecom has now been left to deliver the service rather than regulate its provision. As Telecom is the provider of the national telecommunications infrastructure, it is essential that that infrastructure be made available to any other operator. Currently it is restricted to Optus but eventually, of course, it will be open on a much wider basis.

        We have already seen substantial benefits flow from allowing other parties to access the nationally owned infrastructure but on terms which are regulated by the independent regulatory authority—Austel in this case. Other people are able to gain access to Telecom's networks at what amount to wholesale rates and then compete in the delivery of those services in a very effective manner. We certainly should not permit the duplication of very expensive infrastructure, such as the telecommunications network, when in fact we can gain the benefits of competition by simply determining access policies to those broader networks at reasonable prices and then ensuring appropriate franchise agreements to provide for the community service obligations which those existing government enterprises provide. Indeed, in the telecommunications industry we have seen the way in which Optus has been required to provide a levy to ensure that the community service obligations of Telecom are fairly funded across the board by all those who are part of the process. The importance of the social justice criteria which for many decades in this country have been underlying government enterprise in this area cannot be neglected in any element of competition policy.

        It is also quite critical that we turn our attention to other areas of competition and, indeed, to some classic cases of market failure. In that regard I would look no further than the health industry and the legal industry. We have seen doctors and lawyers enjoy some very restrictive practices which have not been exposed to the benefits of competition and have resulted in what amounts to a classic failure of marketplace economics. Where anti-competitive arrangements exist within a profession and are not authorised in the public interest—which should be the sole criterion in this context—it is essential that that profession be required to be exposed to competition. It is very easy to suspect that, because certain professions are operating in the private sector, they are automatically competing on an open and fair basis, but that is not necessarily the case, as we have already seen with the legal profession and the restrictions which are imposed on that.

The  opposition endorses the  need  for  a coordinated national agenda on micro-economic reform, for which this motion seeks support. The coalition has welcomed Hilmer's report, although it has expressed some strong reservations. The general benefits of Hilmer's suggested reforms can be significant, especially when coupled with those recommendations to reform the professions in the private sector, as the member's motion highlights. However, I would like to express a number of major reservations.

        If there is a major push on regulatory reform and full-scale nationwide competition, it must not come at the expense of the delivery of vital services and facilities, particularly to rural areas, such as the one which I represent. The Hilmer recommendations have not been embraced by rural areas as enthusiastically as they have today by the honourable member for Bonython. The general reaction to Hilmer in rural regions is the recognition that something has to be shut or closed—be it a post office, a bank or the abolition of a statutory marketing authority.

        Over the last decade rural areas have been asked to bear the brunt of considerable reform. Trade barriers have been lowered and almost abolished in some areas, exposing fragile industries to the international market. The user-pays ideology dominates. Whilst the many government reforms in air and transport—which the honourable member brought to our attention—and in telecommunications have had immediate advantages for predominantly urban dwellers, rural people are still waiting for the benefits. They have suffered a substantial erosion of services, particularly in the areas of post, telecommunications and banking. There have been wide scale social implications with enforced economic rationalisation in government service providers. The Hilmer review can be criticised on the ground that it fails to take these social implications fully into account. This worries me. Leaving the market as the mechanism to resolve community concerns will place my rural constituents further out on a limb in the absence of critical population mass. Reliance on outcome certainties in rural areas would be better than market-driven approaches. The honourable member mentioned the community service obligations of government business enterprises. Under Hilmer, there is no doubt that these will be exposed to diminution. Unless the community service obligations of government statutory utilities are reinforced prior to any implementation of Hilmer's recommendations, rural people will suffer. Government needs to decide whether it wants people to live in rural Australia or whether it is intent on making it too expensive.

        Australians living and working in rural and isolated areas are entitled to be provided with telephone and postal services of the same quality and standard, embracing new technological advances, as those available to people living in urban areas. Were telephone services to be deregulated as envisaged by Hilmer, no single carrier could be identified as responsible for universal service obligations. An example of what can happen is what is already happening in the delivery of mobile telephone services, particularly in my electorate.

        The Mallee electorate covers roughly a quarter of the state of Victoria, yet only 15 per cent of that area is currently serviced by mobile telephones. If we are going to encourage new enterprises to go out there, we need to provide them with the technological advances which will allow them to compete in an international environment. When I complain about this situation, a typical response contained in one of the many letters I receive from Telecom is:

        It might interest you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to note that the entire municipality of the shire of Wimmera—a significant shire in my electorate—now no longer has a single post office as a result of the rationalisation that has occurred to Australia Post. This is despite recent assurances by the minister in this House that post offices would not be closed, and despite assurances that there would be no adverse impacts as a result of the government's decision to lower the competitive price threshold from $4.50 to $1.80. Again I would say that the government needs to decide whether it wants people to live in rural areas and whether it wants to provide those areas with modern services. The minister should give consideration to advancing the rural mail services review which is due to report in 1996. I would like to see the results of that review at least a year earlier so that the real impacts on rural areas can be realised.

        I also have major concerns in relation to what Professor Hilmer says about statutory marketing authorities. Professor Hilmer states quite categorically that statutory marketing arrangements are grossly inefficient and, effectively, tax users and consumers. This statement I would wholeheartedly contest because it fails to recognise that the major marketing authorities operating in extremely aggressive international export markets do so at great benefit to all Australians by enhancing export income. They are not price fixing mechanisms, they are price negotiating mechanisms, which is responsible, orderly marketing. If what Professor Hilmer says is fully implemented, Australians generally stand to be substantially disadvantaged. One of the major criticisms of Hilmer's report is that it has a very strong domestic focus; it fails to recognise the international focus of many of our commodities as they are delivered.

What we are seeing currently is frightening small business right across the nation. These industries need policy which reduces the burden of taxation. All of these things add costs and charges to business and industry and reduce their ability to compete, particularly in an international environment.

        As well as that, cuts in undue government spending to fund the huge bureaucracies of government need to be given serious attention.

If all these can be included in a national agenda then we truly will have genuine macro-economic reform.

        It is true to say that we have benefited in the areas where we have deregulated monopolies and provided competition. The greater area of concern is whether or not we have given sufficient recognition to the fact that all consumers may not have equal access or equal power. As the member for Mallee pointed out, some consumers do not have a choice about products at all. I would like to advance the proposition that in pushing very hard for competition policy we need to strengthen consumers' rights. It is very difficult to ask farmers or small bush enterprises to be competitive with their sister organisations in regional cities or capital cities if they do not have the same access to infrastructure. I think that is the point the honourable member for Mallee is concerned about, and I strongly support that view.

        Even in my own electorate, when it comes to communication, whilst there has been so much development of communication and prices and charges have generally lowered, it still remains the case that the poor do not have access to communications. Given that the communications media are going to be the vehicles by which in the future we will deliver the benefits of the super highway by saying to whole sections of Australians, whether they be rural and provincial Australians or whether they be urban, poor Australians, `You're going to miss out,' that will in fact double, treble or whatever the disadvantages that they may currently suffer.

        Together with competition policy, its espousal and its implementation, I also suggest that we should focus on the needs of consumers and consumer rights. For example, we are very keen to see the distribution of electricity and its retail system throughout the state governments, as well as that of the water boards, subject to further competition, and I support that idea. But I would like to remind the House that most of the money provided for emergency funding by the federal government to the states goes to people who have had their electricity or water cut off. That does not mean that competition is bad; that is far from the point that I want to make. But I do think that instrumentalities need to be far more innovative in dealing with the so-called battling consumer. All too readily a slow payer is labelled the same as a defaulting payer, and there is a world of difference. As yet we do not encourage monthly billing. I would like to see it encouraged. There is no doubt in my mind that more frequent, smaller bills would make budgeting for poorer, battling customers so much easier.

Firstly, the specialists regulate their own numbers by limiting the supply of specialists coming on every year.

        Perhaps this reflects a weakness in the current system that needs to be addressed.

As the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) has said, the opposition supports the thrust of the Hilmer report. We believe that competition is a good thing.

         —On 21 February this year I moved a private members motion calling on the federal government to introduce legislation to outlaw female genital mutilation in Australia. There was bipartisan support for the motion and since then the New South Wales government has introduced legislation to amend the Crimes Act 1900 to make it an offence to mutilate external female genitalia or to aid, abet, counsel or procure such mutilation.

         Having written to all state Attorneys-General, I was pleased to find this subject listed for discussion at the next meeting of Attorneys-General. Today I place on the record my appreciation of the report to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) prepared by the Family Law Council. The conclusions and recommendations are sensible and sensitive, acknowledging the need for both education and uniform legislation and the need for counselling, including for those who reject the practice of female genital mutilation.

          More importantly, I want to comment on the statement made recently by former Prime Minister Hawke that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) will be the next Prime Minister. Of all the things that Mr Hawke has said in his political career, that would have to be the one that has the most truth to it. He is a most astute political observer if he believes, as do many people in the community, that the Leader of the Opposition will become the next Prime Minister of Australia. When they consider the gutter language used by the Prime Minister, the Bankstown Bonaparte, about his own country, they will recognise that the Leader of the Opposition will make a far more distinguished, patriotic and believable Prime Minister than the one we have at the moment.

         —In March 1990, as a result of the crash of an RAAF Nomad aircraft near Adelaide, the husband of one of my constituents was unfortunately killed. That event was followed by an exchange with ministers as to the reasons for the crash and the reasons why those aircraft were constrained in their operations. I am informed that later this week a very major report will be released by the Ombudsman which will validate some of the complaints that were being made at that time. I hope, for the sake of those people who are flying the aircraft in both the air force and the army, that that report will get to the bottom of the crash, as well as giving the widow of that unfortunate officer the real reasons why that aircraft crashed.

We are hearing all about the increase in interest rates and what is going to happen because the government could not run its budget properly, but let us look at what the government's mismanagement is really going to do. I draw members' attention to an address by the new President of the NFF, Mr Don McGauchie, in which he pointed out that a one per cent increase in interest rates will cost the farm sector about $170 million. He also went on to say that a one per cent rise in the exchange rate will similarly cost farmers around $160 million.

         Because of the government's mismanagement, financial institutions are being pressured into putting up interest rates, which in itself will have a very big cost factor for farmers. There is also likely to be a double whammy effect because interest rates will increase the value of the Australian dollar against our major trading partners, in particular the United States dollar, which many agricultural deals are written in. The farming community—one of our major export industries—will be hit twice by this government's mismanagement. It will have a very severe impact.

         —Australian motor cycle grand prix legend Michael Doohan deserves congratulations today on two counts—for his Dutch Grand Prix victory yesterday and for his show of patriotism. Doohan won the 21-lap race in just over 41 minutes, 35 seconds ahead of the 1993 world champion, American Kevin Schwantz, who finished in fifth place. The 29-year-old Queenslander now faces the challenge of becoming the first Australian to win five successive races in the 500cc motorcycle world championships when the series continues in Italy next Sunday. There are still seven races to go in the series. If Doohan's success continues, 1994 might produce an Australian world champion. Let us hope so. Australians should be proud of their sporting heroes, particularly those who have pride in their nation and its symbols.

         Not only did Doohan take the chequered flag at yesterday's Dutch Grand Prix; he also proudly flew the Australian flag over his shoulder during his victory lap. His achievements and actions yesterday gained him the admiration of all Australians. The claim of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that our flag does not represent its nation or its people is totally wrong. When one of Australia's most popular young sporting heroes performs this act of patriotism for the entire world to see, it confirms how out of step the Prime Minister is, not only with Bob Hawke but also with the other people in this great nation.

          For many years this government has refused to act to help country people get justice with respect to the cost of fuel and LPG. In north-east Victoria, for example, people regularly have to pay 10c to 15c per litre more for their fuel than people in the metropolitan areas of Australia. There is a disparity due to freight, but that cannot be any more than 1c to 2c per litre. The government has had hundreds of representations, not only from people on this side of politics, but by members of the Labor caucus, and has not acted. In some cases the price of LPG in country areas of Victoria is almost double the price of LPG in metropolitan Melbourne.

         I wanted to pick up on a couple of points that had already been made about the current debate between Mr Hawke and the Prime Minister, but earlier today somebody warned me that it was very dangerous to get into a fight between two dogs because `you're likely to get bitten yourself'. To some extent I believe that is true. I am reluctant to get into the debate. I was also told that neither of them was terribly careful with the truth but, on balance, Mr Hawke might be slightly more careful with the truth than the Prime Minister.

         —Thank you for the opportunity of speaking again, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to continue the point about interest rates. I come from a constituency that has a large number of young families raising children who in many cases have quite substantial mortgages to pay off. In many cases they have mortgages of $90,000 to $100,000. If, as predicted by the Labor government, there are going to be interest rate rises in the near future—as is quite clear from what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said today, prior to going off for his jet set tour of Indonesia to kowtow to the Indonesian leader, when he gave the clearest indication for a long time that interest rate rises are imminent—a one per cent rise will mean that some people in my electorate will be faced with an extra $60 a month.

         If we have the rise predicted by experts such as the Westpac analysts or BIS Shrapnel of up to three per cent by the end of next year, I have constituents who will be paying up to $160 or more extra on their mortgage repayments to service their home loans. How can families that have already been hard hit by the recession, who are strapped by an income tax system that is totally biased against families raising children, possibly cope with the effects of interest rate rises of this enormity? If any of those members opposite who are not here today but who normally are here think that in the outer mortgage belt areas they are going to win seats, they are sadly mistaken.

Jeffrey Kennett has increased 4,345 taxes in Victoria while he has been in government, which has cost the ordinary Victorian family $1,600 more in taxes and charges. He has brought in the $100 poll tax on every home, which means that millionaires pay $100 and pensioners pay $100. He has doubled the electricity supply charge. He has increased gas charges. He has increased water charges. He has upped the petrol levy. He has increased stamp duty on car and house insurance. He has doubled the bank debit tax. He has increased TAFE fees.

Families with disabled children that need respite care primarily provided by government agencies have a new fee structure, with increases of up to—wait for it—1,310 per cent. That is how much he has increased the fees for people looking for respite care.

If I had been able to ask the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a question today then it would have been whether he would be prepared to raise the question of East Timor with the President of Indonesia while he was there. I am sure he will not. It is a matter for great shame, in my view, that the world, and Australia in particular, has stood by and watched the genocide that has occurred in that small country—or what was a country and now apparently is part of Indonesia. It is a documented fact that over 200,000 East Timorise have been killed since the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia in 1975. When we look at those people and realise how close they were as friends of ours, particularly during the Second World War, we ought to be ashamed.

         What a pity it is in many respects that Australian companies and individuals have to look elsewhere to invest. The Australian Labor Party and the policies it has brought in have clearly failed to encourage Australians to invest in their own country. The answer by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to a question in question time a couple of weeks ago was very hollow. He suggested that there was something wrong with those foreign investors who chose to invest in Australia.

         The fact is that much of Australia is being sold cheaply. Many people from overseas are seeing the bargains that are here, but that does not alter the fact that many Australians are clearly choosing to invest outside Australia. Whilst we on this side of the House do not want to necessarily discourage that, I make the observation that that is costing hundreds of thousands of Australians jobs. If the economic settings were right in this country, Australians would be choosing to invest in Australia. They would be encouraged to invest in Australia and by doing so they would be creating jobs for Australians.

         Although the latest current account figures showed a fall of $1.84 billion in net debt, the latest figures also show a huge $5.04 billion inflow of foreign equity investment. Those figures are the second highest on record.

         Foreign interests owned 21.2 per cent of total Australian business capital as at 30 June 1992. Many people regard that as being a very conservative estimate. I have seen others estimate the figure to be in excess of 30 per cent. That figure of 21.2 per cent as at 30 June 1992 is an increase from 16.6 per cent as at 30 June 1980. So there is clear evidence there—there was particular evidence in the last set of figures—that there is an increasing interest in overseas investors buying shares and taking up equity in Australian corporations.

         It may be possible to argue—I think the Treasurer attempted to do this in his answer to the question—the relative merits of debt versus equity. It may be possible to make a case that the movement from debt into equity is in some way beneficial. However, the bottom line when we add these two together—in an accounting sense that is the correct thing to do because what I am pointing to is Australia's total foreign indebtedness—is that Australia's total foreign liabilities now stand at $244 billion net. That is up from only $38 billion just under 10 years ago, at the end of the financial year 1981-82.

         The gross figure—if we talk in gross terms the figures are even more horrific—is $346.5 billion. That compares with a gross total foreign indebtedness of $55.1 billion at the end of 1981-82. I will make that point again. That is an increase from $55 billion just over 10 years ago to almost $350 billion today. If we break that amount down to an amount per capita, the debt is $20,000 for every person in Australia.

         It ought to concern every Australian that this government is continuing to sell off the farm at an alarming rate. We sometimes hear hollow and simple defences for that action, but when we look at the balance sheet of Australia in accounting terms, we see that it is crook. It is not a healthy balance sheet at all. Of course, balance sheets do not measure the potential that this country has to be great—I have no doubt that it does have the potential to be great—but in simple accounting terms the debt this country now has to others is enormous. It ought to concern every Australian and I believe that in the lead-up to the next election it will become a major issue as people finally realise the extent to which this country has been sold out by the government in the last 10 years.

         The other part of this equation is Australians' savings. Our savings rates are deplorably low. If we look at a table of national savings over a period, we see consistent falls since the mid-1970s peak of 26.8 per cent of GDP to only 15.8 per cent of GDP in 1992-93. By world standards this is an extremely low figure and it adds up to the fact that people in this country have been highly taxed and they have had their investment income taxed so they have been reluctant to invest, and they have been given expectations about having a funded retirement, which has been counterproductive in terms of savings.

         I am not arguing here—certainly the opposition would not be arguing for this—for financial regulation, although we must observe that in many respects deregulation has not worked effectively. Clearly, though, financial deregulation has allowed significant supplementation of domestic capital from overseas. Given the continuing fall in the domestic savings rate, either use of foreign capital had to expand or the Australian investment rate had to fall. Quite clearly we cannot have high consumption and high investment.

         The government has not set a very good example for the private sector. To take up the point of my good friend over here, we do have a significant public debt in this country so it is not correct to take the simplistic cop-out and say that it is all private debt. Even if it were all private debt it would still be a problem for this country, but the fact is that we now have a very significant public debt. Public debt is a collective liability of all present and, of more concern to me in a lot of respects, all future taxpayers as well.

         Net government demand for capital exceeding net private sector supply of capital has led to the importing of foreign capital by both the public and private sectors. That brings us back to the situation today, where so much pressure is being put on interest rates. When the government has to go out and finance a deficit of $11 billion—or perhaps closer to $18 billion, which it effectively is—then of course there is going to be pressure on interest rates. We are seeing plenty of evidence of that at the moment. The fact is that Australia is actually hooked on debt. There is little light at the end of the tunnel. The gap that has been made up by the steady rise in foreign ownership shares and other productive assets is not in Australia's best long-term interests. The government's failure to address the underlying causes of our alliance on foreign funds which, however it is rationalised, threaten our economic sovereignty is deplorable.

         —Given the multicultural nature of Australia, it is perhaps not surprising that all political parties welcome members from diverse ethnic backgrounds to their ranks, and the ALP is no exception to this. It is also true to say that, given the ethnic composition of Australia, their numbers are not fully reflected in the parliament of Australia. However, over recent months in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland there has emerged the disturbing tendency of people to work for their own political agendas in an attempt to manipulate some sections of the ethnic community. I believe this is called branch stacking.

         I speak with a degree of personal experience in this matter. The Macedonian community in the Illawarra is, in my view, being manipulated by some individuals—not all from within the Macedonian community—who are running a political agenda which, to their mind, would reach its climax with the replacement of me as the member for Throsby. Honourable members would be aware that, over recent years, three members of this chamber have consistently espoused the Macedonian cause, be it on the question of recognition, the term `former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia', the highly offensive term Slav Macedonia, the access of Australian Macedonians to consular facilities, the question of human rights, the way Macedonian minorities are reported to have been treated in other countries, or the amount of broadcast time on SBS for Macedonian programs in the Macedonian language.

         The three members have been the former member for Stirling, Mr Ron Edwards, my colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) and me. Each of us over many years has espoused the Macedonian cause, at some cost to ourselves. It is not always a popular cause to espouse, as the telephone calls I get in the middle of the night remind me. I make the point that I embraced the Macedonian cause not for political expediency but because I did believe and still believe in the justice of that cause. This has been especially true on the recognition issue. I believe that Macedonia met all the requirements for recognition. I also believe—as I have said in this chamber many times—that, given the large Macedonian population in Australia, Australia should have been among the first to recognise this country instead of being among the last.

In an attempt to ease the channels of communication to ministers and the federal parliament, I was instrumental in establishing the Australian parliamentarians Macedonian support group.

         Following a visit by Senator Bolkus to fulfil a longstanding invitation from the Cringila co-op in the electorate of Throsby, the Macedonian community has been manipulated into what is commonly known as branch stacking, or an anti-Hollis push. My colleague Senator Stephen Loosley wrote an interesting piece in yesterday's

         The Warrawong branch of the ALP has enjoyed quite a chequered history. Membership has widely fluctuated. During the past 12 months there have been great difficulties with gaining quorums for meetings, and monthly meetings of the branch have been abandoned for this very reason. In the past, there was talk of branch closure. We even changed the night the branch met to a Friday night, and we changed the venue.

         There were 11 stalwarts in that branch—two of them with a Maltese background, one was Macedonian, and the rest were Lebanese, five from one family. It is true to say that the Warrawong branch was the smallest and poorest ALP branch in my electorate. It was the one ALP branch which contributed nothing to the last federal election campaign. In fact, the president of the Warrawong branch approached me earlier this year to pay a levy charged by head office because the branch could not afford it.

         In two months this financially embarrassed, struggling multi-ethnic branch has gone from having a membership of 11 to having a membership in excess of 500. In one night, 318 people—all of Macedonian background—felt the urge to join the Australian Labor Party and did so at the Warrawong branch. The next month, over 150 joined. One suspects that the Warrawong branch has also gone from being one of the poorest branches to one of the richest, because the head office of the New South Wales ALP gave to the Warrawong branch a receipt for in excess of $4,000 for membership fees paid in cash.

People collected their forms there, filled them in and deposited them at the kebab shop next door—also Macedonian owned. Some of them did not quite understand what they were filling in. They were told to fill in the forms and, as they cost no money, they took them down to the community centre. In fact, some of them often rang my office and asked me about the form. The queue for the meeting—the attendance went from 11 to in excess of 318, complete with television cameras et al—stretched from the first floor right out into the street. People would progress up the stairs, and they were directed by two young spivs from Sydney who instructed them where to sign in the book. They then turned around and left the meeting.

It appears that my sin is that, when I went out to see what was happening—it was fairly obvious—and was interviewed by the television stations, I said that it was a disgraceful exhibition that did the Macedonian people, their cause or the Illawarra no credit.

It is somewhat ironic that the two local Macedonians most involved in the stacking are both funded by federal government grants.

I welcome new members of all ethnic backgrounds, as I believe all political parties do, but I do not believe that such blatant stacking does anyone anyone any credit at all. The issue of Macedonia is complex. It will not be sorted out in Australia; it will be sorted out but by Greece and Macedonia.

          —I am sorry that we cannot extend the time of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), as it was such an interesting speech on branch stacking in the ALP. I am sure that we could all learn from it. Today I would like, firstly—and solely, if I use up all my time—to address a problem that has arisen in my electorate in relation to the children's services program. This is a program of the Department of Human Services and Health, administered by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley).

          I will refer to the aims and objectives of the children's services program, as listed in a handout by the minister. The first priority is children whose parents are in the work force. The second priority—the second of four—is children or parents with a continuing disability or incapacity. It is against the law of this country for children with disabilities to be excluded from the child-care program. The out of school hours care program is a combination of the after school program and the vocation program. The laws of the Commonwealth of Australia state that discrimination is against the law. The second priority of the children's services program is that children with disabilities be included in this program.

          In the instructions relating to the program, at paragraph 6.4 `Enrolment of children', there are priority of access guidelines; that is, firstly, work force participation or training and, secondly, children with disabilities. The handbook for these organisations further mentions that the priorities to be considered within these groups are parents or children with disabilities. Taking this into consideration, I think we would all assume that a child with disabilities would have access to the out of school care or vocation care in South Australia. But that is not the case.

          We can go even further because we realise that children with disabilities may require extra care. There has been a lot of rhetoric from the department on supplementary services grants. These grants are to assist with out of school child care. The department provides examples where extra money—supplementary service grants—can be given. It states:

          South Australian children with disabilities do not have access to this program at all. The Ascot Park Primary School, a local school which runs an after school care program for children with disabilities, raised the problem of an autistic child whose mother works and who requires assistance to stay in the program. A staff of only two have to care for the normal range of children plus the autistic child, as he has special needs. They simply cannot do this without extra funding. No special funding has been available, despite every possible avenue that this school has gone through.

          In following up this matter, I thought there must be some mistake. It is written in black and white in these different forms, including the supplementary service grants, that this is a particular area of need to which money should be given. So I rang the office of the Minister for Family Services and asked whether supplementary service grants could be used on this occasion. The minister's office knew nothing about the supplementary service grants. I was given the phone number of the South Australian Department of Health and Community Services.

I rang the person concerned and asked about the grants. That person had not heard about the grants, but referred me to somebody else who had. I was assured that those grants would definitely be available for somebody with disabilities in after school child care.

          Recently, two macaws were imported into Australia. They were in quarantine in England, where one of the birds died. The other bird continued on its way into Australia, where it was diagnosed in quarantine in Australia as being ill. After being examined, no cause of illness could be found. It was then given injections of hormones and antibiotics and released into Australia. Subsequently, it died of a disease known as macaws wasting disease. Macaws are parrots. Parrots have a general genetic composition in common in the Southern Hemisphere and can pass diseases from one parrot species to another. So had that parrot had some contact with our native parrot population, it could have passed on this macaws wasting disease.

          While my specific interest is in the environment, I followed this matter up. I found that the reason for the importation of these birds was simply so that those people who already had exotic birds in Australia could increase their genetic pools. As laudable an aim as this may be, I do not think in any circumstances it justifies Australians bringing parrots or other birds into Australia with a quarantine period which is obviously not long enough to look at this disease. The quarantine stations focus on diseases in poultry and not diseases in Australia's wildlife, specifically Australia's parrots. I grieve today that such a thing should be allowed to occur. I ask the minister to look at this matter in the interests of the future of Australia's wild bird population.

         —I do so much work. There is one particular event that I draw to the attention of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, who is at the table. The RTA Big New South Wales Bike Ride is coming to my electorate of Gilmore. It will be the first time it has come to a federal electorate. It is the first time a federal member has sought it and, with the local councils, put together and won a bid.

         That may seem well and good and not very newsworthy, but I contend that an event which costs between $600,000 and $700,000 to stage will result in a significant economic influx to my electorate of Gilmore. My region will receive an immediate economic stimulus because of the money that will be spent there. There is more. The electorate will receive exposure in a tourism sense. People who live quite close to us are going to see some of the treasures of my electorate that they did not know about.

         Leonie Watman, the events organiser for Bicycle New South Wales, and Simon Roundtree, the events coordinator for the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Australia, toured the route with me and spoke to the mayors, councils, chambers of commerce, leading citizens and various groups such as the police, firemen and other emergency service groups. We did this so that we could start the planning and highlight the economic benefits that will flow from the event which will come through my area in the first week of March next year.

         This is the first stage in a long process. I will have my electorate wound up and looking forward to benefits that can be obtained from the Olympic Games in the year 2000. It is our estimate that the first travellers will come to our shores in 1996. There will be a trailing off in travellers after the year 2000 and we will probably still see the effect of the Olympic Games to the year 2001 or 2002. I sincerely hope that the tourist operators and those involved in business within my electorate will be finely tuned by that stage. I hope we will have gone through the RTA Big New South Wales Bike Ride with such a degree of cooperation and enthusiasm that we will be able to package and market our area for the bigger prize—the dollars that will come to Australia as a result of the Olympic Games.

         None of this was ever mentioned in the recent publicity. The media did not want to know about this. When I first started to put the idea forward, there was some degree of ridicule. Some in the media were saying, `What is this federal member doing pushing for something like this for his area?' I will continue to push for this event. I will continue to push for things like the aero modelling world championships to come to my electorate. That is a $3 1/2 million event. These events may not be the Olympic Games or at the cutting edge of huge international events, but they are very significant for electorates like mine.

         Secondly, I refer to the work I have done in changing the opinion of the council on where sewage should go. When I became the member for Gilmore on 13 March 1993, the Shoalhaven City Council had a policy that it was going to put all its sewage effluent out to sea. It had a bogus community discussion program which basically said, `We'd like to put it somewhere else but we're going to have to put it out to sea because it is much cheaper than any of the other options.'

         It has taken over 12 months, some very hard ball and some very hard discussions to come to the point where the Shoalhaven City Council has abandoned its plans to put effluent into the ocean. I know what the minister at the table, who is a keen fisherman and who has congratulated me on the two four-kilogram snappers and the two 2 1/2-kilogram snappers that I have managed to catch in the last four weeks, thinks about the prospect of people eating fish that were caught in areas polluted by sewage.

         —The fish in my electorate are large and clean. The bottom line is that, through a novel and lateral thinking approach, we have managed to look at employment potential that effluent management can achieve for my people. That means the re-use of effluent on farm properties and farm forests. These are not innovations that I have made. They are not new in the Australian context, but they are new to some people within my electorate. The attitude that anything which is not the way it has been done for the last 50 years in Sydney is not on is finally dying. We actually have people within my electorate who can see the use in protecting new industries, such as the mariculture, which I am sure the minister is deeply concerned about. Mariculture is a growing industry which involves the farming of fish in the oceans. It is very dependent on the cleanliness of the water.

The council is still not convinced. It still thinks it has to have an ocean outfall for sewage. That is not the case.

The fact that this term of council has had the first woman mayor and the second woman mayor, ever, in 127 years of local government, I would suggest is relevant to women getting the vote. The fact that Kiama now has a woman mayor, I would have thought, would have made it even more relevant. Does the editor of the

          —I wish to bring two matters to the attention of the House. The first concerns the decline in the standards of Australia Post's mail delivery service from capital cities to country areas and the second the practice of operating double standards in the delivery of Telecom Australia services. Is this House aware that Australia Post's nationally agreed and accepted standard for letter deliveries from city to country areas is now three days? The service to country areas was considerably faster than that 34 years ago, as one of my constituents in Donnybrook, a town in the south west of Western Australia, will confirm. He informs me that the mail was delivered from Perth by steam train and arrived promptly at his office each morning at 8.30 a.m. His office was in the habit of opening the mail, dealing immediately with the urgent matters by the time of the next postal collection at 1.00 p.m. and could confidently expect the mail to be delivered in Perth promptly the next morning.

          With all the modern technology available in this day and age, Australia Post now accepts that a satisfactory service between Perth and Donnybrook is a three-day delivery time. In fact, there are a number of instances where it has taken longer. On one occasion a letter posted on Tuesday did not reach South Perth post office until the following Monday morning. Mail sent from Bunbury to Albany in the south of my electorate has to first travel 200 kilometres north to Perth before being sent southward again past Bunbury to Albany.

          The second matter I wish to raise concerns the standards of service available to country Telecom users. Last year, Telecom Australia announced in a blaze of publicity that it was spending $3.3 billion on new telecommunications infrastructure. A program of network modernisation and expansion would `springboard Australia into the 21st century', according to a senior Telecom officer. Western Australia was promised a $313 million boost as a result of the new future mode of operations, FMO, program, which was hailed as a revolution in our telecommunications system.

          The new high-tech system would give users of services: itemised call records; call wait, which notifies a user that a second caller is on the line; call divert facilities; call control, which allows a personal identification number to be used; and a delayed hotline, a facility frequently used by the frail and the aged in an emergency, which automatically dials up a program number when the receiver is picked up.

          This major cash injection also promised to provide malice call tracing facilities, abbreviated dialling, third party conferencing and various other facilities that have become commonplace in Australia's  capital cities. But while Telecom may appear to have its sights firmly set on the future, a large constituent of its rural customers are firmly of the opinion that Telecom's headlong plunge into high technology has left them completely out in the cold. For thousands of rural customers in my electorate, Telecom's technological advances are not contributing in any way at all to an improved standard of service for them.

          There is still a very large number of customers in the south west and the great southern regions of Western Australia who are denied access to the sorts of Telecom services that metropolitan subscribers have taken for granted for many years. They are denied access to itemised billing, to Easycall and to other network based facilities. Quite simply, the perception in country areas is that they are treated by Telecom as minority, second-class customers who have to accept a second-rate service.

          What is even worse, many of those country customers face a further delay of four or five years before they can enjoy the benefits of the changeover from analog to digital telephone exchanges. To the north of my electorate is the rural town of Brunswick Junction. Telecom services to Brunswick Junction are poor. Subscribers are forced to tolerate frequent faults, do not have access to itemised billing and, to make matters worse, they have been disappointed on a number of occasions when Telecom has made assurances that the local exchange would be updated only to later abandon those assurances.

          With the rapid advances being made in telecommunications technology, it is incomprehensible that Telecom can operate a two-class system, one high cost and high-tech for city customers, with the other barely an advance on the clumsy, makeshift system our grandparents used. Country people have had to tolerate a declining service coupled with increasing costs. Country public telephone boxes have been removed, public phone box call charges have been increased, and on 1 June I understand that Telecom also wants to slap a four per cent increase on local call charges.

          As if this is not enough, country users now have to pay for out-of-area telephone directories to be delivered. Previously they were provided free by Telecom. When I raised this matter with Telecom I was told:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The number of outlets for out-of-area directories under the previous system made it extremely difficult to estimate customer demand with any degree of accuracy. With over 1,300 post offices and some 2,600 postal agencies nationally, the opportunity for waste in both transport and raw materials is greatly increased if demand is overestimated.
        </para>
        <para>
         Surely Telecom can estimate waste just as easily by developing a more accurate estimating process. I am quite sure, for example, that country users would not object to placing their orders on a toll-free number if they could continue to receive free directories.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The other point raised by country constituents is Telecom's assumption that a Perth telephone directory is an out-of-area directory for country users. Many agricultural machinery manufacturers are based in Perth. If parts or supplies cannot be sourced locally, a Perth office can be found in the Perth telephone directory and goods freighted down overnight with a minimum of delay to the farm business. To many people in the rural community, access to the Perth market is an essential part of their business and is not an out-of-area service extra, as Telecom attempts to make it. Similarly, the rapidly expanding tourism market in the south west and great southern regions has to have access to the state's capital city, not just for its visitors—the bulk of whom come from Perth—but for a great deal of its essential supplies.

          Telecom has consistently failed to understand that country people rely on an efficient, reliable telephone service far more than people in capital cities. To the rural community the telephone is a vital link, to the agricultural and tourism industries especially. It is the single most important piece of business equipment. It makes business possible, and country customers have every right to expect the same standard of service enjoyed by their city counterparts.

          In the south west of my electorate, in Albany—which students of Australian history such as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will know, was the first part of Western Australia to be settled—Telecom has still not provided a fully itemised billing facility for all the town's telephone customers. Changeover to a fully digital exchange, with all the services and facilities that will provide, is not scheduled until the 1998-99 financial year. At this point it might be useful to quote Telecom's group general manager of networking technology, Mr Doug Campbell, who said:

        <para>
         What he did not say is that the world will have to wait up to five years to get a welcome mat from the south west and great southern regions. Speaking from a business background, I can assure Mr Campbell that business opportunities do not hang around for five years for people to act on them. Neither Telecom nor Australia Post has any right to expect country users to tolerate these double standards. For all the so-called advances being made, services are simply not being improved and the cost of those services is certainly not coming down for country users.

          If, by highlighting these severe communication problems, I have given the impression that they have not taken place in one of Australia's remote areas, let me correct that impression. The south west and great southern regions of Western Australia are amongst the fastest growing areas in the state. The south west attracts more than one million tourists a year, who contribute $219 million to the region's economy.

         —Today I want to draw the attention of this House to the problem of so-called funny money on Green and Fitzroy Islands which continues to cause offence to many of my constituents in Far North Queensland. For generations, residents have made daytrips out to Green Island. Glass-bottom boats have been used to view the beauty of the reef from Green Island as far back as the 1930s. Green Island is a coral cay and it is the oldest nature reserve in the Great Barrier Reef region, having been declared a national park in 1937 and a marine park in 1974 under Queensland legislation. It has also been used a boat building yard and a fishing retreat from the earliest days of settlement in the Cairns area.

         Fitzroy Island is a continental island off Yarrabah. It is a beautiful rainforest clad island that has also been a long-time popular destination for Cairns residents and tourists alike. Both islands have resort and visitor facilities that are leased to a foreign owned company, Daikyo, which operates the very successful Great Adventures tourism packages.

         Since I have been the member for Leichhardt, I have heard rumblings in the community about the so-called funny money being obligatory on Green and Fitzroy Islands. The point at issue is aptly put in a letter from a constituent who wrote to me earlier this month. It reads:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am in possession of Australian currency, the notes of which all bear the phrase, `Legal tender throughout Australia and its Territories.' Why, then am I not permitted to use this currency on Green and Fitzroy Islands in exchange for goods? Why must I exchange my currency for another before I can purchase any goods? Have Green and Fitzroy Islands become separated from Australia?
       </para>
       <para>
        My constituent goes on to ask why Australian currency is not valid on these islands. That is a very good question indeed. The questions put to me in this letter by my constituent are typical of questions asked by the thousands of Cairns residents who visit Green Island and find to their surprise that the Australian currency in their wallets will not buy them a seat on a glass-bottom boat. It will not even buy them a beer or a hamburger.

         I have been to Green Island and I have seen the currency exchange booths located right throughout the resort area. If people want to buy anything on the island, from a diving trip to a packet of chips, they have to use Daikyo's so-called adventure vouchers. The vouchers are not Japanese yen, although rumours to that effect have whipped around Cairns at various times. According to Daikyo's publicity blurb, the adventure vouchers:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . will be for exclusive use on all Great Adventures cruises and on Green and Fitzroy Island. You'll be able to buy anything you need from drinks and food to souvenirs to dive courses with the vouchers. So you won't need cash.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Adventure vouchers are equal in value to the Australian dollar. You'll be able to buy individual vouchers or books of vouchers.
       </para>
       <para>
        People can get a refund on any vouchers they have not spent at the end of their tropical sojourn. Cairns residents are asking why Great Adventures has introduced this money exchange system. I am not into conspiracy theories. There is no question of Daikyo taking over Australia or subverting our sovereignty. In my opinion, the only logical reason for Daikyo introducing the voucher system is that it makes money for the company. Successful corporations are dollar driven, and Daikyo is a very successful corporation. So one can only assume that the voucher system works to improve the corporation's profit margins, and this can only be at the expense of the consumer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Obviously, Daikyo hopes that its customers will leave with adventure vouchers still in their pockets or take the funny money home as a souvenir. One of the selling points of the voucher system is that the holders of the vouchers get a five per cent discount on all purchases. This strikes me as quite bizarre. If Daikyo has a monopoly control over pricing on the islands and people can buy goods or services only with adventure vouchers, the benefit of a five per cent discount seems rather illusory.

         Nevertheless, I have heard Cairns locals argue for the right to use Australian currency at the bar on Green Island, encouraged by other more gullible patrons to change their money so that they can get the fantastic five per cent discount. The locals in question decided to leave their drinks untouched on the bar rather than change their money. Such is the depth of local discontent with the voucher system that I will write to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) seeking advice on whether the adventure voucher system infringes any consumer protection laws.

         This brings me to the next big question constantly asked by Cairns residents: is the money exchange system legal? I have received a copy of a standard response to this question from the Reserve Bank. The response, which is truly worthy of Sir Humphrey, reads:

        Legal tender law relates only to the settlement of existing debts. Trades may specify the form in which they will accept settlement for their services or products before the `contract' is entered into. For example, here in Sydney there are signs on the approaches to the Harbour Bridge saying that 1c, 2c and 5c coins will not be accepted in payment of the toll. We do not know the background to why the operators of some island resorts do not wish to handle Australian currency notes. They are, however, entitled to use their own voucher system if they wish, provided, of course, that they do not contravene the Reserve Bank Act, the Crimes (Currency) Act or any other legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The analogy with the Sydney Harbour Bridge toll misses the point completely. The toll is demanded in Australian currency. If Sydney drivers had to hand over bottle tops, monopoly money or adventure vouchers to a foreign owned corporation, the analogy would be meaningful. I am sure that regular bridge users in Sydney would be just as outraged as Cairns locals are about the Great Adventures voucher system.

         The last paragraph of the letter from the Reserve Bank raises the question: just what contravenes the Reserve Bank Act, the Crimes (Currency) Act or any other legislation? Section 44(1) of the Reserve Bank Act under the heading, `Other persons not to issue notes', states that `a person shall not issue a bill or a note for the payment of money payable to bearer on demand and intended for circulation'. The Crimes (Currency) Act is concerned mainly with making counterfeit money and counterfeit securities. I might also add that section 23 of the Currency Act 1965 is relevant here, but I do not think that I have time to quote that.

         I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that the money exchange system is illegal and I am not raising this matter in any way to discredit Daikyo. As I said earlier, Daikyo has been a huge contributor to the Cairns economy and is a big employer in the city. I have raised these matters because they understandably concern many of my constituents. I can assure members of this House that the subject has raged long and furious on Cairns talkback radio and in pubs and workplaces in the city.

         Cairns tour operators—I think the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) will back me up here—assured me that it is also a constant topic of conversation with visitors to the Great Barrier Reef. It is not stretching the point too much to say that, if not resolved, it has the potential to affect the image of Far North Queensland amongst potential domestic tourists. For these reasons, I believe that the matter should be clarified in the near future. Even if the practice of issuing these funny money notes is not illegal, I take the opportunity in this grievance debate to call on Daikyo to abandon its practice of using funny money consistent with its other actions as a good corporate citizen of Cairns and Far North Queensland.

          —by leave—Mr Deputy Speaker, the report I have just presented concerns a reference given to the committee by the House following bans placed by members of the Communication Workers Union on the delivery of mail to the electorate offices of members. This matter was first raised by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). In addition, the Leader of the National Party (Mr Fischer) and the honourable members for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and Braddon (Mr Miles) made representations to the Speaker concerning the bans.

          In the course of its inquiry on this matter my committee received submissions from the national secretary of the Communication Workers Union, from the Leader of the National Party, and from the honourable member for Adelaide. In addition, oral evidence was received from the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). We were grateful to those members who made submissions.

          The key facts in this matter were not in dispute: commencing on 8 December 1993 the delivery of mail to the electorate offices of a number of members ceased. Further, it is not disputed that this arose as a result of decisions taken by members of the Communication Workers Union. Each of the members who put views to the committee outlined the effect of the industrial action on the work of their electorate offices. An important point was made by the honourable member for Indi, who made it clear that his concerns were not so much about any effects of the bans on him in a personal sense but rather that ordinary citizens were deprived of the ability to communicate with their elected representatives.

          Mr Paul Watson, National Secretary of the Communication Workers Union, advised the committee that the action taken by his union was not intended as, or taken in the knowledge of it being considered as, a breach of privilege. He said that the union `had expressed dismay' at the cabinet decision in relation to an Industry Commission inquiry into mail services. He said that the union initially contemplated widespread industrial action which would have caused great public disruption during the pre-Christmas period. The union had subsequently decided on a more limited form of action which would have an impact and demonstrate the level of concern amongst its membership. The union stated that it was believed that members were not fully aware of the consequences of the government decision, and it was felt that the union action would bring the concerns home in a meaningful way.

          The committee has been satisfied that the ability of a number of members to perform what they accepted as their duties to constituents was impeded as a result of the actions complained of. As it happens, the committee is not aware of any particular case of what may be regarded as a substantial harm or damage was caused to a member of to any constituent, but it is clear that the bans had the potential to cause a serious problem. The committee recognises, as a predecessor committee did several years ago, that:

         The difficulty is to distinguish between what may be regarded as reasonable or acceptable forms of expression and protest and those which go beyond this and constitute harassment or obstruction of members in the discharge of their duties.

          In our view, actions such as the bans in question go beyond what the House should be prepared to tolerate. These particular actions have caused inconvenience to members and to ordinary citizens and do not represent an acceptable means of expression of concern. In the present case the committee has found that although it would be open to it to make adverse findings in respect of those responsible, it has not done so, having regard to the apparent ignorance of the relevant law on the part of those responsible, to the apparent absence of any intention to offend, and to the fact that the disruption caused was of a limited duration. I commend the report to the House. It deals with a difficult but important issue.

          The principle contained within the institution of parliamentary privilege is an extremely important one. Contrary to those who believe it has reached its use-by date, it continues to fulfil an essential role within our system of parliamentary democracy and a fundamentally important role to make it possible for people in this chamber and in the other chamber to take up those issues which they, in conscience, believe it is their responsibility to take up and to be beholden to no-one, except perhaps to the parliament itself. However, the principle of parliamentary privilege will survive only while it is respected by parliamentarians and the parliament. It can survive only if it is not abused and if it is not used as a vehicle to provide protections for parliament and parliamentarians which are outside the narrow focus of its purposes and which are not available to other members of the community.

          The circumstances addressed by this report of the Privileges Committee concern bans which were imposed by the  Communication Workers Union on the delivery of mail to and dispatch of mail from the offices of members of parliament in December 1993. The issues involved in this matter go to the heart of parliamentary privilege and the question of how it should be interpreted and applied.

         Parliamentary privilege relates to the special rights and immunities which belong to the Parliament, its Members and others, which are considered essential for the operation of the Parliament.

         There are three important points to note about that statement. Firstly, for `members', the reference is to their `responsibilities'. Secondly, for `others', the reference is to their `duties and responsibilities'. Thirdly, privileges are not the prerogative of members in their personal capacities.

          The House of Commons has always adopted a more restricted interpretation of privilege and contempt than that which the House of Representatives has chosen to adopt. In the House of Commons, care has always been taken to ensure that there is a connection between any action complained of and—I underline the next word—proceedings in the House or a committee. If there is no such connection, the matter is taken no further. Thus, in a case like the postal ban issue, it would never have been referred to the House of Commons committee of privileges.

          The Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, which is quite explicit in its reference to privilege, states:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Conduct (including the use of words) does not constitute an offence against a House unless it amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the full exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions, or with the full performance by a Member of the Member's duties as a Member.
        </para>
        <para>
         Thus, we have enshrined in legislation a wider interpretation of privilege than that ever adopted in practice by the House of Commons. That is perfectly legitimate except that the interpretation of privilege now hangs on the meaning of `member's duties'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In this context it is important to note, firstly, that the legislation refers to the full performance by a member of the member's duties as a member. Thus, it does not have to be generalised conduct affecting all members; it can and does include conduct which affects the full performance of any single member's duties. Secondly, it also includes the reference to the `member's duties as a member'. Thirdly, it does not use the expression `responsibilities' but the much more restrictive expression `duties'. How then can we interpret `member's duties'?
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          `Duties' may be either moral duties or legal duties. I believe that we must dispense with moral duties from inclusion in the protection of privilege, because all members would see their moral duties as members differently. The Parliamentary Privileges Act states that for conduct against a member to constitute an offence it must interfere with the full performance of a member's duties. I underline and emphasise the phrase `a member's duties'. May states that the `House will proceed against those who obstruct members in the discharge of their responsibilities to the House'. I underline and emphasise the word `will'.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Taking those two references together, the inclusion of `moral duties' in the interpretation of `duties' would mean that the House would be required to act whenever the moral duties of any single member were obstructed. Some actions which some members may see as their `moral duties' as a member of parliament have included, or could include, illegally trespassing on Commonwealth property to protest against nuclear arms issues; illegally committing acts to prevent damage to the environment or to prevent certain developments; and attending religious services, political meetings and social activities of various kinds.

          Would or should we consider any `conduct' which is `likely to amount' to an improper interference with the `full performance by a member' of his or her moral duties as a breach of privilege in connection with which the `House will proceed against those who obstruct members'? Clearly not; the proposition is absurd. Thus, the interpretation of `member's duties' is clearly intended to relate, and can only be interpreted as relating, to a member's legal duties.

          There are at least two legal duties of a member which immediately come to mind: to attend sittings of the House; and to provide a statement of registrable interests to the registrar. There are probably others. In connection with the postal ban imposed on members of parliament by the Communications Workers Union, it must be realised that it is not a legal duty for members to receive mail; it is not a legal duty for members to read or otherwise process mail; and it is not a legal duty for members to reply to correspondence. Clearly, all sensible and conscientious members will do these things and many others in fulfilling their responsibilities or functions, but they are not legal duties of members.

          Successive Speakers of the House of Representatives have placed their own interpretations on what constitutes or contributes towards a breach of privilege. In 1978, the Speaker concluded that a strike which affected the whole of Canberra and was not directed solely at the parliament did not constitute a prima facie case of breach of privilege. In 1985, the Acting Speaker concluded that union bans affecting all mail and which did not subject members to particular action in their capacity as members did not constitute a prima facie case of breach of privilege.

As I have said, the fact that the bans were directed specifically at members should have been, on the basis of both practice and law, of no consequence.

          I have disputed whether interference with members' mail would affect their capacity to perform their legal duties.

          The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) raised the issue of the postal ban in the House of Representatives on 13 December 1993. He suggested that it seemed to him to be a clear breach of privilege, presumably supported by the fact that the ban was directed specifically against members of parliament. However, action under neither the provisions of privilege nor contempt requires or is assisted by any singling out of members.

          The letter of the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) dated 25 January 1994 to the chairman of the Committee of Privileges gave reasons why the postal ban may have involved breaches of the Australian Postal Corporation Act and the Commonwealth Crimes Act. However, apart from quite legitimate concerns about `democratic process', `improper' action, `inappropriate' industrial action, unanswered mail and Christmas deadlines, there is not substantial support for the claim that her legal duties as a member of parliament were improperly interfered with.

          The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) wrote to the Committee of Privileges and detailed the actions of his office in relation to the ban. He said that a large amount of mail was delayed in the critical pre-Christmas period. He said that the ban was a `restriction on electors' access to members of parliament and, as such, restricted members of parliament from carrying out their duties on behalf of electors'. Although the honourable member used the word `duties', he also gave it a wide meaning.

          The honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) gave oral evidence to the committee. He indicated that he was more concerned about the effect of the ban on his constituents than any inconvenience it may have caused him. He said that it involved `grossly improper pressure' on MPs to influence policy. He said that he thought `a parliament should, through the process of its privileges committee, stand up for people'. He expressed concerns about the rights of private citizens, especially in the context of communicating with their elected representatives. He said that he considered it his duty `as an elected member of parliament to respond to mail'. While the concerns of the honourable member would probably be shared by all MPs, it is doubtful whether they are best addressed via the principle of parliamentary privilege.

          There appears little doubt that a more conscious effort needs to be taken to ensure that the protection afforded members of parliament by parliamentary privilege is not expanded consciously, unconsciously or by default to the point where it is considered to be breached simply because a member's capacity to fulfil an accepted function is deliberately interfered with. It is quite clear that the term `a member's duties as a member' needs to be clarified and defined. We should not allow its meaning to be progressively extended in an ad hoc and piecemeal way simply to satisfy the wishes of members to expand the shield of parliamentary privilege for their own comfort, security and protection.

          —by leave—The report which I have just tabled refers to the proposed construction of an Australian Embassy complex in Hanoi, Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The proposal includes a new chancery, a head of mission residence, staff apartments and recreational facilities. The estimated cost of the project is $23.605 million at March 1994 prices.

          The current Australian Embassy in Hanoi consists of a two-storey French style villa used as a chancery, adjoining villas on either side and a purpose built block of staff apartments. There is also a swimming pool and a recreation area. One of the two adjoining villas is the ambassador's residence and the other contains staff apartments. The chancery was first occupied in 1978 and the two adjoining buildings were occupied in 1991 after extensive renovations. Although the chancery building has been extensively renovated by Australian tradespeople and completely rewired, maintenance of the building remains a constant problem. The chancery is unfortunately already too small for current requirements and will be converted into a senior staff apartment as part of this proposal.

          The Overseas Property Group has accorded the Hanoi project a high priority among proposed capital works projects because of the inadequacy of both the office and residential accommodation. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade endorses the construction of the new custom built chancery and the official residence as it believes it will make an invaluable contribution to promote Australia's identity in Vietnam and will demonstrate Australia's firm commitment to developing a substantial long-term relationship with Vietnam.

          The lifting of the United States economic and trade embargos against Vietnam has opened the way for resumption of lending to that country by the international financial institutions and major bilateral donors such as Japan. These developments will stimulate economic growth in Vietnam, and this will bring increasing commercial opportunities for Australian companies. This will place increasing demands on the Australian Embassy in Hanoi which is already operating at what can only be described as beyond full stretch in servicing the current level of relations.

          In addition to a new chancery and official residence, it is proposed to construct a four-storey apartment block. The existing staff accommodation is below standard and there is a lack of appropriate alternative accommodation available on the open market. Where residential accommodation is obtainable, extensive refurbishment is required. However, refurbishment costs are high and even the best accommodation may still be substandard after refurbishment has been completed. The construction of well-built accommodation within the chancery compound will enhance the physical security of staff while also providing for emergency power and filtered water supplies. There will also be significant savings in the long term to the Commonwealth resulting from rental savings and lower maintenance costs.

          Hanoi has few recreational facilities available for staff. There are no clubs and there are very few sporting facilities of a suitable standard for casual hire. The present chancery compound has a small recreational area with a swimming pool. The recreational facilities in the new complex will include a tennis court, swimming pool and squash court. The committee is satisfied that these facilities are fully justified in Hanoi which the committee was advised is an extremely difficult living and working environment.

          The site for the complex is located in an area of Hanoi which is being developed as a diplomatic enclave and already accommodates a number of diplomatic missions and their associated residential apartments. The committee was initially somewhat surprised to discover that the site is currently part of a small freshwater lake as indeed are all non-developed sites in this area. The site, which will be reclaimed, has an area of 1.17 hectares and will be leased from the Vietnamese government for a period of 60 years.

          The committee sought an assurance from the Overseas Property Group that the construction of the embassy complex on reclaimed land would not present difficulties. The Overseas Property Group advised the committee that it believed that the site would be suitable although further geotechnical advice will be sought and there could be a cost loading for the extensive piling system required. The Overseas Property Group advised the committee that the presence of unexploded ordnance on the site was not expected. However, the committee has recommended that a metal detector survey of the site should be undertaken before construction commences as a precaution against the possible presence of unexploded ordnance.

          While the committee welcomes the construction of this project, it is fair to say that the committee is somewhat disappointed with the design of the complex. The committee was advised by the Overseas Property Group that, in large measure, the design was influenced by the characteristics of the local building industry in Hanoi which has a combination of comparatively cheap and unskilled labour with a high work ethic—it sounds like my own area! The industry is labour intensive, with minimal mechanical equipment being available. Therefore, all proposed embassy buildings will be simple in form and structure to make allowances for the local building industry both in relation to short-term construction requirements and longer term maintenance factors.

          One difficulty that we as a committee face when we come to pontificate on such buildings is that it is almost a fait accompli before we receive the plan. We receive the proposed building plan and we do not have a chance, at this stage, to have an input into the design of the building. To achieve the necessary building quality it will be essential that expatriate trade and specialist services supervision form part of the construction program. All imported materials will come through the port of Haiphong which could become an area of delay to the project as trade activity increases.

          While the committee understands and accepts the practical constraints which led to the design solution for the Hanoi complex, it does not believe that the design reflects the positive and dynamic image which Australia should be projecting in Asia. The committee is of the view that the Overseas Property Group should hold a design competition when a project of this nature is being developed in future. The committee believes that the Overseas Property Group does not have an underlying design philosophy which would enable its architectural consultants to express a sense of an Australian identity in building projects. The committee has recommended that the Overseas Property Group should develop such an underlying design philosophy.

          There must be many architects who would be only too willing to submit a design for a proposed Australian Embassy with the prestige associated with such a work in many parts of the world. I personally wonder what the architect is trying to achieve with this fairly pedestrian complex. I know that design is often an individual issue. Our embassies around the world and our chanceries are a mishmash of designs. Few reflect an Australian image. I think a couple of the better ones are the Beijing complex and the building under construction in Suva. These buildings are fine but many of the others leave a lot to be desired.

          This building that we are now recommending to this parliament is like something out of the 1950s. We were told by the architect and by the Overseas Property Group that we were not to be too ostentatious, overelaborate or overprestigious. We most certainly have achieved that. It is a breezeblock building like something out of the 1950s. It is a very plain building but, I guess, it is a functional building. It will add absolutely nothing to the architectural merit of Hanoi and Australia's image.

I dread to think what image we will present to people who see the new embassy complex in Hanoi. We are not asking for an overelaborate building, but we are asking for something a little more updated than the 1950s and something that would portray the sort of image of Australia that I thought we as a parliament were trying to project in Asia.

          Following recent construction experience in Beijing, Jakarta and Phnom Penh, and in order to achieve the desired project quality, it is envisaged that a considerable number of Australian trade and specialist supervisory personnel will be employed during the construction phase. The successful contractor will be required to specify and use Australian products wherever possible. Australian manufactured furniture will be used throughout all buildings. Overseas Property Group expects that the material components will be 80 per cent Australian content.

          As I indicated earlier, the total cost of the project is $23.605 million. However, it is interesting to note that there will be no impact on the budget as funds will be made available from the sale of properties in Singapore. Overseas Property Group advised the committee that the sale of the properties in Singapore will also finance the construction of a chancery in Islamabad, the refurbishment of Australia House in London, the purchase of land for housing in Shanghai and also the construction of a modern residence for the Australian High Commissioner in Singapore. I am only hopeful that Overseas Property Group gets as much money for the sale as it thinks it is going to get.

          In view of the difficulties likely to be experienced in the construction of the project, the committee sought an assurance from Overseas Property Group that the cost of the project would not rise significantly, as was the case in Beijing. Overseas Property Group stated that, unlike the Beijing project, an Australian project manager would be appointed with Overseas Property Group taking control of the project from the initial stages. In Beijing, Overseas Property Group was tied to a Chinese construction company and also did not have direct control of the project. I commend the report to the House.

          The message purports to repeat the requests for amendments contained in message No. 266 which the House rejected at its sitting on 30 May 1994. The House of Representatives has never accepted that the Senate has a right to repeat and thereby press or insist on a request for an amendment in a bill which the Senate may not amend. The question as to the justiciability of the Senate purportedly pressing a request by repetition is uncertain.

         —In relation to the requests for amendments from the Senate to the Student Assistance Amendment Bill, the coalition is opposed to the course which has been elaborated by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) briefly this afternoon because we believe they, in effect, will seek to hold the government to a commitment it made to the Australian people, and to students across this country, in the budget of last year and in documentation which arose from that budget. In a sense, when one looks at this matter one can quite clearly see that there was a commitment made by the government at that time.

         I will briefly touch on the background to this matter. This matter arose from last year's budget and from statements which were made in a series of documents pursuant to that budget that, in effect, if a person held a health care card then, so far as the assets test under Austudy was concerned, that assets test would be waived. This statement, or this commitment, on behalf of the government was made on at least four occasions. The first occasion was in a departmental budget kit for student assistance after last year's budget. This kit clearly set it out in these terms:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        From 1994, special assessment will be extended to students whose parents hold a current health care card. Such students will qualify for Austudy without parental income and assets test.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, if you are the holder of a health care card which does not carry with it an assets test you would be able to obtain Austudy without that assets test as well. That statement in the kit was followed by a media release from the Department of Employment, Education and Training on 13 September last year, which stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Effective January 1, 1994 students from families holding a Health Care Card will qualify for maximum AUSTUDY entitlements, with means and assets tests waived. This measure is especially beneficial to low income families which are not on Department of Social Security or Veterans' Affairs benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly, a statement from the Department of Employment, Education and Training has set out the same information—namely, that the holder of a health care card will qualify for Austudy and that the assets test would otherwise be waived. So on two occasions, in two documents officially from the department, this commitment has been made.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Following those documents there was the release of the 1994 Austudy guide. The 1994 Austudy guide is a glossy publication which is published jointly by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the National Union of Students. In numerous places in this glossy publication, this official guide to students—and their parents around Australia—seeking to apply for Austudy, information is set out to the effect that, once again, holders of health care cards will have the assets test waived. One of the paragraphs in the Austudy guide states:

        So on the third piece of documentation from the department we have a clear indication of the government's commitment. Finally, if when going through the Austudy application form people tick `yes' when it comes to indicating whether they hold a health care card, they miss having to provide any information required in relation to assets. On the face of the application form for Austudy, holders of health care cards do not have to provide information relating to their assets. That supports the documentation previously released by the department.

         This was the situation up until early February of this year. On 7 February some of the student assistant offices around the country, and parents and students who had applied to Austudy pursuant to this provision, found out that, where the assets test had not previously been complied with, that would no longer be the case. The first public indication of this was a report in the

         of 15 February of this year. I mention it because it quite clearly shows the minister making a response to this matter that differs from his response this afternoon and on previous occasions. The report, headed `Austudy rethink may hit farmers', states:

        In the first public response to this matter we have a spokesman for the minister saying that `the government intends to honour its policy'. What is the policy or the commitment that has been set out in no less than four documents emanating from the Department of Employment, Education and Training? On the face of those documents, it is that, for the purposes of Austudy applications, the assets test is waived for holders of a health care card.

         As the minister indicated this afternoon, that situation has now been reversed. We have had indications on various occasions that the cost of this would be something from $25 million down to $10 million. We are not sure what the cost is. We have had indications from Senator Schacht in the Senate that only 100 students might be affected yet, as the National Farmers Federation pointed out in September of last year, the statistics do not give an accurate indication of the numbers of rural people who would like to undertake further education but who are unable to because of the government's policy on asset testing. We do not actually know how many are concerned, yet the minister said again today that this is somehow going to blow a hole in the budget so far as DEET is concerned.

         If $10 million were involved, one could probably find considerable savings from within DEET itself that would cover that amount of money. If we look at the DEET budget for this year and in previous years we see that this is a department which continues to expand. This is the department of government which, when questioned in Senate estimates earlier this year, could not actually indicate where one of its divisions had gone—it had been lost. We have continual expansion in the numbers of public servants employed by that department each year.

         In the midst of the rural crises that we have around this country—floods, fires and droughts over much of the country over the past few years—this measure, which was seen by farmers and others in rural areas as beneficial, is being ripped away from them by the government. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was recently off on his latest tango in Paris, yet here is the minister saying, `There is about $10 million here which we cannot make up in some way in the department.' I suggest to the minister that $10 million worth of waste in the Department of Employment, Education and Training would not be too difficult to find.

         The history of this is that, first of all, the matter was treated secretly. It was almost a month before the minister came into this chamber and made some statement about the matter, even though the student assistant offices around the country had been indicating to students that they would no longer be able to qualify for Austudy without the assets test, even if they held the health care card. It was a month before we had any clear indication that this was what had happened.

         Then we had the excuse from the government that it was some `administrative contradiction', to quote the spokesperson for the minister at that particular time, and that therefore it was something that should simply be overlooked, even though it was quite clear that at least some families around Australia would be adversely affected. The department will admit to a minimum of 100 families being affected, although there are quite clear indications that many more families are affected by this measure. Therefore, it is something that is of real concern to many farming families.

         My office has had reports and telephone calls from families in various parts of Australia saying that this has made a clear difference to their ability to provide education for sons and daughters, particularly those wanting to obtain higher education at both higher secondary and tertiary levels. The effect of this measure is that those students who have obtained Austudy with the health care card—that is, without qualifying under the assets test—will lose that qualification after their health care card runs out. Normally, health care cards run out after a period of six months unless they are renewed. There is a situation of real injustice for those families. We have hundreds of other families across Australia who relied upon what they saw as a commitment from the government to recognise their particular difficulties being ripped away from them.

         Therefore, as I indicated to the minister at the outset of my contribution to this debate, we on this side of the House will not accede to his motion. We believe that this is a microcosm of Labor's approach to public policy generally because it illustrates one of two things. It demonstrates either inept administration, if we believe what the minister says about this—even though what he says seems quite contrary to the first response from the department—or, more likely, a reversal of a commitment that was clearly given to the Australian people. When one looks beyond the rhetoric to the government's lack of commitment to rural and regional Australia, one can see that this has been illustrated once again in this particular motion before the House.

         We had the situation last year where the same government was moving to take 16- and 17-year-olds off Austudy and put them onto family payments. The effect of that would have been a saving to Treasury overall, a reduction in the amount of Austudy that many of those kids would have received, a reduction in the weekly amounts, a reduction in the income test and a reduction in the assets test as well. I think this is just another example of the way in which rural and regional students are being treated by this particular government.

         It does not matter what the government says about its policy; it does not matter what platitudes are spouted around the country: what one has to look at is the actual policy and the actual practice to determine what its policy is. Here are two illustrations of what its actual policy is. No matter what platitudes are spouted in this place or in the bush about how it cares and is concerned for students in rural Australia, the sad fact is that for those who come from a rural part of Australia, their educational opportunities are much less than they would be in metropolitan urban areas. That is a fact documented by a series of studies, not least of which was the  1991 report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training.

         This is a government which has in other areas implemented affirmative action programs in order to raise some people and some sectors of the community so they can be treated as equal, yet here we have clearly documented evidence about the inequality in terms of educational opportunities and educational outcomes for students in the bush in Australia. The bush people regarded this measure to be to their benefit, particularly in times as harsh as at present, yet the government after six months ripped away what was regarded as a commitment to these people. The message to people in the bush from this government in relation to this particular motion is, `Forget educational opportunity. We simply are not interested in it.' If the government offers platitudes in the future and says, `We are interested and we are out to give you a fair go,' people in the bush should look back on the record, look back on this motion tonight, look back on the passage of this legislation and look back on what the government tried to do in relation to 16- and 17-year olds with Austudy. That record speaks loudly.

         —In response to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), this issue has been discussed a number of times in this chamber. I simply reiterate that the policy was quite clear in terms of the cabinet decision on this matter. The cabinet decision embraced the income test but not the assets test for health care cardholders. The honourable member for Menzies is wrong and he knows he is wrong when he perpetuates that fiction.

         Secondly, this is far from a matter of discriminating  against families or young people living in regional or rural Australia. In fact, to do what the opposition is asking would be to make a special case of that group by making the assets test inapplicable for that group only in Austudy applications. Finally, if this is such a good idea, as opposition members are now saying, I wonder why it was not included in their policy last year. If one reads Fightback, one will find no mention at all of the removal of the assets test for Austudy purposes for farming families. Indeed, if one reads Fightback one will find only a proposal to remove some 30,000 students from Austudy to save an estimated $30 million. I find it interesting that these matters are still being attended to by the former shadow minister. Apparently his successor, who certainly has had time to get across this issue, does not approach it with the same enthusiasm as the honourable member for Menzies.

         Subject to the advice of the review committee and the passage of these amendments by the parliament, I propose that a supplementary election be conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission as soon as possible after the enabling legislation is assented to. Clause 13 enables the minister to make rules for the conduct of TSRA elections by a system of wards. It should be noted that the provisions allow for maximum flexibility so that rules can be made for the conduct of elections in the Torres Strait area or in any part of the Torres Strait area by a system of wards.

         Clause 25 broadens the scope of the TSRA land and resources fund. The provision in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Act (No. 3) 1993 establishing the TSRA land and resources fund—through section 144W—stipulates that moneys in the fund may only be spent in making grants for the acquisition of land and in acquiring land. However, because the Torres Strait is essentially a marine environment, the purposes for which moneys in the fund may be spent should be broadened to include development and ongoing maintenance of real property, including improvements to such property and the development of marine resources in accordance with the marine strategy to be contained in the Torres Strait development plan.

A supplementary election is defined as a zone election held to fill a casual vacancy in the office of commissioner representing the zone or a zone election held in place of a zone election in relation to which the Federal Court of Australia has made an order under schedule 4.

         —The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1994 extends the authority of the Torres Strait Regional Authority which comes into operation this Friday, 1 July 1994. The Torres Strait Regional Authority was established under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 with the support of the coalition. The official launching of the authority will be held on Thursday Island on Friday. It will be with great pleasure that I attend this historic event. In the words of the chairman of the Torres Strait Regional Council, who will now be the chairman of the authority, the authority will empower Torres Strait Islander people to take control of their destiny and to determine the future of their children.

         Torres Strait Islanders comprise one of Australia's most isolated peoples, separated by sea from one another and separated by vast distances from the rest of Australia. They have few of the services and amenities taken for granted by most other Australians and normal opportunities for advancement are limited. Only recently a fundamental weakness of Labor's approach to Torres Strait Islanders has been its failure to recognise the unique civilisation of islanders and their need, living in a distant region of Australia, to manage their own affairs. The 1993 bill gave the Torres Strait Regional Authority authority to take over ATSIC functions.

         It is appropriate that indigenous organisations shape government policy, manage government programs and make funding decisions with regard to the communities they represent. The islanders have their own traditions and languages, they have their own legends of origin and they have a distinct cultural history. For thousands of years they were and they still are a seafaring people and the relationship between the islanders and the sea is a key one. Not only has it been the basis of their livelihood, but also it has influenced their cultural traditions, social structures and general wellbeing.

Section 144W(3) of the bill recognises that the Torres Strait is a marine environment and allows funds to be used for improvements to property and development of marine resources in accordance with the marine strategy.

The coalition is pleased that the authority will now have the power to negotiate and make agreements with other Commonwealth bodies, and state and territory government bodies.

         Last year, in a paper presented to the International Indigenous Politics and Self-Government Conference in Norway, the chairman of the Torres Strait Regional Council, Mr Getano Lui Jr, asserted that there must be a health and medical preventative and clinical service accountable to the people of the Torres Strait with provision for culturally sensitive services. He called for appropriate social services, cultural programs, education administration and public services. He said—and the coalition echoes these sentiments—that facilities generally available to all Australians and Queenslanders must be available in the Torres Strait. The government stands condemned that islanders as with other Aboriginal communities have suffered from a lack of basic services that other Australians take for granted.

         Recently the federal Race Discrimination Commissioner found that the basic human rights to clean water and good sanitation that most Australians take for granted were not enjoyed by people in remote communities. This reflects on the government which is so good on rhetoric but, when it comes down to services, does not live up to that rhetoric, and the people who suffer are those and other disadvantaged communities in Australia. It is these sorts of issues that the new authority will be addressing. The coalition is pleased that the best interests of the people of the Torres Strait will be decided by the people themselves. These amendments and the original bill affirm that the islanders are citizens of Australia and Queensland but rightly become responsible for their own destiny. The coalition supports the bill.

As has been outlined by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the main purpose of this bill is to establish the Torres Strait Regional Authority. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh said, that will  allow  the  people  of  the  Torres  Strait to determine their own future and their own affairs.

         Unfortunately the people of the Torres Strait, like other indigenous peoples of Australia, are suffering under appalling conditions, as reflected in their health statistics. They have also suffered problems with regard to their access to services that the rest of the Australian community take for granted. It goes without saying that if colonisation of Australia had not occurred the appalling health statistics we now have in the Torres Strait would not be occurring. That comes through very clearly when we talk to people from Thursday Island, Badu Island, Murray Island or any of the other islands in the Torres Strait.

         Mr Steve Mam, who is an important spokesperson for the Torres Strait community, said, `We did not have deaths in custody in the Torres Strait before colonisation occurred and European settlement came to Australia because we did not have people in custody. We did not have people who were homeless. We did not have people who were dependent on alcohol or on drugs or on tobacco, which cause some alarming health statistics. We had a sense of community and we dealt with our people with that sense of community.' It has been because of the way European civilisation has so dramatically affected the people of the Torres Strait and set about a progressive destruction of their culture that all of those problems have now emerged. It is our responsibility to restore to the people of the Torres Strait some independence so that they can once more come to their own solutions to these problems.

         The other important thing that we need to understand about the islanders of the Torres Strait is that they have maintained a much stronger link with their traditional culture and with the land than a lot of other indigenous communities in Australia have been able to achieve. It was from an island in the Torres Strait that the native title issue first emerged. It was a former resident of Murray Island who initiated the action, firstly against the Queensland government and subsequently in the High Court of Australia, to assert his and his community's rights over the land in the Torres Strait, on Murray island, the island of Mer. That needs to be understood very clearly.

         The people of the Torres Strait have maintained their traditional activity and their cultural identity with their land probably more than a lot of other indigenous communities, apart from a number of communities in the Northern Territory. If we had let them run their own affairs and be in control of their own communities from the start, then I do not think we would have had the alarming health statistics we have had put before us on a regular basis regarding the dramatic way Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal Australians are suffering. I have examples here from a paper that was delivered to the Torres Strait health workshop in April of last year, a paper called,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Our health, our future, our decision
         </emphasis>
         . It talks about mortality statistics. Life expectancy for Torres Strait Islanders is some 20 years less than it is for other Australians. The average age of death for males is 55.7 years. It declined in the years 1980 to 1989 from what it was in the years 1970 to 1979. So the mortality rates for people from the Torres Strait are worsening, not improving.

         For females in the Torres Strait the average age of death in the decade 1980 to 1989 was 48.8 years, which is almost 30 years younger than the average Australian mortality rate. Both sides of the House should be ashamed of those statistics. They have not come about because of the last five years of the Queensland Government or the last 10 years of the federal government. This situation has developed over the last 200 years of our administration of indigenous affairs in this country. It is not something that I am proud of. It is certainly something that I am committed to trying to correct. It is not something that we can score political points on. It is something that both sides, when we have been in power at state and federal level, have failed to adequately address.

         What we are doing in this legislation is saying to the Torres Strait Islanders, `We have failed. We should be giving the authority to you to see if you can do a better job than we seem to have been able to do.' It is an issue that we have regularly addressed in this House. I chair the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. In our report that was tabled last year in the parliament,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Access and equity: rhetoric or reality?
         </emphasis>
         , which was a report on our inquiry into the implementation of the access and equity strategy, we made a number of recommendations with regard to access to mainstream health, housing, employment, education and other services for indigenous Australians, and in particular for people in the Torres Strait. I quote from this report:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Access to adequate health services is a basic right but one which is denied to many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Evidence was given by ATSIC that 80 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are reliant on mainstream services, and yet the committee heard significant evidence that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people do not receive equitable access or reasonable treatment in most mainstream health services. it can therefore be concluded that this has resulted in many Aboriginal and Islander people not receiving adequate health care.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is very much evidenced by the information we have got from the Torres Strait. Last year during our hearings in the Torres Strait we were told that Torres Strait Islander communities have spent on them only 50 per cent of the amount that all Australians living on mainland Australia, in Queensland for example, have spent on them. When you take into account the fact that the islands of the Torres Strait also have severe water problems, severe housing shortages, overcrowded housing, severe employment problems, and large numbers of Torres Strait islanders with no access to mainstream employment, it is a severe indictment on the performance of successive governments in this area.

I hope that they will not be subjected to massive and corrosive questioning of every single decision and act they undertake, as unfortunately occurs too frequently in the examination of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in this country.

         Another thing that members of the House of Representatives committee have come to appreciate is that Aboriginal organisations and Torres Strait Islander organisations are subjected to probably more than twice as much accountability as any other government department or community organisation. I do not in any way reject the requirement for accountability. Every taxpayer's dollar that is being spent needs to be clearly checked and accounted for to ensure that it is consistent with government policy and the community's expectations. I stand by that, and I believe that should be the same for Aboriginal organisations as for any other organisation.

We are forcing Aboriginal organisations to spend twice as much of their money on management and supervision as we expect other organisations to expend. Therefore, we are taking those valuable dollars and the time of those Aboriginal organisations away from the actual delivery of services.

But they should not be twice or three times as accountable as any other organisation. They should be as accountable as any other organisation. I believe that the Torres Strait Regional Authority would be very happy to be as accountable as, say, the Department of Social Security or some medical organisations to which we provide millions of dollars in research funding.

Their suggestion is that Aboriginal and Islander Affairs should be fully transferred over to the Commonwealth's responsibility. I support that. I believe that that is a very reasonable objective, but that will not avoid continuing responsibility of all state governments in areas where the Commonwealth does not and could not provide services to Aboriginal and Islander people, such as in education and access to employment in the state public service. It does still mean that the Queensland government or other state governments are responsible for providing roads which Aboriginal and Islander people will want to access.

         One also has to appreciate that 70 per cent of indigenous Australians live in urban communities and that they are part of the mainstream community, as far as their access to health services, hospitals, schools and things like that are concerned. They will still require access to those mainstream services, regardless of whether they are provided by state governments, local governments or Commonwealth governments. Although I support the planning and policy determinations occurring at the Commonwealth level in principle and although I believe that the Commonwealth should fully fund community health services and other specific services that are targeted purely at remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, there can be no complete withdrawal from the services to Aboriginal and Islander Australians by state governments, even if that policy determination process is handed over to the Commonwealth. We cannot differentiate in mainstream Australia and say to an Aboriginal person, `The Commonwealth is now responsible for you. You can't go to our local state school or our local hospital.' Therefore, Aboriginal people will still be getting access to state services and local services in that respect.

The honourable member for Moreton is well known for his deep commitment to the cause of Australia's Aboriginal people and his genuine desire to see our Aboriginal Australians share more fully the wonderful opportunities that our country offers.

         I have also noted his comment on the suggestion that Aboriginal affairs should be transferred entirely to the Commonwealth. For all the reasons which the honourable member for Moreton put up, I would come to the opposite conclusion. I believe that it is appropriate that the states should continue to take a particular interest in Aboriginal affairs and develop necessary programs to ensure that Aboriginal Australians have proper health services, better education and a much better standard of living.

         Frankly, I do not think there is much evidence to suggest that Commonwealth programs have been any more successful in Aboriginal matters than state programs.

         It is beyond question that aspects of Australia's policy towards its Aboriginal people have not been successful or satisfactory and have failed not only Aborigines but, indeed, all Australians. There needs to be a genuine debate in the community about what can be done to improve the situation. There is a universal desire and agreement to achieve better results for Aborigines.

         This particular piece of legislation attempts to assist the Torres Strait Islander sector of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community in developing a better regional system. I hope it is successful in that regard. Frankly, outward organisations will not of themselves achieve too much. There has to be a genuine commitment from both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians to achieve better results, and there has been little evidence of that to date in many areas.

         This legislation deals with, amongst many other things, suggested changes to the election regulations which apply to ATSIC. I want to use this debate, therefore, to review some of the results of the 1993 ATSIC elections. Those election results and the conduct of those elections are an acute embarrassment for the Australian electoral system. At a time when we are going around the world as electoral advisers, when we are supervising elections in other countries, what happened in the 1993 ATSIC elections is a very poor example to the rest of the world. Many Third World countries would be ashamed to have an election conducted in the way our 1993 ATSIC elections were conducted, and would be ashamed at many of the allegations of irregularity and the concerns about the overall outcome of those elections.

         The 1993 ATSIC elections chose 573 regional councillors from a total of 2,001 nominations. However, only 45,820 of the estimated 147,500 eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people actually voted. There were some 480 polling places and around 400 mobile booths. A turnout of only 32.15 per cent is obviously the first point of concern. There is an immediate difficulty with all of the figures because there is no roll of who is eligible to vote at ATSIC elections. The general electoral roll is used, and then there is some arbitrary system to determine who, amongst the eight or 10 million Australians on that roll, are actually able to vote at ATSIC elections. That system of itself is open to widespread abuse and there are many concerns about who was allowed to vote at this election and who was not allowed to vote. While we have a system where there is no specific roll, those difficulties will continue to arise.

         Part of the reason why there is no roll is that there is no real definition of who is an Aboriginal. There has been some debate about what proportion of Aboriginal blood a person should have before being entitled to be called an Aborigine. Frankly, I do not think that offers an appropriate solution to whatever difficulties arise in determining Aboriginality. But neither does the current system which basically says that, if a couple of people agree that someone is an Aborigine, then he is. That particularly causes difficulty where there are hotly contested elections and where the eligibility for individual people to vote is subject to dispute. So the very identification of 147,500 people who might be eligible to vote at ATSIC elections is in the beginning a debatable figure and one which is seriously open to disputation.

         Nonetheless, the Australian Electoral Commission, the body charged with running all of the federal elections in Australia and charged with running the ATSIC elections, came to a conclusion that 147,500 people were eligible to vote in this series of ATSIC elections. As I mentioned before, only 45,820 of those people bothered to turn up to vote. The voter turnout ranged from as little as 8.5 per cent in Sydney to 106.2 per cent at Mornington. Any election that produces a 106 per cent turnout must also leave people asking a lot of questions.

         The only explanation that the Electoral Commission was able to offer in relation to that unexpectedly large turnout was that more people turned up than were expected. It is obvious that more people than expected turned up, but why did 106 per cent of the expected Mornington enrolment vote? How many people voted who should not have voted? Why was the Electoral Commission so out of touch with the number of people who should vote in an electorate like Mornington? With as little as 8.5 per cent turnout in Sydney and as much as 106 per cent turnout in another electorate, alarm bells should have been ringing immediately in the minds of those who were conducting the elections.

         Looking around the various states, the turnout in New South Wales was just 20.78 per cent; Victoria, 19.02 per cent; Queensland, 35.74 per cent; Western Australia, 40.25 per cent; South Australia, 25.66 per cent; Tasmania, 16.43 per cent; and Northern Territory, the best of the lot, perhaps not unsurprisingly, 51.19 per cent. So around Australia there was just a 32 per cent turnout. But there is worse. Of the votes of those 45,820 who bothered to turn up, 6,000 were rejected by the commission and a further 2,000 were declared informal. That leaves us with just over 33,000 formal votes in an election which was supposed to involve 147,500 Aborigines; that is around a 20 per cent formal vote. One really has to question the legitimacy of an election that produces a 20 per cent formal vote nationwide.

         When we look specifically at some of the electorates, the news is even more alarming. In the electorate of Nhulunby South in the Northern Territory, four ATSIC counsellors were elected from only 10 formal votes. There were an estimated 845 voters in that particular ward of whom 489 actually voted. However, 477 of the 489 were rejected and another two were treated as informal. Any election which produces only 10 formal votes out of an enrolment of 845 is farcical and an appalling indictment on those organising the election.

In the Roma area, which includes the western part of my electorate, there was a turnout of 44.2 per cent of the 3,400 eligible voters. I have received a number of complaints from constituents about the elections conducted in that area. Constituents of ATSIC regional wards are also constituents of federal members of parliament. I have been approached by a number of people who are concerned about the way in which the elections were conducted and, in particular, the elections in their area.

         One of the difficulties that arises is that, while there are 480 polling places, as I understand it, there is no provision for postal voting for ATSIC elections. In my own electorate many people are obliged to travel several hundred miles to their nearest ATSIC polling booth, or they have to rely on the mobile polling booths which breeze through communities, often with seemingly little notice or advice. If Aborigines who are eligible to vote are not there on the day, they miss out on that voting opportunity. Frankly that is not good enough.

         Many of the people who were eligible to vote feel disenfranchised.

There needs to be a better system to ensure that all those who are eligible to vote have that opportunity.

         There are also allegations of voting irregularities. I shall not be able to go into those in detail today because some of them are the subject of appeals to the courts, so I guess they are sub judice. Many of them are very serious allegations which go to the core of an honest and fair voting system. The many allegations of rank corruption associated with the ATSIC elections put the legitimacy of the results in question.

         Even with the poor voter turnouts, something like 10 per cent of all of the votes cast were rejected and a further 5 per cent were declared informal. In my own area, the three local regions elected a total of 54 ATSIC councillors, yet few people are satisfied with the end result. I understand that something like 10 of the election results are now under challenge in the courts. With that number in question, many may argue that the whole election should be nullified and conducted again.

         Australians should be alarmed that these elections were conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission—the same body that is charged with conducting all federal elections in Australia. The cost of the elections was something over $4 million, or more than $100 for every vote received. Many of the allegations of voting irregularities are directed towards Electoral Commission staff. There are suggestions that many of the staff gave incorrect information to those wishing to vote and that that is the reason why many of the election votes were rejected. When false information is given in some electorates to voters about how to cast their votes, one wonders what happens in other places where there are fewer challenges and less obvious concerns.

         Irregularities seem to have been widespread, so much so that the Electoral Commission is actually lodging some of these challenges in the courts. The AEC was given $4 million to conduct the elections but it is incurring further expense by filing petitions in the Federal Court challenging election outcomes which appear to have resulted from its own mistakes. ATSIC shares many of these concerns about the conduct of the poll, the discrepancies, the poor training and briefing of staff on election day, and the general poor standard of conduct of the election.

         One other matter of concern is the extraordinary time taken to count the votes. Even though fewer than 46,000 votes were cast around Australia, it took six weeks to count the votes in most electorates. It took 41 days to count just 66 votes in Deniliquin in New South Wales; that is not a distant, remote area, it is an urban town. It took 48 days to count 91 votes at Coober Pedy. The figures in other places are similar. Many weeks were taken even in the capital cities to count the votes once they had been cast. All of this gives rise to suspicion about the nature and the validity of the ATSIC election processes.

         This bill makes some amendments to ATSIC's electoral laws, but it will not do anything to resolve the sorts of issues that have caused widespread concern in the Aboriginal community arising out of the 1993 elections. We have had observers in South Africa and in Cambodia during elections, allegedly giving advice about the way in which fair and free elections can be conducted. Our own ATSIC elections have been a very poor example and advertisement for our electoral processes. There needs to be a thorough reform of the way in which ATSIC regional councillors are elected, of the electoral processes involved, and of the system we use to determine who is eligible to vote in particular wards, who is eligible to vote in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elections per se, and the way in which people are chosen to represent Aboriginals in their various regional and national bodies.

         The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) should act to restore some credibility to ATSIC as a group by giving serious consideration to ordering a new poll for new elections to ensure that those who are representing the Aboriginal people are seen to be doing so on the basis of free and fair elections. Much needs to be done to reform this system. This legislation only tinkers at the edges and fails to address those significant issues. Frankly, if ATSIC is to have any credibility, it has to have the confidence not only of the broad Australian community but particularly of the Aboriginal population itself. The Aboriginals who talked to me about the results of this recent poll have anything but confidence in the way these elections were conducted.

Today we have not seen that sort of support. It is very unfortunate that someone would be foolish enough to act this way in this debate.

Yesterday at the Queensland state conference of the Australian Labor Party I took the opportunity to speak to the Premier about his comments on transferring a lot of areas relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to the federal area. He is very cooperative and very responsive to the needs of these people. There have been massive changes under his government. He is certainly aware of the comments made by the honourable member for Moreton regarding the need to maintain the mainstream services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

         —The year 6 and 7 class of the Cowell area school in my electorate recently held a mock election campaign. The campaign illustrated that politics is alive and well in our schools and students are concerned about the future of their country. The campaign also demonstrated the students' depth of knowledge of the problems which our nation faces and gives a timely reminder of what our priorities should be. At this juncture, I should acknowledge their teachers and the wonderful support that they gave these students. The first campaign speech I will read is from Megan Story. She said:

         —Mr Speaker, 20 July this year marks the 20th anniversary of the invasion of the Republic of Cyprus. Cyprus is a member of the Commonwealth, as is Australia. This invasion, illegal and condemned, is still extant. As honourable members will be aware, the island of Cyprus has a mixed Greek Orthodox and Turkish Moslem population. The modern legal basis for the constitutional arrangements on the island of Cyprus is the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. This treaty was one of many that followed the First World War and dealt with the problems left over by the collapse of four empires after 1918.

         By this treaty, Cyprus was recognised as having been annexed by Britain. Both Greece and Turkey signed the treaty. Turkey also renounced any rights or claims on the island of Cyprus. However, this legal basis has been ignored by Turkey, which has resorted to illegal violence against Cyprus. Not only has the Treaty of Lausanne been broken, but the UN General Assembly has been ignored.

         Since the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 and the forcible division of the island by Turkish troops, the United Nations has adopted more than 50 resolutions and decisions regarding the Cyprus problem. These resolutions relate to the central issues of the Cyprus question such as the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island; the return of citizens to their homes and properties; a proper accounting for the fate of the 1,619 Greek Cypriots, as yet, unaccounted for; the implementation of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of movement, freedom of settlement and the return of property; and, finally, the re-establishment of the security, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus.

         It is high time that these issues were addressed by Turkey in a serious and constructive way. Australia can help this process by, at the very least, seriously raising, with the Turkish authorities, the question of property return for Australian citizens in Cyprus who have been robbed by the Turkish army. Until now, Turkey has refused to cooperate with the United Nations resolution on Cyprus and still, 20 years later, has an army of occupation on Cyprus.

I will not delay the House with tales of priests crucified on the doors of their churches or farmers burned to death in their own homes. All wars are appalling in their brutality. But this war is still going on. The aggressor still commits international crimes against the innocent Greeks of Cyprus. Not only does Turkey refuse to cooperate in the humanitarian efforts required to account for the 1,619 missing Greeks, but by bringing onto the island 80,000 settlers from Turkey, protected by 35,000 Turkish soldiers, a policy of ethnic cleansing has been introduced, by Turkey, into Cyprus.

         In an era when the Berlin Wall has collapsed, the continued division of Cyprus is an affront to all sense of decency. Of course, prior to 1974 the Turkish minority in Cyprus had grievances. However, grievances are alleviated by politics, not by mass murder, theft and military occupation. Would anyone say that the situation for the Turkish minority on the island of Cyprus is now better than it was in the years before 1974? Of course, it is not. So what is to be done?

From my verandah they dominate the view and I have always admired the Bunyas as one of the especially beautiful parts of Australia.

         The Bunya Mountains National Park covers more than 11,700 hectares and is perched on the top of the Great Dividing Range, reaching an elevation of over 1,100 metres at Mount Mowbullan and Mount Kiangarow. The national park is divided between three local authority areas and three federal electorates. I share the area with the members for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and Fisher (Mr Slipper).

         About every two or three years the bunya pines produce giant pods of nuts about the size of a football which when ripe fall to the ground. In early days, Aborigines travelled hundreds of miles to meet and feast on the bunya nuts and perform corroborees. It is reported that tribal warfare and disputation would even cease during the bunya festival, though the Aborigines thought the area was haunted by evil spirits and so travelled down the mountains in the evening to sleep.

         In the 1870s, loggers began felling the giant bunya pines, red cedar and the other timber on the mountains. A huge timber industry was established. In 1908, the Queensland government set the Bunya Mountains aside as a national park. It is the second oldest national park in the state. A large state forest provides a buffer zone around the park.

Over more recent decades, national park rangers have done a wonderful job in caring for the area and upgrading visitor facilities. A large team of volunteers and several local organisations which support the work of the park staff conduct visitor programs and encourage and work on the conservation of the area.

         However, local residents are angry that the federal and state governments may be about to nominate the Bunya Mountains areas for the World Heritage List. Two well attended public meetings, one at Bell, on the western side of the park, and the other at Kumbia, on the eastern side, voted overwhelmingly—220 votes to four—to oppose World Heritage listing.

         All three local authorities in the region and the South Burnett Local Authorities Association, along with a wide range of farming and community groups, have also indicated their opposition to placing the region on the World Heritage List. These people know and love the area and have a deep commitment to its protection and maintenance. They have been prepared to devote their own time, efforts and money to care for the region in the past and they want the current system of management and care to continue. They have looked with horror at what has happened in some of the other World Heritage areas, such as the Willandra Lakes, North Queensland wet tropics and Fraser Island, and they do not want that kind of interference, bungling and heavy-handed bureaucracy imposed on their communities.

         There is concern that the rich agricultural lands which surround the park will have farming practices regulated by remote academics who have little or no appreciation of farm life and the hopes and aspirations of the community. There is an urgent need to improve access and provide better services and facilities on or near the Bunya Mountains. However, World Heritage listing will produce no new infrastructure funding and no better care for the national park; it will just produce a tangled web of complicated and restrictive management plans. At this stage, neither the federal nor the state governments have made any announcement that they intend to nominate the area.

        They are fine words. But how ironic it is that, in the year the coalition has identified law and order as a major issue, the state with the longest serving coalition government—New South Wales—has revealed how incapable it is of managing law and order.

We have seen a police minister shuffled onto the back bench, and a former police minister who was sacked because he misled parliament brought back into the ministry. Let us not forget why Mr Pickering was sacked. He resigned because he misled parliament following a row with Police Commissioner Tony Lauer about the attempted police cell suicide of Victorian teenager Angus Rigg.

The shame of it all is that the coalition at state and federal level claims it is concerned about law and order.

         It would seem that Senator Evans's lack of sensitivity is only matched by his lack of activity in this particular matter. In fact, it is all too reminiscent of another case I have introduced into this place on several occasions; namely, the abduction of the Gillespie children from Australia to Malaysia in 1992. In both cases, Senator Evans appears notable by his lack of strength or ability to defend Australian citizens against the governments of foreign countries, yet at the same time he is quite happy to receive accolades for his diplomatic skills on the world scene.

         —I must say that I find it amazing that someone would blame Senator Gareth Evans for the tragedy which has occurred on the kidnapping of the young Australian and two Britons in Cambodia. Obviously the solution in the mind of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), is that we should send the good senator off armed with a rifle and a hand grenade to traipse off into the jungles and by force of arms rescue the young lady and the two gentlemen. If that is not the resolution the honourable gentleman has, he should tell us in this House what he thinks the senator should do. If he does not have that sort of solution, then really it is just a waste of time of the House. The reality seems to be that it is just another little stir late at night on the adjournment debate.

         I speak concerning the Australian Football League and its current management. Mr Oakley is a member of the class of 1972, that famous class of people who gained their MBAs at Melbourne University, which class includes Mr Elliott and Mr Jarrett among others. Mr Oakley has brought to Australian rules football the same sorts of management practices. The AFL management today no longer has regard for those people who own the game. The people who own the game are families: families and children who go to the footy on a Saturday, buy a pie and sauce or a hot dog or whatever and dad would have a tinnie. They used to be able to stand in the outer and they used to be able to afford to go and watch their favourite team playing.

         Of course, these days those at the Australian rules football are the elite. At most of the major grounds now there are glassed in, air-conditioned banquet rooms with white tablecloths and silver service. Those who are privileged, those who have taken over the game, sit back before the match starts in air-conditioned comfort, with good wines and three-course meals. The weather does not bother them, of course. The view is uninterrupted: they have angled plate glass in front of them with a wonderful view of the ground. Of course, they do not pay for their meal. They are invited guests of the club. It is mum and dad downstairs in the rain in the outer who are paying for the privilege of these free loaders on the system and every AFL club seems to do it.

         The reality seems to me to be that the ordinary people, the Victorians, the South Australians, the Queenslanders, the New South Welshmen, all of those people who go through the turnstile and pay an increasing fee—indeed, it is getting to the stage in Victoria that families can no longer afford to take their families to the football—are being squeezed harder and harder to pay for the elite.

         It has been alleged that Mr Oakley is on a salary package in excess of $400,000 a year. It is also alleged that the AFL pays for Ron Barassi to coach Sydney, and it said that he is earning in excess of $300,000 a year. We all know that, for a variety of reasons—and I am not being critical—Sydney is a financial disaster as a football team. In Sydney there is a different participation rate of viewing from other states. It is obvious that Sydney is never going to survive as a financially viable club in New South Wales.

         It is going to get to the stage where clubs like Port Adelaide will be denied admission to the AFL because the economic rationalism driving the AFL—the Oakley view of the world—is that it will try to get a composite side up because it means profit. The game that people love, the game that families want to go and see, is being lost because of those who see it as profit only, who see the game as a means of giving them big incomes and privilege behind plate glass windows with white tablecloths and silver service. Ordinary Australian families are the losers.

         The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has once again rejected submissions to list Orap in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits on the ground that it does not offer any significant therapeutic advantage over currently-listed less expensive major tranquillisers. The Committee concedes, however, that some patients may benefit from Orap and also acknowledges the claim that Orap is better than other drugs.

        (1) This part of the honourable member's question has transposed the scheduled rate increases for leaded and unleaded petrol. The Budget measure scheduled increases in the excise rate on leaded petrol of 7 cents per litre by August 1994, whilst the rate on unleaded petrol was scheduled to increase by 5 cents per litre.

        In responding to this question, I draw the attention of the House to the Government's decision to contain the excise rate increase for fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene to just the 3 cents per litre which took effect on the night of the 1993-94 Budget and the further decrease by 1.977 cents per litre in this year's Budget, rather than the 5 cents per litre announced in the 1993-94 Budget and mentioned in (1)(d) of the honourable member's question.

        The collections data in 1992-93 and earlier years did not differentiate between leaded and unleaded petrol, as there has not previously been any difference in excise treatment of the two products. The amount collected from diesel is a gross figure which does not reflect the rebates paid under the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme (DFRS) to eligible primary production, mining and other activities (such as nursing homes and residential use).

        (3) The Government has undertaken an analysis of the impact on various industry sectors of the total package of indirect tax measures announced in the 1993-94 Budget. The measures analysed include the package of proposed changes to the excise and sales tax systems announced in the 1993-94 Budget, but do not reflect later changes to the Budget measures (other than the increase in the low income rebate to $150). The results of this analysis were tabled in the Senate on 7 September 1993. However, the analysis was not undertaken separately for each individual Budget measure, such as the excise rate increase for each petroleum product. There would be no value in undertaking such a partial analysis on each individual measure. For example, it is not possible to present results according to the different impacts on industry costs of changes to excise on leaded petrol and unleaded petrol, as there is no basis on which to determine the use of leaded versus unleaded petrol in each industry.

        (4) Petroleum product excise is collected from petroleum distributors well before the products are sold to final consumers, whether they be a householder or a commercial user. Therefore, the revenue data for petroleum excise do not provide information about the excise payments actually made by various industry sectors in 1992-93. Nor is it possible to estimate such payments on the disaggregated basis requested, for the reasons given in the answer to (3).

These are: tax compensation following full or partial privatisation of State Trading Enterprises (STEs); compensation to the States for loss of dividends and tax equivalent payments (due to loss of monopoly rents) as a result of exposing their STEs to competition; and case-by-case assistance to encourage States to implement specific reforms.

       The issue of compensation to the States for loss of dividends and tax equivalent payments has been raised in the context of implementation of the Hilmer Report on National Competition Policy. At the 25 February Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting, the Commonwealth advised that, in the context of agreement to the Hilmer competition policy principles, it would consider assistance to the States and Territories for loss of monopoly rents and the process for managing adjustment.

       the Commonwealth set aside $100 million for the upgrading of interstate electricity transmission links in return for the States committing to satisfactory grid arrangements. While no firm projects have emerged warranting investment of this amount, the Commonwealth remains committed to provide funds for further upgrading of grid interconnections where there is economic justification. Some funds have been allocated to a feasibility study of a high voltage transmission link between NSW and Queensland.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The Commonwealth also provided the largest share of funding for the National Rail Corporation (NR), as part of a reform package for the loss making interstate rail business which had imposed a continuing drain on State rail authorities. In addition, the One Nation statement earmarked $454 million for rail infrastructure, from which State Governments as well as NR will benefit, on the proviso that NR negotiate a satisfactory enterprise agreement with the unions. NR's ground breaking agreement is expected to yield cost reductions of more than 35 per cent.

        In recent years the Government's economic policy has included the objective of integrating the Australian market with the global economy and exposing local industries to international and domestic competitive pressures. The liberalisation of Australia's foreign investment policy has been part of the deregulatory and market reform initiatives. While foreign investment in Australia has increased, equity investment by Australians in overseas countries has increased at a faster rate over the past decade.

        An important part of the Government's foreign investment policy of welcoming direct foreign investment that is consistent with the needs of the Australian community is a screening process. Restrictions are applied in a few areas (for example developed residential real estate) where the Government considers that the net benefits to the Australian community are smaller. In the majority of industry sectors, however, smaller proposals are exempt and larger proposals are approved unless judged contrary to the national interest.

        Australia has traditionally been reliant on overseas savings—be they in the form of debt or equity—which is a reflection of our national investment needs exceeding our national savings. In other words, this has enabled national investment to have been higher than it otherwise would be. This is clearly beneficial for the Australian economy, providing the build-up in our net external liabilities (that is, external debt and equity) and the servicing costs thereon do not become excessive. In that regard, there is a greater reason to be concerned about increased external indebtedness—rather than equity inflow—because servicing debt involves a fixed contractual obligation, whereas equity financing is serviced only if the investment is profitable. Also the accumulation of external debt makes the Australian economy more vulnerable to external shocks and abrupt shifts in investor confidence.

        In these circumstances, it would clearly be counter productive to try and curtail equity investments in Australia—particularly direct investment. Indeed, it would generally be preferable if foreign equity investment increased relative to borrowings from abroad. This makes the objective of stabilising foreign debt as a proportion of GDP less difficult to achieve than otherwise.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">

        The Government policy does, however, aim to reduce our reliance on foreign savings by adopting policies that increase domestic savings and it is in that regard that the medium term budget deficit reduction strategy is important, as is the Superannuation Guarantee. The adoption of policies which make the Australian economy more competitive and productive will also help.

        The Government is committed to reducing the level of unemployment. The Government's White Paper on Employment, released by the Prime Minister on 4 May, reaffirms and strengthens this commitment. The package contains a commitment of more than $10.3 billion over four years to tackling unemployment.

        I am advised that my Department has not formally reviewed the effectiveness of the whistleblower legislation currently before the Queensland and New South Wales Parliaments, although it continues to monitor legislative developments relating to whistleblowing in all Australian jurisdictions. The Government has been examining proposals for legislation to protect whistleblowers as part of its consideration of recommendations made by the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law (conducted by the Gibbs Committee) on the disclosure of official information. The question of introducing such legislation is also being examined by the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, which is due to report by 30 June 1994 but which may be delayed into August due to the illness of Senator Newman.

        When the RAS was introduced in January 1993, it was intended that it should act in concert with the commercial financial system and target assistance to long term viable farmers suffering from short term difficulties. The Government wished to encourage commercial lending institutions to work in close co-operation with the State RAS authorities and to share the responsibility of assessing a farmer's prospects of long term viability. It was considered that, during periods of exceptional circumstances, backing by a commercial lending institution would be an appropriate indicator of longer term viability.

        (2) Farmers whose financial arrangements consist of inter or intra-family loans are generally precluded from receiving assistance under the exceptional circumstances guidelines. Arms-length vendor arrangements, however, may be treated in the same manner as commercial loans, providing the loan interest is set at a commercial rate.

        There is little evidence to suggest that legally binding intra-family loans, or vendor loans that are at arms length, are a significant element of overall rural debt. Data from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics indicates that in 1992-93 private debt made up less than 10 per cent of average farm debt in broadacre agriculture.

        (2) The Casemix Development Program's Strategic Plan for 1993-94—1997-98, developed by the Casemix Implementation Project Board, and endorsed by the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council late last year, focuses on three primary goals for the Program in the areas of classification development, costing/pricing and finally payments.

        In the latter area, three of the projects listed above are specifically directed at the goal of developing strategies for hospital output based funding, that is: the DVA simulation project; the University of New South Wales Casemix Classification and Payment Formulas project and the Queensland Health Department project for the Development of a Casemix Based Funding Model for Queensland Public Hospitals.

        In addition, most of the other projects under the Strategic Plan can be categorised as having the aim of building the information base to support output based funding of hospitals. However, the introduction of any case payments system remains a matter for decision by each individual State and Territory Government.

        Yes. The Bureau of Meteorology's tendering and evaluation procedures comply with the Commonwealth Government Purchasing Guidelines and follow established administrative practice. Following a complaint by an unsuccessful tenderer for flood warning equipment, these procedures were the subject of recent independent scrutiny by both the Commonwealth's major purchasing authority, Purchasing Australia, and the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Office and found to be in order.

        (8) The normal practice in reviewing matters drawn to the Minister's attention about Departmental activities is, in the first instance, to refer the matter to the area of the Department concerned. In this case, on receipt of the initial complaints the tender process was reviewed by senior Bureau staff and found to be compliant with the Commonwealth Government Purchasing Guidelines. Subsequently, the procedures have also been reviewed independently by the Commonwealth's major purchasing authority, Purchasing Australia (part of the Department of Administrative Services) and the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Both provided assurances that the procedures were compliant with the Guidelines.

        (a) Proscar is indicated for the treatment and control of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients who are not candidates for immediate surgery. It is suggested that it reduces the size of testosterone dependent tissues in benign prostatic enlargement.

        Clinical studies indicate that finasteride results in a 14-20% reduction in prostate volume after 48 weeks of treatment in 50% of patients. This is compared to 20% of patients on a placebo.

        The PBAC is of the view that the clinical place and value of finasteride in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia remain unclear. The Committee considers that efficacy is modest and the real clinical benefit represented by small improvement in some measures (e.g. increase in urine flow) is difficult to assess. Furthermore, the cost to achieve these modest improvements is not favourable.

        (3) Several clinical trials of Proscar have been initiated in Australia. The sponsoring company has advised that the results of some of these trials were included in the efficacy and safety data that was independently evaluated before the drug was approved for registration in Australia. The main studies in the application were from America.
