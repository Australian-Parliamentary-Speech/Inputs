The government believes Australia's compulsory superannuation system must be transparent, accountable and well regulated, prioritising outcomes for members, not shareholders, directors or employees, or trade unions. I'm confident the measures in this bill will achieve these outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Super is an important financial assetâfor most Australian households, their largest financial asset and their second-biggest asset after the family home. That's why we need to make sure we've got the foundations right. The powers of the regulators and the obligations of trustees and directors must measure up to contemporary standards. That's why the measures in the bill are essential and why they need to be passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the measures in the bill have been on the policy agenda for several years and have been recommended by past reviews into super, including most recently by the Productivity Commission, which labelled them a policy must-have. The bill contains new measures to modernise the super system and reintroduces the portfolio handling disclosure measures. It implements two of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry relating to super. It will improve the quality of super products by introducing a new requirement for trustees to consider the appropriateness of their MySuper and choice products via a new outcome assessment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill strengthens the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's powers in a number of key areas. The enhanced directions power will ensure that the regulator has the ability to quickly intervene to protect the interests of members, including by directing trustees to take specific actions, such as transferring, merging or winding up a fund. The bill also strengthens the powers of the regulator by requiring approval to be obtained before a change in ownership or control of a trustee takes place by introducing civil and criminal penalties for trustees and directors who break their obligations and by enhancing the authorisation process for MySuper products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government expects the regulator to use these powers to safeguard the interests of members, including to more effectively address fund underperformance. Finally, it will improve transparency by introducing a requirement for trustees to hold annual members' meetings by enabling the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority to obtain more detailed data on super fund expenses and by introducing workable arrangements for portfolio holding disclosures. The performance of the super system has a direct bearing on the retirement incomes of each and every Australian. Confidence in the system is obtained by ensuring members can see where their funds are being invested and see super trustees who are complying with the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important to recognise that, in passing this bill, we are legislating two recommendations of the royal commission. This is within nine weeks of the government receiving the final report. It's only this government, frankly, that can be trusted to take action on all 76 recommendations, and the passing of this bill is yet another example of the government continuing to reform the financial sector in a way that delivers better outcomes for members of superannuation funds. It's only this government that is putting members' interests first and it's focusing on ensuring Australia's super system delivers outcomes for all Australians first and foremost, not for any self-interest in the industryâthat is, a system that encourages people to participate actively; that ensures transparency to facilitate informed decisions; that gives people the confidence to invest; that is a strong regulator; and that is equipped to protect members' interests and, when required, to hold funds to account. I'm confident the measures in the bill will achieve these outcomes. Full details of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="140590" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'NEIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:37</span>):  It's a great pleasure to speak on behalf of Labor members in parliament about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2019. It's a bit of a dry name for the bill, but it's a bill that does something that's actually incredibly important and which is going to make big improvements to the superannuation savings of Australians. I'm particularly pleased to speak on this bill because Labor was able to take the opportunity in the other place to make enormous improvements to this bill. The bill as it was originally drafted was actually going to leave very large segments of the Australian superannuation market out of these additional accountability measures. Labor has been pleased to fix that problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I get into the content of the bill, though, I need to respond to a little bit of the rhetoric that was coming at us from the minister on the other side of the House. To now hear the government saying that they're the ones that can be trusted to implement the royal commission recommendations is laughable. That is laughable. It was April Fools' Day on Monday. It's Thursday today, and we can't take jokes like that in the House of Representatives. The idea that this government has any moral authority over financial services reform in this country is a complete and utter joke. They did everything they could to avoid calling a royal commission into the big banks. They did everything they could to protect them from proper laws and proper accountability. Indeed, while Labor spent almost two years arguing for that royal commission, the government put its political capital into trying to give $17 billion to the big banks, who we now know were anything but deserving of a big tax cut. So to have the minister come into the chamber and say that they can be trusted on bankingâcome on, that's just ridiculous!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just up to the point of the royal commission but in the response to the royal commission that we see the government doing everything they can, using weasel words and clever political language to try to get out of implementing the recommendations. In fact they're using this in what they probably think is a clever way, saying that they're going to take action on the 76 recommendations of the royal commission. The reason they're using that language is they're not going to implement them; they're just going to do something, a little bit, about some of those problems. In large part, the government have said that they'll think about the things that Commissioner Hayne recommended laterâthey'll do a review in a few years; they might go one-tenth of the way towards doing what Commissioner Hayne recommended. I'm so disappointed to hear the minister come in here and put forward the very false premise that the government has any authority to talk about these issues in that way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House is a very good example. In fact, it's the second day in a row in this parliament where I've got up on a bill where Labor has been behind pushing the government further to make those laws good laws and where it's Labor that's been behind bringing the royal commission recommendations into those laws, which the government's been saying that it can't implement. The minister's right: we've had nine weeks since the royal commission reported. If the parliament had actually been sitting during that time, we could have made real headway on putting some of those recommendations into law. But, instead, here we are with the government flapping around. It doesn't want the parliament to sit because it knows it has to have terrible things called 'Liberal Party caucus meetings' where all they do is yell at each other rather than address the problems facing the country. It's a bit of a joke, but I don't think I really need to point that out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to the subject of the discussion today, which is about the member outcomes test, I mentioned that the original bill didn't actually do what we thought it needed to do, which is apply more accountability to a broad range of superannuation funds and accounts that Australians are in. The major feature of this bill is the member outcomes test, which would require trustees to assess on an annual basis whether the outcomes that have been delivered by their products are promoting the financial interests of the members. It's a pretty straightforward thing. In fact, I think it's interesting that we weren't already doing it. It's a significant reform, and it's one that Labor in principle would always have supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were very significant issues, though, with the way that this bill was originally drafted. The biggest issue was that it applied only to MySuper products. Superannuation's quite complicated, but anyone who is paying even a little bit of attention knows that the biggest issues in superannuation are actually not in MySuper; they are choice products. Here we had the government putting forward a bill that would have taken what is the best-performing part of this sector and introduced more accountability to that part, but the really troubling aspect of the sector was going to be left untouched. It's unfortunately a pretty regular narrative that we see when the government comes in and tries to make changes to superannuation. The changes, as the government had drafted them, would have largely exempted about 83 per cent of the bank-owned and other retail superannuation assets, and that is despite the fact that choice products are consistently delivering poorer returns to members than MySuper products. I should make it really clear that that's not to say that there are no issues with MySuper productsâthere are. But to leave the choice products out of the outcomes test was not going to fly with the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are the architects of Australia's compulsory superannuation system, and that's why we'll always fight for stronger laws to strengthen, improve and protect this sector. There's a lot of really good debate about how we should be regulating financial services and, particularly, how much we should allow consumers to make their own decisions and, in some cases, their own mistakes. Superannuation has a number of very distinctive features which mean the parliament has to play a greater role in making sure that Australians are protected. For one thing, it's compulsory. This parliament actually legislates to force people to put aside part of their income each year for their retirement. So we're requiring people to save. We also know that people tend not to pay a great deal of attention to their superannuation. You only have to look at the number of Australians who have multiple superannuation accounts, up until even their forties and fifties, to see that people are not taking such an active interest in their super until those final years before they get into retirement. The other thing is that it's actually just very complicated. So, for those three reasons, it's really important that the parliament comes in, makes really good laws and makes sure that Australians are properly protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What came out of the Hayne royal commission sickened me and it sickened Labor members of parliament. It was just devastating to see the way that financial services firms and superannuation firms, in some instances, really abuse the trust that Australians put in them. It was a royal commission, as I said, that the government voted against 26 timesâa royal commission that they never wanted to happenâand it's very clear that they don't actually want to implement the recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were also very concerned about the findings that the Productivity Commission inquiry into superannuation made earlier this year. That really told us, for the first time, what the impact is of an Australian falling into a superannuation fund that does not perform very well. The Productivity Commission showed us that, if someone comes into a fund at the top quartileâone of the highest-performing funds in Australiaâat the beginning of their career, they are going to be somewhere in the order of $500,000 better off in their retirement than they would be if they'd been defaulted into a poor-performing fund. What is so outrageous is that, for a lot of people, whether they end up in a high-performing fund or a low-performing fund at the beginning of their career, it just comes down to luck. So right now this parliament has a compulsory savings scheme that allows people, really through a lottery, to end up in a high- or low-performing fund, and the impact on that person could be a difference of half a million dollars when they retireâa very significant impact on the standard of living of a retiree. So it's absolutely clear that the parliament needs to take significant action on this question, and the member outcomes test is part of helping us do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has one primary priority for superannuation, and that is protecting members' interests. What that means is that we need to get as many Australians into high-performing superannuation funds as we can. Labor's amendments to this bill in the Senate will force choice superannuation funds to report on their performance for the first time, like MySuper products. They go beyond what was in the government's initial bill and beyond the government's amendments. We were very pleased to see them get crossbench support in the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, as amended, will shine a light on underperformance and ensure that we have tough benchmarking of high and low performance. We don't want to let underperformers continue to be left alone in the dark with our money, as we saw in the royal commission. Labor's amendments successfully passed the Senate. They will also allow us to crack down on dodgy directors of super funds and trustees by significantly increasing penalties for misconduct to more than $500,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also moved amendments to schedule 5 to strengthen APRA's directions power so that it can extend it to related parties. Many superannuation fund trustees delegate the operation of the fund to related parties. That's why that was such an important measure. If the directions power did not apply to related parties, APRA would need to rely on contractual rightsâwhich, in some instances, wouldn't have even existedâto ensure that actions that the related party needs to take, in APRA's view, would be done. Those amendments are important additions to APRA's powers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest problem facing Australian superannuation today is poor-performing funds and the many millions who are defaulted into them each year or who are stuck in them. If elected, Labor will act to address this issue. We can't stand by while millions of Australians have their savings eaten up by poor performance or fee-gouging. Labor is proud to have strengthened this bill to crack down on these funds and hopefully ensure a better retirement for the many Australians stuck in them. There are big issues in our superannuation system. The government has had almost six years to address them but has failed to take action. There is unpaid superannuation, which the best evidence we have tells us is actually a bigger problem in this country than wage theft. There is the superannuation gender gap. Australian women are retiring with roughly half as much in their retirement accounts as men. We just can't continue like that. There are chronic underperforming funds and dodgy funds that are misusing workers' money and ripping off people in retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to make sure that superannuation is working better for all Australians. And that's why, if elected, Labor will introduce a raft of measures that will work towards closing the superannuation gender pay gap. This includes paying superannuation for the first time on Commonwealth paid parental leave and dad and partner payments, because it's just wrong that someone who takes time out of work to look after children essentially pays this enormous financial penalty later in their life for doing so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also has a plan to address the enormous issue of unpaid superannuation. That includes placing the right to superannuation within the National Employment Standards, strengthening the ATO compliance regime and increasing penalties for employers for underpayment or non-payment of superannuation. And Labor will take significant steps to lift the performance of funds. Standing up for ordinary people is the core mission of our political party. We're very proud to have created superannuation with our friends in the union movement. And we're very proud of what it's come to todayâalmost $3 trillion in savings, which provides huge economic benefits to us more broadly and, most importantly, provides a more comfortable retirement for millions of Australians. But this system relies on public trust, and we need to do a bit of work, I think, to restore that public trust so that we can make sure that millions more people benefit from it in the future. Thank you.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:49</span>):  I rise to speak in support of this bill. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2019 includes eight changes to superannuation governance arrangements, including transparency measures, new powers for APRA to regulate superannuation licensees, and new penalties for directors. As the shadow minister has just outlined, Labor was successful in moving some amendments to this bill in the Senate which improve the operation of the bill and, most importantly, extend its coverage. Those amendments were drafted by the shadow ministerâimportantly, in consultation with the industry. We listened to the feedback that we'd got from people who work within this industry about the shortcomings of this bill and we moved to rectify those. In doing so, we've been able to improve the coverage of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the government's amendments requiring registrable superannuation entity licensees to look through pooled superannuation trusts to meet their obligations to make information about their portfolio holdings publicly available, that's a reform that Labor certainly supports and that will improve transparency and governance of super funds, and clarifying that the obligations on RSE licensees apply equally in respect of all choice products and MySuper products is of course something that Labor supports and wants included in this reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues that Labor has been concerned about predominantly relate to ensuring that choice products that contain multiple investment options are required to disclose portfolio holdings. This is because the disclosure requirements only extended to investment options held or issued by the RSE or related entities, so retail funds which offer their investment options via custodial arrangements may not have met the requirements. Labor, in consultation with the industry, raised these concerns that the changes didn't apply to choice products and were largely exempting around 83 per cent of bank-owned and other retail superannuation assets, and Labor's amendments have ensured that the annual MySuper outcomes assessment gives priority to net return to members, that provisions of the bill cover choice products as well as MySuper products, that APRA is given the same powers in granting and cancelling an RSE licence as it will have for MySuper authority, that APRA's direction powers extend to connected entities, and that it's clear in the bill that the portfolio holdings disclosure requirements cover choice products with multiple investment options.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the government's original amendments basically implied that bad member outcomes were confined to MySuper products. We all know that's not the case. Regular surveys and assessments of the performance of funds across the industry, retail and self-managed sectors indicate that some of the best-performing funds, in terms of not only the investment outcomes for members but also the transparency associated with fees and charges, are delivered by industry funds, and many of those are MySuper products. Our amendments force choice superannuation funds to report their performance, like those MySuper products do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know, unfortunately, that millions of Australians are being ripped off by underperforming accounts. It's critical that they are forced to report their performance and lift their game. We've seen, not only through the banking royal commission but also through the recent Productivity Commission report, just what a difference an underperforming account can make to a member's balance when they retire. The shadow minister pointed out earlier that, if someone, through no fault of their own, is defaulted into a badly performing fund, as compared to a high-performing fund, the difference at the end of their working life can literally be close to millions of dollars. When most people enter into the superannuation regime, they're defaulted into a particular product, becauseâlet's face itâthey're not aware of how the superannuation system operates. When you're talking about teenagers and people in their early 20s, they don't have the financial literacy to understand how the system works, and a lot of the time they start in a particular occupation and are defaulted into a particular fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to ensure, when that does occur, that those that are in that situation can have trust in the operation of that fundâthat the trustees are operating in the best interests of their members and ultimately trying to maximise the performance of the fund. Labor's technical amendments will significantly strengthen that outcomes test. We need to see penalties for dodgy directors increased to more than $500,000 to make the penalties effective but also to ensure that they're retrospective to October 2015. Labor will also seek to strengthen APRA's directions power and increase super funds' portfolio-holding obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that Labor built the superannuation systemâit's something that we're very, very proud ofâand we're always working and consulting with the industry to improve it. Where sensible amendments are offered by the government we will seek to support them, but in this case we've also been able to improve the regime and the amendments that have been put forward by the government. The financial services royal commission demonstrated that there needs to be much more scrutiny, much more accountability and much more transparency when it comes to the provision of financial services in this country. That not only applies to the advice industry, it not only applies to the insurance industry or the banking industryâparticularly in areas associated with mortgages and loansâbut it also applies to superannuation. Progress in improving transparency, accountability and better outcomes, including in superannuation, is something that Labor wholeheartedly supports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are serious issues in superannuation that still need to be dealt with. The government have had six years to try and deal with some of those issues and they've abjectly failed. The notion that people can have unpaid superannuation in this day and age is simply criminal and it amounts to wages theft. Given the technical nature of payments platforms for people and the fact that everyone in the workforce has a tax file number, we should be able to make sure that, if someone is working in a particular industry, in a particular occupation, they are paid superannuation in accordance with the legislation and on time, yet it's not the case. It's something that this government have been woefully inadequate in dealing with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The superannuation gender pay gap is a serious issue that still results in a major disadvantage, predominantly for women in Australia, as a result of them taking breaks from the workforce. It's an issue on which Labor has sought the advice of experts who work in this industry and is acting. If Labor are elected, we will seek to rectify the gender pay gap that exists in superannuation in this country through reforms such as ensuring that superannuation continues to be paid when someone goes onto paid parental leave or dad and partner pay. Underperforming funds are a serious issue. We know the outcomes of underperforming funds for people during their life cycle can be rather detrimental and put people at a severe disadvantage compared to those in more superior-performing funds. This reform goes some of the way, but there will be more work to do, and Labor stands ready to do that work if we're elected at the next election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are very proud that we forced this government into agreeing to a royal commission, despite the fact that they voted against it 26 times and despite the fact that they did not want to shine a light on what's been going on in financial services and banking in this country over the last decade. Labor are extremely proud that we were able to achieve that outcome and force this government into a royal commission. Labor have been vindicated. The findings of that royal commission and the shocking evidence that was given through that process vindicated Labor's call for a royal commission. Labor have stood ready to implement the recommendations from that royal commission as quickly as possible. We even offered for the parliament to sit an additional two weeks in March this year to ensure that we had the time to implement the more urgent recommendations that related to issues like grandfathered commissions, which have been the root cause of a lot of the problems in this industry. Unfortunately, the government again delayed, obfuscated and wouldn't deal with the issue. It perfectly highlights their approach to financial services, to superannuation, to advice and to what's been going on in banking and financial services over the course of the last decade, and it's a great shame. If Labor are elected at the next election we will make sure that, as quickly as possible, we get on with the job of implementing those royal commission recommendations through our implementation task force, in consultation with the industry, to improve the regulation that exists in this area and, importantly, to improve financial services, including superannuation, outcomes for people in this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  Today we are debating legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2019, to tighten up the administration and regulation of our superannuation industry. This stands in contrast to decisions that have been made by this government. A year or so ago we had a decision that reduced the penalty rates payable to workers on Sundays and public holidays. It reduced the take-home pay for many of our lowest-paid working Australians. Labor said to the government and to the Australian people, 'We can fix this.' We proposed legislation to resolve this issue, and the government said no. The government said no because it said, 'Well, that was the decision of an independent tribunal. We should not legislate around that problem.' In doing that, not only did the government show its hypocrisyâhypocrisy because it was exactly the opposite of what it said when it came to the issue of safe rates, an issue that it was so opposed to that not only did it reverse the decision of the tribunal in that matter but it abolished the entire tribunalâbut it's also entirely contrary to the way in which we saw the superannuation system develop in this country. In the case of our superannuation system, we saw a case brought in the commission to expand superannuation so that it applied to all working Australians. The commission declined to make that decision, and the parliament, as the sovereign body of this nation, said, 'We can resolve this through legislation.' The parliament went and legislated to create a compulsory superannuation system in this country. In that regard it stands in stark contrast to the position adopted by this government when it comes to the issue of penalty rates. The issue is wholly competent and wholly possible for this parliament to resolve, and indeed it should do so. If there is a Bill Shorten government after the next election, this parliament will legislate to fix the penalty rates issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, in highlighting that stark contrast, we are dealing with legislation to further tighten up and improve our superannuation system in Australia. This bill, which deals with the accountability and outcomes of superannuation, is vitally important, because, through the creation of our universal superannuation system here in this country, we have created and developed one of the largest bodies of savings in the world. It is important for every working Australian that their money, the money that is looked after by superannuation trustees, is properly governed and that they can have confidence that the money they are contributing to superannuation, whether through the superannuation guarantee or through a voluntary contribution, will not only be there in the future for them to rely on but will be protected against bad governance and bad investment decisions. It also provides an opportunity for Australians to be in a fund that will actually provide good returns for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way in which this legislation was introduced into this parliament highlights the way in which the coalition government really isn't committed to superannuation for ordinary working Australians. I say that because, when you look at what this bill is targeted at, in a sense what it is doing is making life harder for trustees administering the MySuper-style accounts of most ordinary Australians, but it is not imposing those regulations on many of the retail funds and choice funds out there. The curiousness of that is this: who does that then provide a benefit for? It certainly doesn't protect the people who have put their money into types of superannuation accounts other than MySuper. What it does to it easier for the banks and other superannuation funds to make a profit from the money that is being put into those superannuation accounts. It lets them off the hook while trying to apply proper scrutiny of MySuper. There is no criticism of that. Why on earth would you let those others off the hook? It reflects the priorities of this government. It is the priorities of this government that have delivered proposed massive tax cuts for the big end of town, but they don't look after ordinary working Australians. It is these perverse priorities from this government that led to the initial bill that we saw here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, the government has seen the light, because of the pressure applied by our shadow minister for financial services, in seeing that this legislation had to be amended. The Senate facilitated that occurring through a range of government and opposition supported amendments going through. What the bill as a whole is trying to do is very important. It is very important to make sure that APRA, as the prudential regulator overseeing one of the biggest bodies of savings in the world, is not at risk, because when you create a body of savings like that it is a honey pot. People see that as an opportunity to make their own money. We need to make sure that that money is available for the people who need to rely on it in their retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have now made sure that a lot of the additional regulation that was going to apply just to MySuper accounts or just to trustees managing MySuper products will now apply more generally to retail funds across the board so that we have these protections protecting all superannuation accounts. There are also the protections around outcomes and reporting on those things and making sure that the technical amendments mean that the outcome tests that will be applied will actually be appropriate and will actually deliver on the outcomes. We've made sure that there will be good penalties that can be applied to the directors of these trustees so that they take responsibility for the things that they do as directors of trustees of superannuation funds. A huge burden of responsibility is placed on them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at what's happened, in particular, in retail fundsâthe returns that are being provided, the lack of transparency that has existed in relation to those returns, and the fees that are baked into those lower returnsâit is quite clear that people in Australia have effectively been ripped off in relation to some of these superannuation funds. That, fundamentally, is unfair to them. It is unfair to them but it is also unfair to the Australian taxpayer. When people are getting lower returns, when people end up having up to $100,000 less in their retirement savings because of being gouged on fees or having substantially lower returns because of the fees baked into those funds, it means that they are more likely to end up on the pension scheme sooner and it means that they are then going to have to draw on taxpayer funds in that regard. It is good that we have a pension scheme that operates there as a safety netâabsolutelyâbut it shouldn't have to kick in because of bad management and bad investment decisions by retail funds. So, having those outcome tests, making sure that directors are responsible for meeting the best interests of superannuants and holding those directors to account for that, is very, very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will join a suite of other matters that Labor wishes to introduce when it comes to superannuation. I have been having a long-running correspondence discussion, we might call it, with the Commissioner of Taxation. It results from a constituent of mine whose employer had not been paying his superannuation. His employer closed up business and left his superannuation account deficient of funds. The ATO has been pursuing this person, the employer, for a whole range of unpaid taxes, including the superannuation guarantee payments. It is good that the ATO does that. Interestingly, there is nothing that my constituent can do to try and force those funds out of his former employer. Also, there is nothing that my constituent can do to find out when he can expect those superannuation funds to be paid, even though the former employer has entered into a payment arrangement with the ATO. I raised this with the commissioner and said, 'Why can't you tell him?' and I was told that it is because of the privacy provisions in the tax act. I said, 'That's curious, because the privacy provisions in the tax act say that you can't disclose matters that don't relate to the person seeking the information,' because obviously it is his money. It is his superannuation account that the money is going into. Those matters directly relate to him.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My beef may well be with the operation of those privacy provisions, but what it also points out is that there is something lacking in the way in which ordinary working Australians can go about enforcing what is effectively an employment right, which is to be paid their full remuneration when they get their weekly, fortnightly or monthly pay packet and for that money to end up in their superannuation account. That's why it is so crucial toâand this is why Labor has adopted this policy going into this electionâmake those superannuation guarantee payments part of the National Employment Standards, something that can be enforced directly against the employer, something that can make sure that employees can get the funds to which they are entitled. It is about creating savings for taxpayers. It is about that way which we have created in Australia where people can look after their own retirement better by having superannuation accessible and available, at their disposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that I bring it back to the fundamental point that I raised at the beginningâLabor were the architects of our superannuation system here in Australia. We were the architects of it because, despite the Industrial Relations Commission saying, 'We're not going to make an order; we are not going to create an award that puts this into our employment system,' Labor in government said: 'We hear what you are saying, Commission, but we are going to legislate it anyway. We are going to introduce a system that will create one of the largest bodies of savings in the world and put Australians in a better place to manage and fund their own retirement.' We made those decisions, and do you know what? Every time we have taken a decision like that, for the benefit of working Australians in this country, the Liberal Party and the National Party, the members of the coalition, have opposed it. The only time they ever do anything that might even look vaguely like it is going to be in support of that system, it is a mechanism to avoid the superannuation system. It is a mechanism for making sure that a body of people that already are clearly wealthy enough to look after themselves can save even more tax dollars through the system, creating another loophole. They've never been about making sure that this system works for the vast majority of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see it in the way this bill was drafted originally. Yes, they went after MySuperâgood. That's excellent. But they left open the minefield when it came to all the other superannuation fundsânot because they saw that the highest risk was in MySuper but because it would benefit their friends at the top end of town and the banks that were managing all of these superannuation accounts. Why should extra scrutiny be applied to them? Well, I can't think! Have there been any other criticisms of the banks and the managers of these retail funds over the last year or so? Let me have a think about that. Oh, there was that royal commission that they opposed 26 times! Twenty-six times they opposed a royal commission. The royal commission made recommendations about things that should be changed. If it weren't for the pressure that was applied by Labor to make sure that these sorts of changes were applied across the board and we had those amendments made in the Senate, we wouldn't be able to stand here today and provide the support for this legislation in the way that we do now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is good that we have this legislation before us. As I say, we support it. But, fundamentally, what we on the Labor side of this parliament do here is support the superannuation system providing better retirement incomes and support for ordinary working Australians. We want to make sureâand that's why it was important that the scope of this legislation was expanded and why we will take this further in government if we are successful at the next electionâthere are the proper administration and regulatory supports around this huge body of savings. As I said before, it acts as a honey pot. It acts as a way in which people can say: 'I can make a fee out of that. I can make a profit out of that. I can get an aspect of that.' We have seen it with property developers trying to get people to put their superannuation funds into apartments. We have seen it with the fees being gouged out of certain retail funds. We have seen it in the low returns over many superannuation accounts that are available to people in Australia. Clearly there is a problem when it comes to the nature of competition in this sector if we have so many different accounts returning so many suboptimal returns for Australia's future retirees. That forebodes a fundamental problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why it is important that we have this legislation apply in a much broader way. It is good that the government got around to seeing these amendments come to fruition through the Senate. As I say, Labor will make sure that people's retirement incomes are protected by making sure that their right to their superannuation guarantee payment is part of the National Employment Standards. I look forward to the day, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, as I suspect you do too, that a Labor government, hopefully in just a few months, will be able to start bringing about those changes as well.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWT" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  I thank all those who have made a contribution to the debate. The super industry is a $2.7 trillion industry and it is critical that the system is modern and solely focused on delivering outcomes for members. A modern super system empowers members and provides for transparency around fund activities and performance. Many of the measures in the bill will be on the policy agenda for several years and have been recommended by past reviews into superâincluding, most recently, by the Productivity Commission, which labelled them 'a policy must-have'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill implements two critical recommendations by the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. The measures in this bill will strengthen the regulator's power and improve accountability, transparency and, ultimately, member outcomes. This will boost members' confidence that their money is being managed in their best interests. The government wants a super system that delivers outcomes for the benefits of membersânot shareholders, directors, employers or trade unions. I am confident the measures in the bill will achieve these outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 creates a requirement for both MySuper and choice products to consider the appropriateness of their product on an annual basis via the new outcomes test. It also creates an obligation on all trustees to promote the financial interests of members. This will boost the accountability of trustees and ensure that the outcomes delivered to members are in their best interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 gives APRA more scope to cancel an application or cancel a MySuper application where it believes the trustee will not comply with the obligations. This will improve the quality of default MySuper products by allowing APRA to refuse or cancel an authority to offer a MySuper product if it has reason to believe the trustee may fail to comply with its obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill delivers on both a recommendation of the Financial System Inquiry the government accepted in 2015 and a recommendation of the royal commission into misconduct in the banking, super and financial services industry. It will strengthen the accountability of trustees and directors by making them subject to civil and criminal penalties for breaches of their duties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 gives APRA the power to reject a change in the ownership of a corporate trustee. Given the potentially detrimental outcomes that may arise from the mismanagement of funds, we believe that no-one should be able to own or control a super fund without APRA's approval.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong regulator is crucial for ensuring confidence in the super system, and schedule 5 of the bill will ensure this. The new directions power will harmonise APRA's directions powers across credit unions, friendly societies and the banking, insurance and super industries. This will enable APRA to intervene at an early stage to address prudential concerns in a manner that ensures the required actions are in the best interests of members. It will enhance APRA's powers to issue directions to a trustee, or its connected entity, to take, or refrain from taking, specific action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 of the bill introduces a workable arrangement for portfolio holding disclosures. It will boost transparency for members and will also ensure that Australia's system is consistent with international best practice. The approach in the bill will significantly reduce the complexity of the current law, which was introduced in 2012 but has never commenced operation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 7 improves transparency by introducing a requirement for super funds to hold annual members' meetings. This will give members the ability to hold trustees accountable for the operation and performance of their funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 8 enables APRA and fund members to gain a more complete understanding of how funds are spending members' moneys, and whether this is in the best interest of members, via a new reporting standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, schedule 9 includes a measures to implement another recommendation of the royal commission, around incentivising employers. The measure will strengthen the effectiveness of the prohibition of inducements to employers by trustees and allow civil and criminal penalties to be imposed on trustees that use goods or services to induce employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We consulted with stakeholders in the development of this legislation. Dozens of written submissions were received from industry and individuals on the draft legislation, and over 20 organisations participated in multiple roundtables. There was strong support for the policy intent of the bill. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the design of the bill. Once again, we make it very clear that the government are focused on ensuring Australia's super system delivers outcomes for all Australians first and foremost, not for any self-interest in the industry. I am confident the measures in this bill will achieve these outcomes. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:23</span>):  I apologise for getting up to speak too early, but I am very keen because of course the amendments that have been returned to this House are amendments that were suggested to the government by the opposition, and I want to thank the government for supporting the amendments. I think they make it a better bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the intent behind the bill is absolutely right. We need to ensure that we don't have corporations gaming the arrangements for providing protection for workers who are unfortunately victims of corporate collapse or bankruptcy. We have had circumstances where we have had corporations gaming arrangements where they have literally deliberately forced their own company into receivership and then have expected the taxpayers to underwrite all the costs, and I think the government has quite rightly sought to remedy that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not all of the amendments that we have suggested to the government have been accepted, but predominantly they have been. We thank the government for that. We thank the minister for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms in this bill are sensible and, in some cases, adopt, as I say, announced Labor policy. Labor is pleased to see that this bill has come back to the House with amendments. Labor thanks the government for their cooperation, for example, in moving amendments to give unions standing to represent workers to assist them in obtaining compensation for loss of entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, on Christmas Eve last year I had to speak to 200 workers in my electorate who had had the misfortune of being sacked by a company that had closed down. Some of those workers are now working for a company that has a family relationship with the company that was closed down. They have not been provided with all their entitlements. That company's under investigation for seeking the FEG to provide the money for these workers. There are some real questions around that. I addressed over 100 workers on Christmas Eve, some of whom had worked for that company for 20 years. They have not received the annual leave that was owed to them. They have not received redundancy. They have had their superannuation ripped off. At the same time, that same company was seeking to have the Commonwealthâthis current governmentâpay for those workers' liabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rightly, of course, the FEG is there to look after those workers, but we have to ensure that if there are companies that are doing the wrong thing they are brought to account. This bill helps that. The government moved the amendments in the Senate. I thank the government and the minister for that. We didn't agree on all the mattersâthere was one amendment that the minister and the government chose not to supportâbut I think the amendments strengthen the bill. This is a good bill. This is the way the parliament should operate. The government has come up with a good idea. We'd hoped to make it better. The government has been gracious enough to support amendments which I think strengthen the bill. The intent behind the bill was always good. It's just better now because of the passing of these amendments by the Senate and, hopefully, by this House.</span>

It is very important that workers' entitlements are protected. That is what the government is doing. It's quite wrong when the Australian taxpayer is asked to pick up the tab because of a deliberate structural decision made by unscrupulous employers who are seeking to shift their responsibilities to someone else. We will not stand for that. We have noticed that there has been an explosion in claims under the FEG scheme. We will not stand for it. We will not see the Australian taxpayer ripped off and we will not see workers ripped off.</span>

Where the amendments of the opposition will do no harm, we will not stand in the way of those amendments. We have made some improvements to the bill, and I thank those opposite for their cooperation in relation to those matters. As a result, we can come together, stand together and say that this is indeed a bill that will improve the lives of many millions of Australians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might commence by starting this speech by paying tribute to all those who suffered and lost their lives and lost loved ones as a result of the Christchurch terrorist attack on Friday, 15 March 2019. The victims, their families and their loved ones; the Muslim community in New Zealand and Australia and around the world; and New Zealanders, who have been shocked and saddened by that vile act, know, of course, that Australia stands with them. The horror of that act was brought to the world in real time and the platforms that were used to connect with the world were turned against us to amplify the shooter's message of hate and intolerance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The relevant footage was broadcast for 17 minutes without interruption and it was another 12 minutes after that point in time that the first user report on the original video was received by Facebook. The material was live-streamed on Facebook and available on that platform for almost an hour and 10 minutes until the first attempts were made to take it down. Simply put, we find that unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government expects that internet platforms should take responsibility for preventing the spread of abhorrent violent material online. The internet is not an ungoverned space. Together, we must act to ensure that perpetrators and their accomplices cannot leverage online platforms for the purposes of spreading their violent and extreme fanatical propaganda. These platforms should not be weaponised for evil purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Criminal Code Amendment (Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material) Bill represents an important step in this process. It will ensure that hosting and content services expeditiously remove abhorrent violent material and notify the Australian Federal Police when it appears on their platforms. Internet platforms must take the risks posed by the spread of abhorrent violent material online seriously. The new offences will therefore be accompanied by criminal penalties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the removal of abhorrent violent material, it is clear that live-streaming and other video platforms can and will continue to be abused to spread messages of hate and terror, and this cannot be allowed to continue. The bill addresses this risk by requiring the providers of online content and hosting services, whose services can be used to access abhorrent violent material, to ensure the expeditious removal of that material. This will apply when the material is reasonably capable of being accessed within Australia, regardless of whether the content or hosting service is providing from within or outside of Australia. It is important to ensure that this offence is limited to the worst types of material that can be shared online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Platforms will only be required to ensure the expeditious removal of audiovisual or audiovisual material that is recorded by the perpetrator or an accomplice and that depicts specified abhorrent acts and violent conduct. This is defined to mean acts of terrorism, murder, attempted murder, torture, rape or kidnapping.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does include defences to the offence in certain circumstances, including for law enforcement purposes where the material relates to a news or current affairs report that is in the public interest, for court and tribunal proceedings where the accessibility of the material is for lawful advocacy purposes and where the accessibility of the material relates to research or artistic works created in good faith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These offences will attract penalties of up to $2.1 million or three years imprisonment, or both, for individuals, and bodies corporate will face penalties of up to $10.5 million or 10 per cent of the annual turnover of the body corporate. There should be no mistake made. These very serious penalties are warranted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Internet platforms provide immense value to the Australian community, but recent events have shown that they can also be used for great harm and as a platform to spread violent and dangerous ideologies. These penalties will send a clear message that the Australian government expects the providers of online content and hosting services to take responsibility for the use of their platforms to share abhorrent violent material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notably, proceedings for an offence against these provisions would require the written consent of the Attorney-General, which acts as an important safeguard against inappropriate prosecutions and allows a wide range of circumstances to be taken into account before proceeding to any prosecution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the eSafety Commissioner's new notice power, the new offence will be supported by a new power by the eSafety Commissioner to issue a notice advising that a content or hosting service is being used to host abhorrent violent material. This will put the service on notice that it is being used to disseminate the relevant material. Once a notice has been given, that service will have no excuse for failing to comply with its obligation to remove that material as expeditiously as possible. As such, the effect of the notice will be to create presumptions that the operator of the service was reckless as to whether the abhorrent violent material could be accessed on their service and that the material in question was abhorrent violent material. Both of these presumptions can be rebutted if the operator of the service is able to produce evidence to the contrary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, it is critical that Australian law enforcement agencies are able to promptly investigate conduct depicted in abhorrent violent material that may be occurring in Australia and is being shared online. The bill, therefore, introduces a new offence applying to the providers of internet hosting or content services who fail to refer details of abhorrent violent material that records or streams conduct that has occurred or is occurring in Australia to the AFP. This referral must take place within a reasonable time after the provider has become aware of the existence of the material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The providers of internet hosting and content services are uniquely placed to bring this material to the attention of law enforcement authorities. Prompt referrals will assist the AFP not only to investigate past incidents but also to track events that are unfolding in real time and potentially minimise the harm generated from ongoing access to this material. In practice, it is likely that providers will become aware of a vast array of abhorrent violent material that is already in the public domain. It would serve no practical purpose to refer such material to the AFP and would create a significant administrative burden on all parties. It is, therefore, a defence to this obligation if the provider reasonably believes that the details of the material are already known to the AFP. The referral of material involving serious violent criminal conduct is very important. Failure to comply will be a serious matter and will attract penalties of up to $168,000 for an individual and $840,000 for a body corporate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the events of Christchurch have shown us that internet platforms can be used to spread messages of hate and terror, and this bill forms an important part of the Australian government's response to these events. Internet platforms have the means to prevent the spread of abhorrent violent material and will face criminal sanction if they do not work expeditiously to remove such material. Separately, the government has announced a task force that includes industry stakeholders to examine immediate and longer term actions with a focus on prevention, transparency and response times.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  The terrorist atrocity committed in New Zealand on 15 March was on unspeakable act of violence committed by a coward against a defenceless group of worshippers at prayer. I take this opportunity to once again condemn, on behalf of Labor and all Australians, that act of terrorism that has brought so much death and so much pain to the people of New Zealand, and to so many people and to so many communities beyond New Zealand. I say again that an attack on any religion is an attack on all religions; it is an assault on our common humanity. We feel a national shame that an Australian was the perpetrator of this act of hate-fuelled violence in which 50 innocents were murdered. But his extreme right-wing ideology manifested last month in his act of cowardice and evil does not represent Australia or our values and beliefs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The attacker's aim was to spread terror and to divide our community, and it was this goalâa common thread in terrorist atrocities, whatever their particular ideologyâthat led the perpetrator to record his atrocity and to seek to circulate it online. At the time, we called on all Australians not to share that awful footage, not to watch it and not to do anything that might in any way serve the objectives of the terrorist who committed this inhuman act of evil. But there is more we can do, as members of the Australian parliament, to stop the spread of terrorist materials produced by the perpetrators of these atrocities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me now to the bill before the House, the Criminal Code Amendment (Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material) Bill 2019. This bill represents the Morrison government's attempt to respond to the problem of terrorists seeking to spread recordings of their crimes through social media and other online platforms. Labor believes that social media companies must do more in preventing the dissemination of material produced by terrorists showing off their crimes. For that reason, Labor willâdespite reservations I will explain shortlyâbe supporting the passage of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I must be clear: this bill is clumsy and flawed in many respects. And that is in part because the government has been too cowardly to hold an adequate number of parliamentary sitting days before the election this year, so the parliament is being forced to deal with this bill on a ridiculous timetable. And it is in part because the government has been too inept to properly consult with the Australian technology industry and media companies, and the community, about the impacts of this bill on them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Morrison government realised just how difficult it was for them when this parliament sitsâin large part because of how many of their failures and scandals come to light through the scrutiny the parliament of Australia providesâthey shamefully cut the number of days this parliament would sit before the election. In November last year, this government decided that the parliament would only sit for 10 days in 2019 prior to the election being called. Today is only the 10th sitting day of this House in 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Sturt declared that the sitting calendar issue was an example of 'inside-the-bubble issues'. What arrogance to believe that the government could predict with confidence that no events would occur over some six months before the election that might require this parliament's attention. What arrogance to suggest that laws that are supposedly urgent, like this one, are just 'bubble issues' the Liberal Party can't be bothered taking the time to deal with properly. What a self-serving and irresponsible dereliction of their responsibilities as the government of this nation. One of the consequences of that reckless and cowardly decision of the Morrison government to drastically shorten the parliament's time this year is that important and difficult laws such as this bill have to be rushed to such an extent that they cannot be properly drafted, consulted on or debated in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor always seeks to work in a constructive and bipartisan manner on matters of national security. We have the track record to prove it through our constructive engagement on some 20 national security bills introduced by this government over the last 5Â½ years. In particular, in the last 5Â½ years, government and opposition members of the bipartisan Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security have worked together to make well over 300 bipartisan recommendations to change, improve and strengthen those 20 national security bills. On each occasion, the bill presented to the parliament required amendments to improve its operation and to deal with unintended consequences the government had not foreseen. This important process, in which national security bills are reviewed by the intelligence committee, has not occurred with this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say again: Labor always seeks to work in a constructive and bipartisan manner on matters of national security. But we are not bipartisan on the trashing of the proper processes that are needed to get our national security laws right. Labor received this bill just after 5 pm on Monday this week. It was rushed through the other place last night without any debate. If it is to become law, it must pass this House by the end of the day. This is no way to approach lawmaking in this country, and the precedent this government has set, not just on this bill, is atrocious. Not even New Zealand, where the Christchurch atrocity occurred, has attempted to make this change in such a short time frame. However, because Labor agrees that the streaming of the Christchurch terror attack has shown that there is a need for measures to prevent such conduct occurring in the future, Labor will not stand in the way of the Morrison government's clumsy attempt to deal with this issue, as set out in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do want to briefly outline some of the key problems that have come to light regarding these laws that will need to be addressed through an urgent committee process. I emphasise that these are just some of the problems that we've been able to identify in the short time we've had this bill. The bill could potentially undermine Australia's important security cooperation with the United States by requiring US internet providers to share content data with the Australian Federal Police, in breach of US law. The bill may encourage proactive surveillance of internet users by social media platforms and of the vast volumes of user-generated content being uploaded at any given minute. So, at the same time that we're worried about service providers like Facebook intruding on the privacy of users, this bill calls on those same platforms to constantly be analysing the content of every communications user across their platforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill could have an adverse impact on legitimate whistleblowing activity. The bill draws a seemingly arbitrary distinction between, on the one hand, a television station that broadcasts terrorist content and, on the other hand, a website hosting terrorist content. A television network could broadcast abhorrent violent material over the airwaves and not be captured by this bill, whereas Twitter could be prosecuted if a user tweeted the same video. Poor and inconsistent drafting is likely to have other negative implications for the effective operation of these laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, despite the government announcing that a key purpose of this legislation was to enable the jailing of executives of multinational social media giants who breach its provisions, the bill does not do this. The framework in this bill represents a fundamental shift for online companies which are, generally speaking, platforms geared towards facilitating the sharing of content, rather than being structured around monitoring for the removal of content or proactive notification to third-party law enforcement agencies. The lack of consultation on this bill means that the government has not even considered the practical difficulties and significant compliance costs that these new laws will impose on a large number of companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Labor agrees that tech giants like Facebook must do more to stop the use of their platforms to spread abhorrent terrorist materials, hundreds of much smaller companies are also caught by this bill, many of which may not have the resources or technical capabilities required to comply with the onerous new regulation imposed by this bill. It is also unclear what additional resources either the AFP or the eSafety Commissioner have been provided with in order to manage the potential influx of notifications from online companies. The government has not said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All these problems have been clearly explained to the government, but these explanations have apparently fallen on deaf ears. This is no way to govern. But, in the few days we've had this bill, Labor have been listening and, if elected, a Shorten Labor government will immediately move to address these and other problems identified with this bill as a matter of priority. Specifically, in order to provide this bill with the scrutiny it should have had and in order to ensure that the problems I've just outlined are dealt with, if a Shorten Labor government is elected in May, we will refer this law to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for consultation and comprehensive review. Neither proper consultation nor proper review has occurred as this chaotic and desperate government careens towards the election. There needs to be proper consultation with not just the social media sector but also traditional media, who are also caught up by this bill and whose legitimate journalism and online news sites will also be impacted on by these laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we need to consult with our allies and other like-minded nations across the world because there is little point in Australia taking unilateral actions that do not mesh properly with existing regulatory frameworks around the world. For example, there is scope to adopt the approach taken by the European Union in response to the 2016 Brussels terrorist attack. In response to that atrocity, in May 2016, the EU agreed with Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube a code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online. This code facilitates users' notification of illegal hate speech on social platforms, provides support to civil society in combating online hate speech and strengthens coordination with national authorities. Reviews of the code have indicated its success in helping to counter online hate speech, and, recently, Instagram, Google+, Snapchat, Dailymotion and Jeuxvideo.com announced their intention to also join the code.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to close with one additional matter. The terrorist atrocity committed in New Zealand last month was clearly driven by an ideology of hatred founded in racial and religious bigotry. The sharing of the footage the gunman recorded was appalling, and we need to take steps to prevent it happening again. But the fundamental evil we are seeking to eradicate is not the sharing of recordings of murderous violence; it is the violence itself. All Australians know well that the seeds of this violence lie in racist ideology, in racist hate speech and in the hate and fear that bigots, left unchecked, will spread.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For over 20 years, since it was enacted by the Labor government of Paul Keating, section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act has drawn the line against racial vilification and protected our citizens and our society from the poisonous effects of racist hate speech. Yet, in the last five years, the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has launched two separate attacks on section 18C, which former Attorney-General George Brandis infamously declared to the Senate was a Liberal government priority because 'people have a right to be bigots, you know'. It is astonishing that any Australian government would work to give a green light to racist hate speech, in support of an imagined right to be bigots, rather than working to defend the right of all Australians to dignity and to safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor were appalled by the actions of the Liberals in attacking section 18C, and we stood with thousands of individuals, legal experts and organisations as well as community groups from across our nation to successfully defend section 18C from these reckless ideological attacks by the Liberals. Labor believes that this Liberal government should accept that Australians do not want more racism and more bigotry in our community, and commit to never seeking to water down our racial hatred protections again. The Prime Minister should likewise insist that his coalition partners, the Nationals, put One Nation last. He cannot distance himself from the party he's in government with. It's not hard. He's the Prime Minister, and he should try to lead for a change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast to the Morrison government's glaring weakness on the issue of racism, Labor's unequivocal view is that racism has no place in modern Australia. Labor believes that the Australian government should be setting an example by standing up against bigotry rather than fighting for the rights of bigots and doing dirty deals with racist parties like One Nation, as the Liberals have been doing.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  We all grieve with New Zealand in the wake of the Christchurch massacre, no more so than in Melbourne, where the significant Muslim community has been devastated by the events in Christchurch, this tragedy, as has our broader community. The community has come together to express its solidarity with our Muslim sisters and brothers and with New Zealand. I take the opportunity to place that on the record here, again, on behalf of myself, the Melbourne community and the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of the Christchurch massacre, it's clear that social media must no longer be an unregulated and lawless place where degrading and horrifying content can be posted and shared, spreading like a poison, harming whoever it touches. Graphic and horrifying footage of innocent people being murdered caused untold harm and furthered the terrorists' evil aims for every second that it remained online, and Facebook took over an hour to respond. The Greens have called for a comprehensive response and review of how our media deals with terrorist acts, violent acts and acts of white supremacy like we saw in Christchurch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's bill, the Criminal Code Amendment (Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material) Bill 2019, was Australia's opportunity to comprehensively address the issue. As I said, the Greens were one of the first voices calling for new laws to protect our multicultural communities and hold the mainstream media and social media giants to standards that reflect their role in a modern democracy. I think it would be fair to say that certainly in this place, in this chamber, there would probably be unanimous agreement that the broadcasting that we saw during the Christchurch massacre was abhorrent and should have been stopped and needs to be stopped in the future. The question is: how do we do that in a way that makes sure it does not have unintended consequences? This bill, and this way of doing it, is not the way to ensure that we strike the right balance, because we don't know whether or not this bill in fact does the job the Attorney-General tells us that it's doing and we do not know whether or not it goes far enough in stopping that kind of hate speech from being broadcast. But we also don't know if it goes too far in the other direction and captures forms of speech or reporting that most people would not want to be criminalised, because this is being rushed through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you have a look at the Senate <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, you will find that this bill was introduced into the Senate at 9.13 last night and passed at 9.13 last night. From the Greens' perspective, the Labor opposition may say they've had a version of this since Monday, but we haven't. And the parliament hasn't. When we are dealing with something that could potentiallyâas the front pages of various papers today suggestâcriminalise journalism, that should have significant scrutiny. Does it do that? I don't know. The parliament probably doesn't know. We've got a very significant bill that is being rushed through before this parliament rises, and Labor is going along with it. That should not occur. When something as significant and important to the Australian people as responding to the abhorrent material that we saw, but which also regulates future journalism, comes before this parliament, we should be very loath to make decisions about that without putting it to scrutiny. As I said, the Senate had a few minutes to debate this last night. It got pushed through. We didn't get a chance to look through it, and other senators probably didn't get a chance to look through it. When we read on the front pages of the papers today that this bill might have a series of unintended consequences, we should pause to make sure that we're doing our job properly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor opposition and the shadow Attorney-Generalâand this isn't a personal comment about the shadow Attorney-General at all; this is about the opposition's positionâjust got up and called the bill 'clumsy and flawed' and called the process 'appalling'. You would think that what they would then do is say, 'We're going to refer the bill to an inquiry.' The shadow Attorney-General just gave a good and eloquent speech about why this bill deserves further scrutiny, but then said that Labor and the government are going to side together to ram this through without us having had the opportunity to consult with stakeholders to determine whether there are unintended consequences. That is not the way that parliament should function. And now we're here in the House being asked to put through a bill that's only been introduced into the House today, on the same day. That is not right. As I said, I expect you would get 100 per cent unanimous agreement across this chamber for the prohibition of broadcasting abhorrent material, but everyone would also be alarmed if we were about to pass something that had unintended consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I, for one, am not prepared to take the government at face value when they say that a bill that they didn't even have the courtesy to show to us until yesterday evening in the Senate and is being introduced in the House today is all completely fine and has no unintended consequences. That is not a way to run a government. When we have the opportunity to say, 'We're not going to say no to the bill; we're just going to ask for it to go to an inquiry,' that is something the opposition should grab with both hands. I heard the opposition say that if they win government they will send the bill to an inquiry. But, firstly, what if they don't? And, secondly, what if One Nation has control of the Senate after the next election and there are some proposed sensible changes that can't get through because they can't get through the Senate? That is why we need to give this bill scrutiny now, before we pass it. It's not right that, as often happens on the last day of parliament, we're asked to pass really important legislation without even the chance to read it or go and talk to our stakeholders about it. When we see things on the front page of the paper that say, 'Hang on; parliament should pause for a moment, because there might be unintended consequences,' and we're not given the chance to do that, that is not right. And the problem with rushing something through is that it potentially undermines the legitimacy of the bill further down the track. Who knows if there are errors in this bill that might stop truly abhorrent content from being broadcast? We just don't know.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I come back to where I started. Of courseâon the part of myself, the Greens and, I suspect, many othersâwe want to see a proper approach to regulating social media and we want to ensure that that kind of horror and terror that we saw is not allowed to be broadcast. No-one would quibble with that, but we want to make sure we're doing it properly and that it doesn't catch legitimate journalists in its wake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I move this amendment to the bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House refers the bill to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for inquiry and report no later than 1 August 2019".</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is an eminently sensible timetable. We could still have this legislation pass expeditiously, if that's what the parliament wants to do. The shadow Attorney-General just stood up and identified three or four big problems with the bill. Well, this would give us a chance to go and fix those. The bill could still be passed, if that was parliament's will, but we would be a bit more confident that it had no unintended consequences andâwho knows?âwe might even close loopholes that might be there in the first place, because this government has actually rushed it. We could actually strengthen it and ensure that this kind of terrible material doesn't find its way onto Facebook or other social media in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This committee is not necessarily our committee of choiceâthere's no Greens representative on this committeeâbut it's one that, as a joint committee, could continue to operate and could sit soon after the election. We could be back here within a very short period of time, within what is effectively a matter of weeks, and pass the bill, if that's what we wanted to do. I do hope that this amendment gets support, and especially gets the support of the opposition, because it's an opportunity to say, 'Yes, the bill can pass, but let's make sure we're doing our job right.'</span>

                    <a href="008Z0" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr PHELPS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I second the amendment. I'd firstly like to convey my sincere condolences to the people of New Zealand for the tragedy in Christchurch, which has been the catalyst for the Criminal Code Amendment (Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material) Bill 2019. The live streaming of this atrocity is abhorrent to us all. However, the proposed amendments to criminal legislation to deal with the live streaming of violent material on social media could have serious unintended consequences, as we've heard here today, and, in the interest of responsible governance, should not be rushed through the parliament. The bill was announced as a reaction to the horrific Christchurch terrorist attacks, which were streamed live across social media. There is no question in my mind about the intent of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Law Council has said that, while steps should be taken to ensure social media is not weaponised to promote hatred and violence, proper consultation must occur to ensure fair and effective legislation. Social media companies must do more to avoid this form of violent content being uploaded and viewed, but making social media companies and their executives criminally liable for the live streaming of criminal content is a serious step which requires careful consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation clearly defines relevant offensive content. The problem is regarding notification. The IT industry is deeply concerned about issues around notification. There are processes already in place to act on notifications, and algorithms are currently being developed to find offensive content so that IT companies can act to remove it. Anyone can upload anything online, and the IT companies don't have to be notified that it is there. Moreover, what does 'expeditious' mean? There is no clear definition of this time line imposed on an IT company, which may not have received a notification of the abhorrent content. Considering that the executors of social media platforms who do not remove the abhorrent material expeditiously can be punished by three years imprisonment or fines equating up to 10 per cent of a platform's annual turnover, the repercussions are great. What does 'expeditiously' mean? Is it five minutes? Is it 15 minutes? Is it an hour? Is it a day? The legislation does not define the meaning of 'expeditious'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the best of intentions, laws formulated as a knee-jerk reaction to a tragic event do not necessarily equate to good legislation and can have myriad unintended consequences. One such unintended consequence is that global IT platforms will bypass Australia to avoid being exposed to this risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key concern with the bill as drafted is that whistleblowers may no longer be able to deploy social media to shine a light on atrocities committed around the world, because social media companies will be required to remove that content for fear of being charged with a crime. Social media can and has been used, including by media organisations and whistleblowers, to draw attention to violent atrocities occurring overseas or criminal conduct by a foreign government, such as injuring or killing its own citizens. The legislation may have a chilling effect on the potential for social media users and media organisations who use social media providers to perform this important public service function. Whistleblowers may unfortunately be prevented from being able to tell these important stories through such providers. Similarly, this may influence the social media platforms and methods that media organisations are able to use to communicate important public interest pieces. If people on social media seek to shine a light on an atrocity or criminality, this is where the bill bites, as there is no defence for social media providers who choose not to remove violent content because the provider believes the material is in the public interest. So the bill could, in effect, lead to censorship of the media, which could undermine the very potential of the fourth estate to hold governments to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Law Council has called for this legislation to be referred to a parliamentary committee for review and consultation. The shadow Attorney-General also said this morning that this should happen, and this is, indeed, the intent of the Greens' amendment. We need to consider how to provide a public interest defence for those who may be captured by the proposed offences but honestly believe on reasonable grounds that they are acting in the public interest in not removing particular material from social media in order to expose criminal content that should be brought to public attention. Consideration could be had to modelling such a public interest defence of similar defences that already exist in other legislation, such as Commonwealth whistleblowing legislation, or the Public Interest Disclosures Act 1994 New South Wales, which provides protection to public officials who report public sector wrongdoing in particular circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any government or, indeed, any major party seeking to govern should be mindful of passing rushed legislation without consulting stakeholders, including the affected industry, or considering the broader implications. It is much better to get this legislation right than to pass flawed laws that will lead to unintended consequences. This bill should be referred to a committee for consideration.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="00AN0" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CIOBO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  I first stood in this chamber on Wednesday, 13 February 2002, to deliver my first speech. I was the 40th member of parliament under the age of 30 since Federation. Now, some 17 years, one month and 22 days later, it's my privilege to rise for the final time in this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I posed the question in my first speech: what is our purpose? It was my intention to outline a road map for my period in this place, a charter to which both I and others could hold me to account, to anchor my decisions and actions in this building to the service of my electors in the pursuit of good government. I spoke of Edmund Burke's observation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, although I said at the time I was not a starry-eyed idealist, I think it's fair to say I have always struggled more with the pragmatic side of politics, preferring instead to stay the course on the idealistic. For me, I always preferred the warmth of the roaring philosophical fire to the early-morning flicker of the pragmatic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much has changed in the 17Â½ years I have been entrusted with the privilege of serving in this place. The Gold Coast's population has nearly doubled in the past two decades. We have seen the rise and rise of China. Innovation, smartphones, the digital economy, social media and automation have all advanced with extraordinary pace. There was no Facebook, no Twitter, no Instagram, no Snapchat in 2001, but many other things have not changed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2001, I joined the Howard government in the task of paying down Labor's debt binge, through prudent economic management. For nearly six years, I was a member of a coalition government that weathered Labor's attacks as they labelled us callous, inequitable, unfair and hard-hearted because we refused to leave the tax-and-spend taps open. I then watched Labor inflict economic damage for six years as they spent and spent and spent, all justifiedâby necessity, in their mindsâbecause of the GFC. Of course, there was little intellectual honestyâthat our major trading partners were driving their economies and powering our economy. And, of course, there was the wastefulness of Labor's spending, from pink batts to cash for clunkers to cash handouts, and school halls for every school, even if they didn't want them. It is little wonder we witnessed our nation's finances deteriorate through tens of billions of dollars of deficit while, at the same time, Labor held that they were delivering year after year of surpluses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, thanks to Tony Abbott and the united team, the coalition was re-elected and the economic and fiscal discipline began again. It culminated earlier this week when the coalition, led by the Treasurerâmy friend of two decades, the member for Kooyongâdelivered the first budget surplus since the last one delivered by the coalition in 2007. And again Labor snipes that we are callous, inequitable, unfair and hard-hearted. I've seen all of this before. I am confident that if Labor is elected we will sadly find our country mired again in deficit, with Labor finding excuse after excuse to justify it. Australia simply cannot afford Labor's big-taxing, big-spending agenda. Labor talk about equity constantly, but they deliver shocking generational inequity as they lumber Australia's next generation with the responsibility of paying for Labor's sweeping gesture policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Campaigning back in 2001 was very different. I think it's fair to say that my first campaign was a little bumpy. The outgoing member for Moncrieff was suing me for $200,000 for defamation and left me with the princely sum of around $1,300 in the campaign account. And, in a city where the main industry and employer is the tourism industry, Ansett Airlines collapsed the day after the September 11 terrorist attack. But we prevailed, through a dedicated team of volunteers and a small band of donors, wonderful party loyalists and supporters like Graham Ward, Jack and Fay Doherty, Winifred, Leer and Marion, many of them now deceased. They were there at the beginning and I don't forget their contributions and support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who have followed my political careerâwhich I guess is mainly confined to my family membersâwould have seen some early evidence of my special gift of successfully always picking the person who had come second in any political contest. As a new MP, at 27, my choice to strongly back Peter Costello over John Howard in some of the leadership tensions made sense. After all, John Howard had been Prime Minister for six yearsâit was only a matter of time! With that strong start, the world was my oyster. With only a couple of exceptions, it was a record of success that for most of the past 17 or 18 years I was always able to pick and back the person who had come secondâthe stuff of legend. My good mates the members for Stirling and Dickson; the former member for Mayo, Jamie Briggs; and the former member for North Sydney, Joe Hockey, would all shift uncomfortably and find fascinating patterns on their shoes to look at whenever they found themselves backing the same aspirant as me in a contest. It was like a reverse <span style="font-style:italic;">Sleeping Beauty</span> fairytale. My kiss would put a person to political sleep for 100 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding this talent, I can reflect on the past 17Â½ years and feel a real sense of pride in what I feel I've been able to achieve and to be a part of. In the early 2000s, I was pleased to run with the rebadged 'ginger group', together with Senator Fifield and the former member for Indi, Sophie Mirabella, to agitate for substantial personal income tax relief and the passage of voluntary student unionism. One of my proudest moments was the campaign I ran, at some personal political cost, against the government's plan for the access cardâlittle more than a national ID card, but with more costs to personal liberties and the individual-state relationship than any purported benefits. I've been pleased to drive some of the very first calls for the revocation of dual citizenship of terrorists and their supporters, as well as the cashless welfare card in the early 2000s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past six years, as a frontbencher I've had the extraordinary privilege of helping to shape our nation's engagement with the world. I particularly want to thank former prime ministers Abbott and Turnbull, as well as Prime Minister Morrison, for their faith and trust in me to steward the various portfolios that I've held. As Joe Hockey's parliamentary secretary in the Treasury portfolio, we worked so well together and executed a flawless G20 finance ministers' stream. I quickly learnt of the relationship between a junior minister and a senior minister when it came to work dispersal and announcements, and I'm able to say I was able to carry that early lesson and put it into good effect in my most recent role in the Defence portfolio!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As alternate governor to the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, I was heartened to see the world work together to focus on development issues, especially the provision of infrastructure across our region, to help improve the lives of millions of people. I was pleased that we strongly backed the initiative to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the AIIBâagain, not without some robust internal discussion. As parliamentary secretary to both Julie Bishop, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Andrew Robb, the Minister for Trade and Investment, I was exposed to the critical interplay between our development and engagement initiatives and our trade and investment relationships. This, too, held me in good stead for subsequent roles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister for International Development and the Pacific, the first for our nation, I was able to steward our relationship with our near South Pacific neighbours. I remember running my eye over the rather lengthy list of recommended inoculations and the subsequent injections I had before commencing sojourns in the Pacific. That said, on each trip, accompanied as I was by the members for Forrest and Ryan and my Labor shadow, the important work Australia performs together with New Zealand in the Pacific region was evident. I firmly believed Australia's national interest was best served by presenting a strong show of bipartisanship in the region. For that reason, I always insisted on having the shadow minister present for most of the engagements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The highlight of my period in this place, though, was the extraordinary honour afforded to me to serve as Australia's Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. I pay particular tribute to my predecessor in that regard, the former member for Goldstein, Andrew Robb, who was a strong advocate for me to replace him in the role. We still catch up semi-regularly, and it's fair to say we share a similar view of how Australia should engage with the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following in Andrew's footsteps was no easy feat. He had finalised critical trade deals with China, Japan and Korea, and the economic impact of those deals will be felt for decades. But I was determined to control the narrative, so I highlighted that Andrew had picked the low-hanging fruit and left the hard ones for me! I launched myself into the role, drawing on my experience as Minister for International Development and the Pacific. I was pleased to successfully conclude negotiations on the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations, or PACER, Plus. This was followed shortly thereafter by launching and concluding a comprehensive FTA with Peru. Without divulging any cabinet secrets, as I tabled those agreements before cabinet, it caused my good friend the then Attorney-General, former Senator Brandis, to note, 'Ciobo's more of a small-country specialist.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the years that followed in the role, I was pleased to pursue a number of other critical agreements. The work that was done over a number of yearsâand carried, I think it's very fair to say, by the relationship between former Prime Minister Turnbull and myself, together with President Widodo and my counterpart Minister Lukitaâsaw, most recently in August-September last year, the successful conclusion of negotiations around the IA-CEPA, or the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pursued this agreement with the most vigour of all, because I know that this agreement, the FTA with Indonesia, will be an absolute game changer for this nation. It will ensure that one of our closest neighbours, one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and a country with which Australia will have a very strong and important strategic future, will be brought to bear as a consequence of putting in place this high-quality agreement. I implore Labor to put aside any concerns that they have, in particular around ISDS clauses in that agreement, to recognise that to focus on that, which more than anything else protects Australian businesses, would be to lose sight of the much bigger picture about the value of this agreement in our bilateral agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, I was very focused on making sure that we concluded a deal with Hong Kong. Goods into Hong Kong were tariff free, but we were able to lock that at zero going forward. But the key with the Hong Kong deal was to focus on the access that we could have around services. In that respect, opening up that market and all that flows from that, particularly with respect to mainland China, was also critical. I was so pleased to see Senator Birmingham conclude and sign that deal only a matter of a week or two ago in Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pushed throughout Latin America, recognising the real potential of Latin America with respect to Australia diversifying its economic interests. We know our major trading partners lie in this region, but that just reinforces why we need to ensure the continued diversification of our export markets, and in that respect Latin America is critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Commencing a free trade agreement with the Pacific Allianceâthe countries of Colombia, Mexico, Chile and Peruâwas absolutely critical. That agreement too, I'm pleased to say, is very, very near conclusion and very possibly will be concluded before the end of this year. I was pleased, with my counterpart, Liam Fox, to commence and put in place the very first working group for a comprehensive FTA post Brexit with the UK. This, of course, would represent a return in many respects to not only a critical market for Australia but also a market of tremendous potential, especially for our high-quality agricultural products and, in particular, wine. The UKâonce they find their pathway forward from Brexitâwill represent a crucial market for Australia. I was pleased that I was able to position Australia to be at the very front of the queue when it comes to concluding that FTA, likewise putting in place the necessary requirements around the scoping document and feasibility study to commence negotiations for an FTA with the European Union. This will take some time. Any negotiation with the European Union takes time, as the Brits will attest. But, that notwithstanding, the opportunity with what is our single biggest export market, aside from China, will be a very important agreement and one that will hold, again, this nation's diversified export potential at its very core for decades to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another critical aspect that I was very pleased to be able to conclude successfully was the CPTPP, or the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. This agreement came off the back of the then defunct TPP, delivered by my predecessor, Andrew Robb, but thwarted by the decision that President Trump made with respect to the United States. To have been able to pull it togetherânotwithstanding the odd curveball from the Canadiansâmeant that we were able to cement in place one of the most comprehensive, far-reaching and ambitious trade agreements, through the CPTPP, that Australia will ever face. I spent years working on pulling that back together. Again, I want to acknowledge the incredible work that was done by all leaders and which we as trade ministers had the good fortune to lock into place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the tourism front, I was pleased to see incredible inbound numbers and spend by tourists. I was pleased to launch, for the very first time, a nation brand working group, headed by Andrew Forrest, to drive a brand for this country that we know can make sure that Australia represents itself under one banner globally. The conclusion of that nation brand will help to ensure that our country is recognised not only for its high-quality agricultural exports but also for its services exports and the attractiveness of the tourism industry. I note as well that we were able to do so recognising that we wanted to grow not just numbers but spend, and spend into this country has been growing at more than nine per cent per annum for the past several years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We took some risks. Of course, the launch of the 'son of Dundee' campaign in the US around Super Bowl was a big political risk. I think it's fair to say that a number of tourism ministers before me had less success when it came to new tourism marketing campaigns for this country, and I learned some lessons from their experiences. But I'm pleased to say that we have seen, now, the fruit from that investment, with growth from the United States in particular being incredibly strong. It's a crucial industryâin particular, for my city of the Gold Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the party supporters who put me in this place. I've made the comment at numerous party events that, but for the support of the party membership, their faith in me and their privilege of pre-selecting me, I wouldn't have been able to stand in this chamber for the past 17Â½ years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to, in particular, thank Lynda Woods, my FDC chairman. Lynda has been an absolute staple for me and for the party in Moncrieff for well over a decade, and I want to thank her in particular for the support that she has provided meâlikewise, Viv and Di Grayson, and the now deceased Mike Milosevic, and his wife, Donna. I want to thank all of those who worked on pre-polls, standing there for weeks on end providing support, and of course those who were there from the very beginningâLee Benjamin, Arthur Chrenkoff and Darren Sly, who played such a critical role from their time in the Young Liberals supporting me in my very first preselection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the Young Liberals as well. I've always believed they are such a critical foundation stone for our party's future. The Gold Coast Young Liberals have been a part of my life since I was 18 years old and will continue to be. I thank each and every one of them for the incredible effort they went to and the support they provided me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My staffâwe all know in this place we couldn't do anything without our staffâhave been terrific. My longest-serving staff member, Alistair Mitchell, tells me that over the past 17Â½ years I've had 86 staff who have moved through the various offices that I've occupied. But I particularly want to thank Kathy, Kylie, Karen, Bec, James, Kristian, Ben, Jackson, and ministerial staff Brendan Berne, Gisele, Angus, Doug, Drew and Britney. All of them have played a critical role in me achieving what it was that I was able to achieve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Karly for her support and work, and I wish her the very best of luck. Karly will be running on Saturday for preselection for my seat, and I think she would make a terrific member in this placeâbut ultimately it's a decision, of course, for the Moncrieff preselectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alistair Mitchell, who's in the advisers box, has been with me for 13Â½ years. Alistair has always been someone of impeccable and prudent political advice. He's shaved off some of my excessesânot nearly enough, I think he would say. But he is someone who has been absolutely fundamental to all that I've achieved in this place, and I thank Alistair sincerely and from the bottom of my heart for the incredible working relationship that we've had over 13 years. I think it's fair to say that my strengths are your weaknesses and your weaknesses are my strengths, and I think that's a terrific political result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank early supporters Stuart Bruce, Darryl Gregor, and Tony and Thea Cochrane. They were there from the outset and they've supported me every step of the journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place, I've always focused on relationships. Relationships, I believe, are what make this building. They're what get political deals done. They're what get policy outcomes. In particular, the former member for North Sydney, Joe Hockey; the Attorney-General, Christian Porter; the member for Aston; the member for Wannon; Senator Fifield; Senators Brandis and Mason; the member for Leichhardt; and, of course, previous Senator Santoroâall of these peopleâhave been such wonderful friends and mates, and it's been a privilege to work alongside them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the member for Curtin, Julie Bishop, with whom I had a terrific working relationship in the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio. I also want to thank the member for Flinders, Greg Hunt. I said the other day that the member for Flinders had delivered me my happiest day in this place, and I think he recognises the importance of it. In the gallery today I have a number of family members and colleagues. But, in particular, I've got my son Asher, who's sitting up there. Asher is a heart kid, as many of you know. His experience was a tough one for Astra and meânot so tough for him. But I am so profoundly proud of the support that Greg has given me when it comes to Heartkids, and I was so touched that the member for Kooyong was able to refer to the first initiative that we've made around Heartkids as part of a research mission. This is not about Asher; this is about the families that will follow in our footsteps. Weâand Asher, in particular, with his experienceâhave been so incredibly blessed, but there are so many parents for whom heart kids become heart angels. For those parents, the $26 million that the government is investing into HeartKidsâinto congenital heart defects in childrenâis just so critical. That would not have happened without the support of the member for Flinders, and I am exceptionally grateful to him for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge my mum and dad. Mum and Dad aren't here today, but they have backed me and supported me every step of the journey in this place. They are wonderful parents. My father came to this country from Italy as a refugee. I think it's fair to sayâas I said to Minister Canavan, one Italian to anotherâI'm not an Italian citizen. We ran through that comprehensively, and I'm pleased to say that there were no problems there. But, notwithstanding that, my parents instilled in me from a very early age the importance of a sound foundation in family and a work ethos, and I'm so incredibly grateful to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude on this: my decision to not recontest the forthcoming federal election is based on many things, and I've thought about it for some time. But, in particular, it's also to show my sons, Asher and Tennyson, that, in life, you need to get out of your comfort zone. Getting out of your comfort zone and doing something different is just so important after you feel you've made a contribution. I've never wanted to be a time server in this place and I leave knowing that I've been able to achieve an extraordinary amount in this role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Relations are critical and, in that sense, I particularly want to acknowledge, in the member for Stirling and the member for Dickson, some of the best friendships that I've made here. Those two have been a fundamental part of the last 17Â½ yearsâor, in the member for Stirling's case, the last 15 yearsâtogether. They are political brothers of mine and it will be a very different place without us all being able to come together. I thank them for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there is my wife, Astra. Astra has been rock-solid with me on every step of this journey. I don't say 'behind me'. I don't say she 'supported me'. We've stood beside each other. We were starry-eyed idealists, I think, when I first started in this role. Now we're more prudent and, I guess, a little weathered and we're both realistic. But, through it all, we know that the bond of love and friendship that we have together has meant that this has been an extraordinary journey. I can truly say that none of it would have been possible without the love and support of my wife, Astra. So to her, Asher and Tennyson: thank you so much for the privilege of serving in this place. And to all of my colleagues here: it has been an honour and a joy. I cannot thank the chamber enough.</span>

                  <a href="123674" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McGOWAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  On indulgence: hello, everybody, and thank you for coming. Six years ago, when I rose to make my first speech, the gallery was full. My community was engaged, supportive and present. Today, as I rise to make my last speech, it's much the same. Back then, I quoted Margaret Mead: 'Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.' And how true that is. To the people of Indi in this parliament, thank you for enabling us to be the change we want to see. There is so much more to do. Beginning with the end in mind, my call to action is: our work is not yet doneâdon't get mad, get elected!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a short summary: since that first speech, what have I done? I've delivered 525 speeches and 15 private members' bills, asked 74 questions without notice, moved 35 motions and made 18 amendments to legislation. Over 4,600 schoolchildren from my electorate have come to this place, 225 volunteers and four ANIP interns have worked in my office and, on average, 15,000 constituents a year have sought help, support and advice from the Indi office. Community members, more than I possibly could count, have offered support and advice and have shared their wisdom, and I have grown in confidence and courage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning, after agreeing to stand as a candidate, I was so nervous, worried and anxious. Then we won by a magic 439 votes, and I was really nervous, worried and very anxious! But I was determined to deliver. I really did want to prove that my community had done a good thing and the right thing in backing me. It was deeply personal. There had been a fierce competition for me to get here and to stay here. It required enormous emotional courage, strategy, skill, and a huge community effort. The expectations were enormous and heavy, and I took the responsibility of truly representing my community very seriously. So I am so proud to stand here today and say we have survived the ordeal and have hopefully set a benchmark in the process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community has grown in confidence and courage, and we have delivered. I use that pronoun 'we' very deliberately. We have delivered confidence in democracy. We have delivered engagement in democracy. We've delivered better governance. We've delivered pride in community. And our voice has been heard. To the major parties, to my colleagues here, I have a short message: Independents do get things done. And every time any one of you says the opposite, the people of rural and regional Australia will remember these words: 'Tony, Independents deliver. Marginal seats matter. Just look at what happened in Indi. We have one-third of the vote. Let's use it.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today our community's more confident, and this is important for investment, for jobs and for regional growth. Confidence is important for our young people and our families who, in ever-increasing numbers, are making the decision to return home to north-east Victoria. Engagement across all levels of the community has grown, with more and more people stepping up to leadership positions. I'm delighted that the community, and especially our young people, are now more engaged. They are signing up, turning up, and speaking up in far greater numbers. This active participation in democracy is paying dividends in our community. Right across the electorate, things are also getting done and we have significant investment: over $235 million for the North East Rail Line; 52 mobile phone towers; numerous regional infrastructure projects; the regional deal for Albury-Wodonga; Wodonga Junction Plan; Tallangatta redevelopment; Wangaratta Aquatic Centre; Alpine landscapes; the controversial Wangaratta Hospital, $20 millionâand a special thank you goes to Dan Andrews and the Victorian government for coming to the party on that one; infrastructure jobs in Benalla; Mansfield Stadium; the heavy truck bypass; Kinglake Streetscape; Corryong Memorial Hall and Pool, and many, many more other things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But to my work in this place: the commitment I gave was to strive for good governance, and I think it is evidenced in the parliamentary work we have been involved in and which I mentioned briefly at the start of my speech. I'm particularly proud of the efforts in changing the rules for vulnerable witnesses and the rules governing gender dysphoria. Other highlights include the private member's legislation for the National Integrity Commission, and a code of conduct for all members of the parliament, recognising that our community expects more of us, its elected representatives. I was so proud to work with Griffith University, Transparency International Australia and the Accountability Round Table to introduce that legislation. A Senate committee is due to report on those bills tomorrow, and today in Melbourne, Transparency International released an assessment of Australia's national integrity systems. I call on all sides, everybody, to give the required resources to do this well. It's unfinished business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A private member's bill for an office for regional Australia made sense. Working with the member for Mayo for a minister for young people made sense. Representing my communities on refugees made sense. Giving my support for the refugee medivac bill was the right thing to doâbut it's unfinished business. I'm proud of the inquiry into regional development and decentralisation, and I note Senator McKenzie is in the House. I'm looking forward to that report, Senator. I am also proud of the inquiry into regional higher education, and I note that the minister for higher education is in the House. I'm looking forward to that report, Minister.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, the work is unfinished. On climate change, we haven't been able to do as much as we wanted in this space, but we did manage to save the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, and we did manage to save the Clean Energy Finance Corporationâthat infrastructure that was so important and was going to be done away with. But climate change and its mitigation remain serious issues in my electorate, and I know in Indi it's going to be a climate change election.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, there's a hierarchy! In my first speech, I committed to making a public statement in this place to recognise and acknowledge past mistreatment of our Indigenous community, and I'm proud to say that I did it in my first year, in my first term. I also committed to improving public transport infrastructure and access to telecommunications and health services and I worked to reduce the red tape that hinders the growth of business in our cross-border regions. There has been significant progress in all those areas. I committed to bringing the voices of the community of Indi to Canberra, and what greater example of success have we got than in the gallery today? I committed to a vision for a prosperous and caring community where businesses grow, agriculture flourishes and everyone can reach their potential. We have made great progress.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I turn my words to comments of acknowledgement, honouring and thanks. Clearly, words are inadequate for some things that we know are so deep and lasting. You know who you are and you know what you've done. To my colleagues in this parliament, members and your staff: I do appreciate the warmth of the welcome that you extended to me when I first arrived. It was beyond all expectations. I have received your friendship and professional support and I want to say thank you very, very much. Everybody in this House has added value to the work that we have done. I want to make a special mention of the many ministers, some here today, who have visited Indi. We have noticed and we appreciate it. Thank you. To all the other wonderful peopleâthe staff and the ones who make this place function, too many to nameâI want to say thank you for making our jobs here so much easier. I can't name you all, but you're there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now to my special friends on the crossbench: we have all worked togetherâlong nights, big daysâand together we've reflected the diversity of Australia. We've worked with great respect and generosity together. Talking to the crossbench and of the crossbench, I want to make a special call-out to the people of Australia to pay attention to these extraordinary people and the work done here. Thank you. Clearly, our work is not yet done. In giving you my blessing: may you grow and multiply; may you all win your seats with increased margins; and may you continue to be the voice of reason, the voice of the marginalised and the voice of the forgotten.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my staff past and present, many of whom are here today and, I have to say, looking resplendent: I acknowledge your dedication, your persistence, your tolerance, your loyalty, your tact, your diplomacy and your courage. You have been my and Indi's arms, legs, eyes, ears, heart and soul. We thank you very, very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this stage, can my family please raise their hands. To my family: it is a truism to say I need you and I'm better because of you. Thanks to each and every one of you for your personal support, the phone calls and the debriefs on the long drive home from Canberra after a huge week. Can the niblings raise their hands. I thank them for their special help and advice, particularly during the marriage equality debate. I really appreciated your wisdom. Thank you for turning up today, because I know you have travelled great distances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to the communities of Indi, those here today and those listening to the broadcast. You heard the call and you rallied. We could do better. A huge thank you to you. Your belief, your trust and your courage have made this crazy, brave experiment possible. Thank you so much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to the media. In particular, I would like to give a shout-out to the media of rural and regional Australia, particularly in my electorate of Indi. Without fail, you turned up. Those post-parliamentary Friday pressers in Wodonga have become such an important part of our routine. We had regular catch-ups, and your desire for accuracy continues to make Indi a much, much better place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now let me turn to the future. The community took a huge risk in voting for me not once but twice. However, today it feels less risky to vote for an Independent and more like a sane, sensible alternative for the one-third of the population who live outside the metropolitan areas and for those who live in metropolitan areas. I say to the people of Indi: we have called the government to account and we, all of us, need to continue to hold the next government to account. It is important that parliament join the dots on regional and rural Australia. Regional communities are ready to work with government and the government needs to take the time to listen to us. That's why, through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Regions at the Ready</span> report, I have been advocating for a new approach to regional policy, strategic planning and a strengthening regional Australia development network. We need a white paper on regional Australia, one that is developed with communities and with regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make a special shout-out now to the young people of regional Australia. It was the young people of my electorate who got me here. They nagged, they plodded and they harassed me. But they also saw the potential. They dragged me into the digital age of social media and they provided me with the constant inspiration to be my best self. I say to the young people of regional Australia, to the young people of Australia, on behalf of this parliament: we love you. We want you to be part of our democracy. We want you to be part of what we do here. And, sadly, you're not here in any way, shape or form in the numbers we need you. We know you've got wonderful lives. We know you do creative, innovative and amazing things. But we want to see you in government. My call to the young people of rural and regional Australia, of all Australia, is: don't get mad; get elected. For every organisation in Indi, I say: look at your leadership. Where are the young people? Are you passing on the baton?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking of getting elected, I extend an invitation post this speech to all of us to attend the launch of my sister Ruth's book. It's called <span style="font-style:italic;">Get Elected</span> and it is a step-by-step campaign guide to winning public office. It is at one o'clock at Queen's Terrace. It's a great gift to extended family and friends who complain. You can just say, 'Don't get mad; get electedâhere's the book!' There is a special discount for Indi people, I thinkâRuth, is that right?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, it is time for the succession plan to be implemented. I am really looking forward to Sunday when Helen Haines launches her campaign in Wodonga to be the new Independent candidate for Indi. I wish her well. Helen is a nurse. We love nurses. Helen is a midwife, and we know they deliver! Helen has a PhD in public health, and we know how much we need good input into public health. She is an exemplary candidate and I ask my colleagues here to extend to her the same warmth and collegiality you have given to me, assuming she wins. Helen is the change we want to see. Respectful, engaged and clear in her motivation, she is a community grassroots candidateâwe say we are different horses but from the same stable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now to the end. The single and most important lesson for me is that political and community engagement is to be part of a teamâit is to turn up, to sign up for a job and to speak up, to put your hand out to others and give them a leg up. In closing, I have run one leg of this relay, and the independent banner carries a precious legacy for our future. And I'm not going away; I'm merely taking a step back as I pass the baton on and allowing others to step forward. I leave you with this quote from the back of the toilet door at Mittagundi: 'The future is not some place we are going to but one we are creating. The paths to it are not found but made, and the making of these pathways changes both the maker and the destination.' Thank you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (Mutual Reforms) Bill 2019 amends the Corporations Act to enable mutual and cooperative firmsâin particular, mutually owned financial institutionsâto raise the capital they need to compete with investment owned banks, insurers and other competitors. Cooperatives, mutuals and member-owned firms have a proud history across the country of providing generations of Australians with customer and community focused alternatives to profit-driven business. The oldest member-owned firms even predate the Commonwealth, with some tracing histories that extend back to decades before Federation. Over 14 billion people, or nearly two in three Australians, were members of these organisations in 2017.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet despite their value to customers and the community, mutuals and cooperatives in Australia have long been underappreciated and ignored by our federal laws. They face a number of barriers preventing them from growing to their full potential, placing them at a disadvantage. Recognising that our federal laws were effectively forcing mutuals and cooperatives to compete with one arm tied behind them, in 2017 the then Treasurerânow Prime MinisterâScott Morrison commissioned Greg Hammond to advise the government on regulatory and legislative changes that could remove the barriers facing the sector. The government accepted all 11 of the Hammond report recommendations and we have been working with the mutuals, the legal community and regulators to develop the bill. The government has consulted with the Legislative and Governance Forum on Corporations in relation to the bill, which has approved them as required under the Corporations Agreement 2002. It is an immense credit to the Prime Minister, who, as Treasurer, pushed these reforms forward. Frankly, he deserves to be acknowledged as these reforms now come before the parliament.</span>

It will remove the uncertainty around demutualised provisions in disclosure requirements that have prevented mutual authorised deposit-taking institutions, otherwise known as mutual banks, from raising capital in the past. And it will create a new bespoke instrument called a 'mutual capital instrument', which allows mutuals to raise equity through a specialised capital instrument. The bill also provides a simple standardised process for mutuals to amend their constitutions to take advantage of the introduction of mutual capital instruments should they wish to do so.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this legislation the government will finally ensure that cooperatives and mutuals are recognised in our federal laws. Our reforms will mean more opportunities for mutual organisations by allowing them to raise the funds they need to make long-term investments for the benefit of their members and to compete effectively with shareholder owned companies to the benefit of all Australians. Full details are contained in the explanatory memorandum.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Mutual Reforms) Bill 2019. The idea of mutualism is vital to communities. Mutuals build trust and reciprocity. They are an essential part of an inclusive society helping to foster empathy for our fellow human beings. Cooperatives and mutuals, as member-owned enterprises, exist and operate in the same market as investor owned enterprises. They are voluntary associations of people, democratically run for their members, for the pursuit of a common social, cultural or economic goal. Eight out of 10 Australian adults are members of at least one cooperative or mutual. They account for some seven or eight per cent of GDP and 54,000 direct jobs. Mutuals such as HCF, Capricorn Society, ME Bank, Australian Unity, Sunsuper and roadside organisations, including the NRMA, the RACQ and the RACV, are cooperatives and mutuals that are essential to Australian society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mutualism is also well placed to play a role in the digital economy. Internationally we have driver owned apps competing with Uber and Lyft. Coopify is an app connecting a childcare cooperative with clients in New York. Stocksy sells stock photographs supplied by its members online. In my own electorate of Fenner I have seen firsthand the benefits of the cooperative sector, with the National Health Co-op now expanding from its original location in Charnwood to set up more than half a dozen locations across Canberra and rural New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill. And why wouldn't we? This is a Labor idea. This is a bill enacting Labor policy and we are delighted to see it finally coming to the House. The bill amends the Corporations Act in relation to mutual entities such as customer owned banks and credit unions and customer owned insurance service providers. They were originally announced as Labor policy in November 2016 in a speech I gave at Old Parliament House announcing Labor's Inclusive Ownership, Inclusive Growth package. That was a policy that drew heavily from Labor senator Chris Ketter's Senate Economics Committee inquiry. I pay particular tribute to Senator Ketter for his work in shaping Labor's cooperatives and mutuals agenda. In 2016 the government launched the Hammond review and eventually agreed to its recommendations in 2017. It took the coalition a full 12 months to adopt Labor's reforms and then another 12 months to draft the required legislation. But we are here now and Labor is very pleased to have gotten to this point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces a definition of a mutual entity into the Corporations Act. It removes the uncertainty for transferring financial institutions and friendly societies in respect of the demutualisation provisions in part 5 of schedule 4 of the Corporations Act and it expressly permits mutual entities registered under the Corporations Act to issue equity capital without risking their mutual structure or status.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many stakeholders supporting the bill, but one to whom I want to pay particular tribute is the Business Council of Cooperatives and Mutuals CEO, Melina Morrison. She has been a driving force behind the creation of the Parliamentary Friends of Mutuals and Co-operatives, co-chaired by myself and Senator McKenzie. The Customer Owned Banking Association has been a strong advocate for this reform, and their work has been important, too, in shaping Labor's policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's cooperatives and mutual reforms promote ethical competition and productivity. They encourage social investment and the wellbeing of workers and small businesses. Since we first announced the reform that is in today's bill as Labor policy at the end of 2016, the coalition cycled through multiple prime ministers, multiple treasurers and multiple assistant ministers, but there has been one unchanging fact, which is Labor's support for the cooperatives and mutuals sector. If only the coalition had been as cooperative as the sector, we perhaps could have done this quicker, but we are here now. It has only taken us 2Â½ years to get here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this isn't the end of what we need to do to assist cooperatives and mutuals playing a bigger role in the Australian economy. As I said before, they account for seven per cent to eight per cent of GDP. We believe they could account for even more, with their important role of shaking up sectors, providing strong ethical leadership and ensuring that there are customer-owned alternatives to investor-owned business models. One such reform would be to ensure that cooperatives and mutuals have equal access to government grants, particularly under the Indigenous Advancement Strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is particularly apposite that we are debating this legislation just a couple of months after the royal commission into the banking sector came down. Labor called for that royal commission in 2016, some months before we announced our cooperatives and mutuals policy. At the time, the member for Cook said that the royal commission was just a 'populist whinge'. The government in announcing the royal commission only did so after the big four banks had called for a royal commission. The member for Cook said it was regrettable that we had to have a royal commission into the banks. But no-one now looking at Commissioner Hayne's report would argue that was a regrettable report. I think there is broad recognition in the finance sector that this was the royal commission we had to have. We've seen the chair and the CEO of AMP step down. We have seen a range of referrals to the Director of Public Prosecutions. We have seen scandals involving fees paid for advice not received and fees charged to dead people. We have seen allegations of envelopes stuffed with money, of breaches of AUSTRAC notification procedures and of collusion to fix the bank bill swap rate. The royal commission has seen a litany of scandals and has again reinforced the simple fact that, when it comes to ethical competition within the economy, there is only one side of this parliament, Labor, that makes the right calls.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Customer Owned Banking Association has made a strong argument for the role of cooperatives and mutuals in providing real competition in the banking sector. So one of the important things that we get from this bill is additional competition in a sector which is highly concentrated, even by global standards. It's important that we have a strong banking sector but it's also important that we have a competitive one, because it's that competition between our banks that places downward pressure on the margins and ensures that Australians get proper choice when they're taking out a mortgage or looking to get a good return on their savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With customer owned banks, there is an alternative to the investor owned opportunities which, again, have a long tradition in economics. The cooperatives and mutual sector is a sector which harks back to the words of one of the founders of economics Adam Smith, who said, 'Man naturally desires, not only to be loved, but to be lovely; or to be that thing which is the natural and proper object of love.' When you speak to people in the cooperatives and mutual sector, those words of Adam Smith's, written more than two centuries ago, resonate with them as well. The choice is not between economy and society, as Margaret Thatcher so falsely posited. It is possible to have organisations operating ethically within our economy. Indeed, free markets depend on trust, morality and decency. It is the role of mutualism which can ensure that the best spirits of Smith are able to be found in our economy. This notion from the theory of moral sentiments is absolutely critical to the reforms that we're advocating today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows that these reforms will promote ethical competition and productivity, and that they'll encourage social investment and the wellbeing of workers and small businesses. It is Labor's advocacy for this sector which has brought these reforms to the House today.</span>

                    </a>  It is Labor's advocacy which has ensured we are here today. I hear the Assistant Treasurer interject, 'No, it's not.' Well, we simply have to look at the range of reforms that have been led by Labor during this term of parliament. We had, just back in February, the example of Labor's laws on access to justice, which were introduced by Labor into the Senate, passed the Senate on the voices when the coalition decided that they were going to lose the vote on the floor and then were passed through the Houseâanother Labor reform passed through this parliament. This reform today would not be being debated were it not for Labor's strong advocacy and for the catch-up politics in which the coalition are engaged.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hammond review simply ensured that the ideas in the Ketter review were brought to this parliament.

                    </a>  It's extraordinary to hear the Minister for Energy, the Don Quixote of the parliament, when he's not out tilting at windmills, arguing that Labor is not the party for competition. Labor is the party of competition and will remain the party of competition. Labor is going to the next election advocating that we should give more resources to the ACCC, that we should do postmerger reviews and that we should ban unfair contract terms. But, when it comes to the big stick, this is a policy which the minister has been forced to abandon. He has had to take his big stick and stick it under the table, because his big stick is so unloved anywhere he attempts to bring it out.</span>

                    </a>  I'll take that interjection, Minister. The fact is that, if there is one party that supports crony capitalism, it's the party on the other side. That is why neither a single serious economist nor a single serious business leader supports the idea of divestiture powers in a single sector. Of course, some countries have divestiture powers, and we'll periodically have debates over this, but the notion that you would have divestiture powers in a single sector is utter anathema to serious economics.</span>

The minister has no credibility when it comes to arguing for competition.

This bill demonstrates the government's support for cooperatives, mutuals and member owned firms by enabling these institutions to raise the funds they need to grow and compete. The sector is diverse and represents an alternative model for delivering important customer and community focused services across many industries, including agriculture, banking, finance, housing, insurance and retail. The government is committed to removing the impediments facing the mutual sector, and this bill delivers on that commitment. These changes will not only result in better outcomes for members of cooperatives and mutuals but also improve the capacity of member owned firms to innovate, grow and compete, delivering better outcomes for all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill is to protect sponsorship and licensing revenue from the International Cricket Council T20 World Cup, to be held in 2020, from being undermined by ambush marketing, which is the unauthorised commercial use of event indiciaâor expressionsâand images. This will be achieved by including the T20 World Cup as a recognised major sporting event under the Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Act. The bill also takes the opportunity to remove schedules relating to historical sporting events that are no longer providing protections under the act, being the Asian Football Confederation Asian Cup of 2015 and the ICC Cricket World Cup of 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is consistent with the approach the Australian government took when it legislated to protect the indicia and images of the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games, the Asian Football Confederation Asian Cup of 2015, the ICC World Cup in 2015, the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games and the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. It also meets a commitment by the Australian government to provide such intellectual property rights protection for the T20 World Cup.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hosting the T20 World Cup in Australia provides a unique opportunity to showcase our country to the world from a tourism, trade and event-delivery perspective. Event owners and organisers like those for the T20 World Cup rely heavily on revenue generated by television rights, ticket sales, sponsorship and licensing to ensure their event can be delivered and continues to be an attractive and viable financial proposition to future host countries. It's this profile and these commercial realities that necessitate the sorts of protections that are proposed for the T20 World Cup in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will protect the use of a range of expressions and images associated with the T20 World Cup with the aim to prevent an unauthorised user from applying those indicia and images to suggest a formal association with the T20 World Cup. The act, known as 'ambush marketing by association', has the capacity to diminish the value of sponsorship, reduce the incentive for organisations to enter into commercial arrangements with events, and reduce the overall event revenue. In turn, this has the ability to increase the financial impact on government to support such events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it's important to protect the T20 World Cup sponsors from ambush marketing, the rights of the community to freedom of expression must also be respected, particularly in relation to words that have passed into common usage. A pragmatic approach has been taken, with generic words and references excluded from the list of protected expressions. In line with the Australian government's deregulation agenda, the bill is not intended to increase the burden on businesses or affect their everyday operations. The bill fully protects the rights of the existing holders to use T20 World Cup indicia and images to carry out their business functions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The T20 World Cup schedule proposed in the bill will cease to have effect after 30 November 2021, approximately one year after the completion of the event. This is consistent with other major sporting events protected by the act. I thank the members for their contributions to the debate on this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  I take this opportunity to speak on the Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill 2018. Can I say from the outset that I'm somewhat surprised that it has taken this long to get this legislation into the House, given that there is some urgency to it. We have to have the legislation in place and then, in turn, rely on many of the state governments to enact complementary legislation to achieve the objectives of the bill. Given that the legislation was first brought into the Senate, I believe, in December 2018, I would have thought that the legislation would be before us a little earlier. Nevertheless, here we are, on possibly the very last day of sitting of this parliament, dealing with this legislation. It's important that we get it through the House today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill, which, as the Minister for Energy said a moment ago, amends the Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 2014. That act is out of date and refers to past events; therefore, if we want the act to be relevant to future events, it has to be appropriately amended. This amendment bill updates the act so that it refers to upcoming major sporting events; specifically, the International Cricket Council T20 World Cup cricket tournament, which includes both the men's and the women's tournaments. It's to be held in Australia in 2020. The amendments in the bill will make the ICC T20 World Cup 2020 a major sporting event under the act. They also insert information required to protect related intellectual property, such as the event's name, logo, branding and similar things. Furthermore, the amendments set the period of protectionâagain, as the minister said a moment agoâto end on 30 November 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The protections provided by these amendments are standard and necessary for major sporting events hosted in Australia and mirror protections provided under the act for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 and the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games only last year. The ICC T20 World Cup 2020 Local Organising Committee hopes this bill can pass the parliament as soon as possible. As I said at the outset, that's because we want to ensure the amendments to the act become effective at least one year prior to the ICC Women's T20 World Cup, which will be held in February and March of next year. That, effectively, is just under a year away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands that these protections will be complemented by equivalent protections against ambush marketingâwhich the minister alluded to in his opening remarksâthat will be introduced by the governments of states and territories that will be hosting the matches in the year 2020. It's important for those pieces of legislation also to go through the parliaments of the state jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">National and international sport is big business. It generates big dollars for a lot of entities. However, it is costly to stage, and sponsors rely on exclusive rights to the use of logos and images for the products which they then market in order to recoup their sponsorship costs. Those rights need to be protected, and they need to be protected by law. That is the purpose of this billâto endeavour to do that. I'm aware that in past events where there have been products sold and logos used there have been those who have sought to capitalise on those products by providing counterfeit products. Having legislation such as this provides certainty to the organisers and sponsors and, in turn, ensures that the event will proceed. Of course, if the event proceeds then that is good for Australia's cricket fansâin this caseâwho have the opportunity to see the world's best cricketers in action here in Australia. It's also good for Australia, because the Australian economy will benefit from both the tourism generated and the turnover of products that are made and sold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">International events provide the rest of the world with exposure to Australia, through the television screening of those events, and that in itself is one of the best ways we can promote Australia as a tourism destination. I'm aware that, through many such events, tourism to Australia has increased. Earlier this year we had, as we have now had for many years, the Tour Down Under in South Australia. It's considered an international event. It not only brings people into Australiaâand into South Australia in particularâfrom around the world; over the week of the tournament it also is televised in so many countries across the world, which in turn provides South Australia with a wonderful opportunity to promote itself on the world stage. And, indeed, we have much in Australia to promote. So, whilst we have our tourism industry doing that each and every day, I see international sporting events as one of the ways of doing that in an indirect but very effective manner.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a sporting nation, and I think the fact that Australia is a sporting nation is one of our strengths. Over the years we have not only produced some of the best sportspeople in the world in this country; more importantly, this has also done two things that I just want to briefly touch on. International sports provide inspiration and opportunity for young people in this country in a way that few other things do. Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, from your own work as a member of parliament, you would be aware of the sporting people in your community and the grants that are provided to them to enable them to compete in state, national and international events. It is through those grants that I see so many young people having the opportunity to pursue something that they want to do. In many cases, I have seen young people from my own community going the whole way and ending up representing Australia. I believe that that all starts when those young people get to see an international event in progress. They, too, can dream of one day being the person out there on the field playing the sport. Continuing to support our children through those grants and also providing them with the opportunity to see the best in the world in front of them is, I think, one of the most inspiring things we can do for them. For many of them, that would not be possible if the events were not held here in Australia, and that would not be possible if the promoters and organisers of those events were not protected through legislation such as this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other matter that I want to address is particularly relevant, given what happened in New Zealand in recent times. It is that sport in this country has brought people together in a way that nothing else has. I have seen people come together on the sporting field and support one another regardless of their race, their colour, their nationality or their religion, even when they are playing on opposing teams. I believe it has been one of the terrific ways that the barriers for people in this country have broken down. It's a prime example of why it makes sense to support our sporting communities out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate I regularly visit sporting communities and sporting events of all persuasions. I'm sure that my electorate simply reflects what is happening right around the country. There is a terrific effort being made by all the volunteers, supporters and parents who make all of that possible. Quite often they do so week in, week out on a purely voluntary basis with very little financial support from anywhere else. I'll be attending a sporting presentation this coming Saturday night for a local cricket team, as I will be in two weeks time for another cricket team. That just highlights the importance of sports within our community. It also highlights, in my mind, that cricket, which this particular legislation is focusing on, is one of the sports that, in this country, has now become a national sport. In our summer months particularly, I rarely go anywhere without seeing a TV screen showing international cricketâor I am at a cricket match myself. Cricket and Australian Rules football are, respectively, perhaps the two most dominant sports in winter and summer. This country can be proud of what it has managed to do because of its support for those sports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing I want to mention is that on the weekend just passed the Australian national women's football league, the AFL Women's, played its grand final in Adelaide. The match was between the women's Crows team and the women's Carlton team. The Crows won, and I take this opportunity to congratulate them, and in particular the captain, Erin Phillips, who led the side and has been a magnificent player for them throughout. Unfortunately, Erin was injured in the game, but nevertheless was able to come back at the end of the game to at least acknowledge the win. I congratulate not only the women's Crows team for their splendid effort on Sunday but also Erin for her leadership of the team. My commiserations to Carlton, who I believe put up a really good effort in competing on the day, but obviously only one team can win. The last thing I will say about that game is this: women's football has sometimes not been supported in the same way as men's football, and it's suggested that women's football is perhaps not of a standard equivalent to men's football. Anyone who believes that ought to go along to watch a women's league game. It was a spectacular game. To the people around Australia I say this also: it was wonderful to see Adelaide Oval absolutely full to the brim with followers and spectators. I think it surprised most people that we would get a capacity crowd, but we did. I think that is testament to the quality of the football being played and also, again, to the sporting culture we have in this country, which is something that I'm proud of and something that we should try to protect for as long as we can, because I think it is one of the great assets of Australian life.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  I congratulate the member for Makin and wholly concur with his comments regarding women's AFL. It's a fantastic sportâvery competitiveâand it is wonderful to see the athleticism and talent of so many young women throughout Australia. It is now being mirrored in the great sport of rugby league, as well, which is fantastic to see. Australians love their sport. We love playing sport, we love watching sport and we love reliving it often. The Monday morning coach stories about how a team fared on the weekendâwhat went wrong, how you would have done betterâare folklore in Australian workplaces and homes throughout the country. Increasingly, like all aspects of society, with social media and new digital platforms developing we're seeing more and more chances for images and photographs of people participating in sport to spread throughout not only the internet but other platforms as well. We have a recent example of this with the controversyâhighly unwarrantedâthat was created in respect of the image of Tayla Harris kicking that fantastic goal during the AFLW season. What a photograph! It captured one of Australian sport's most iconic moments. It was a tribute to her and her teammates' athleticism, a tribute to the AFL and to that particular sport and to the promotion of women's involvement in sport. We all know, unfortunately, the controversy that surrounded it. But I think the important thing to remember is that, at the end of the day, Channel 7 put that photo back up on their website because of the public reactionâbecause of the reaction of the Australian people about their love for that image and all that it portrayed about women's sport and athleticism. It highlights the importance of ensuring that we're protecting major sporting events' indicia and images, including certain photographs, in the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill 2018 amends the Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 2014. This act is out of date and refers to past events, so this is really about updating that particular act. This amendment bill updates the act so that it refers to upcoming major sporting events, specifically the ICC T20 World Cup 2020 cricket tournament, comprising both the men's and the women's tournaments, to be held in Australia in 2020. The amendments make the ICC T20 World Cup a major sporting event under the act, insert information required to protect related intellectual property such as the event's name, the logo, the branding and similar things, and set the period of protection. The protections provided by these amendments are standard and necessary for major sporting events hosted in Australia and mirror the major protections provided under the act for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 and the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games last year, both of which were sensational sporting events. They brought a lot of tourism and benefit for the Australian economy and Australian society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ICC T20 World Cup 2020 Local Organising Committee hopes that this bill can pass the parliament as soon as possible to ensure the amendments to the act become effective at least one year prior to the women's T20 World Cup, which will be held from February next year. Labor understands that these protections will be complemented by equivalent protections against ambush marketing, to be introduced by the governments of various states and territories that will be hosting the matches in 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a reform that is required. It's certainly something that the industry has requested. It's good to see that the government has acted on this. Labor certainly supports this reform. I'm sure that, when these events are held in Australia, we're going to see, both in the men's and the women's categories, some exceptional sporting achievements, and it's appropriate that the images, logos and indicia that are associated with these sporting events are protected, and that is what this bill will do.</span>

We're talking about the Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill 2018, which has, as the member for Makin pointed out, been brought into the chamber at the last minute. I feel it is important to note the tardiness of putting this bill in place, with the extrapolated risks for the international event, the ICC T20 World Cup cricket tournament, to be held in Australia in 2020. Obviously, getting the bill passed today is fairly important to ensure that the indicia and images are protected during this event. There are 12 months leading up to this event, which is why this bill's before us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I concur with the member for Kingsford Smith and the member for Makin on the importance of sport in Australian cultureâthe pleasure and joy it brings to us, and also the way it builds into us our competitive nature, our push to want to be the best that we can be in all aspects of life, which is often learned on our local sporting fields or courts around the nation when we are very young children. We need to note that Australia has been successful in bringing the ICC T20 World Cup to Australia for 2020 and celebrate the fact that this is now a major international event that includes not just men's cricket but, of course, women's cricket. I want to give a big shout-out to Meg Lanning, the current Australian captain. Hopefully, Meg will be fit and firing and leading the Australian T20 team.</span>

                    </a>  As the member for Bruce outlined, we were doing some research here on the word 'indicia'. As a former English teacher I found it a shock that I had never seen this word before. For those listening at home, in one section of a definition we found that it was a formal singular noun and in another section we found that it was a formal plural nounâwhich of course fascinated us both. For those playing along at home, it means signs, indications or distinguishing marks, and therefore requires images to be attached, because it is also, obviously, about logos, branding and those sorts of things.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that the legislation is before us today is to ensure that 12 months out from an event the event can give a guarantee to those private businesses that might be joining the entity in promoting the event and in attracting large crowdsâwhich shouldn't be difficult in Australia. I do hope, as the member for Bruce said in his intervention, that we get some great-quality images used under the protection of this bill of female sporting heroes. I would hope that we can get some fabulous images of Australian female cricketers in their most recent successes. They are, of course, the pride of Australian cricket at the moment, and I'm sure the International Cricket Council would agree with me that it would probably be appropriate to ensure that images of some women holding up a bat or making that lunging stride and sliding that bat in to make an extra run would be important to share.</span>

I would hope that, if given the opportunity of government, a Labor government into the future would ensure that the legislation required for the Matildas FIFA Women's World Cup soccer, which we are hoping to attract to the country in 2022, and the Netball World Cup, which we are hoping to attract to Australia in 2027, will have the legislation passed in a more timely manner to ensure that images of our great female athletes in this country and around the world can be protected under legislation of this kind.</span>

We want to ensure that the tournament attracts the kind of investment that it requires. We want to ensure that we get a top-quality event happening in Australia to further enhance our reputation worldwide as being the sporting capital of the world. That reputation is broadening from sport to sport but, most importantly, that reputation is now going around the world and is not just limited to men's sport but includes women's team sports as well, which is also so critical.

I was fortunate enough to be at the Werribee Football Club Avalon oval to watch the Adelaide Crows women's team play North Melbourne in the conference rounds, and to be up close and personal to those girls playing our great game of football was amazingâto see the progression over two years, in terms of the talent, the play and the speed at which they moved the ball was incredibly impressive.

As a woman who lives with four blokesâthree sons and a partnerâit was terrific to be in my lounge room surrounded by female commentators, commentating both sports, and watching women, our elite athletes, at their very, very best, in intense competition for balls of both shapes. We had the round ball happening, obviously, on the netball court, and of course we had the oval ball being chased around Adelaide Oval.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I look forward to the T20 World Cup. I can't promise I'll watch any of the men's cricket in that tournament, but I'll be glued to my television set, or watching live somewhere around the country, watching our great Australian women's cricketers compete on the world stage. Of course, Australia will be hoping that we'll take out both crowns, as is our usual predictionâwe always predict we're going to win. We push our teams into a corner so that they have to deliver on our wish. And hopefully the T20 2020 major sporting event, as it will be now known under the act, will see Australia successful again.</span>

As someone who grew up playing sport, a lot of it at Baker Park in Wyong, I'm very pleased to speak on this today, as a netballer and as someone who knows what grassroots sport really means to local communities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm so pleased to be the patron of the Wyong District Netball Association. The association will have their march-past this Saturday. The march-past is the annual event where all of the clubs in the Wyong District Netball Association come together to launch our season. I'm very pleased, as patron, to be able to be joining that event on Saturday.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of regional sport, I would also like to mention the Central Coast Heart. The Central Coast Heart are the only regional netball team in the Netball New South Wales Premier League. The Netball New South Wales Premier League is a very competitive competition, and it's a pathway for our athletes to be able to then compete at elite levels of netball, nationally and hopefully internationally. I'm pleased to let the House know that the Central Coast Heart last year won the Netball New South Wales Premier League, and our captain, Amy Wild, was announced player of the series, and one of our coaches, Amber, is now a coach at a New South Wales level. I think what this demonstrates is that, if we have pathways to sports in regional communities, we have the opportunity for young women to be able to go on to represent us at a state, national and international level.</span>

The purpose of the Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill 2018 is to protect sponsorship and licensing revenue from the International Cricket Council T20 World Cup 2020 from being undermined and ambushed in its marketing campaign. The T20 World Cup will be recognised as a major sporting event under the Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 2014. I thank all members for their contributions to the debate on this bill.</span>

I'm pleased that the Senate has agreed to the amendments that were put forward and that the government has agreed as well.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is encouraging to see the government exhibit some acknowledgement that there are serious concerns to be had about this card. There simply is no evidence that this card works, and the government botched its own assessment of the card. We know that in many instances participants are unable to purchase essential items at more affordable prices. Labor's amendments will mitigate the arbitrary impacts that this card has on participants. Why should someone who can demonstrate responsible management of their finances be subjected to this card? Why should someone making an effort to look for a job to get back into the workforce be subjected to this card? Why should someone at risk of homelessness be subjected to this card? Children should be protected from the impacts of this card, too. Labor's amendments provide an opportunity to opt out for people who do the right thing or are vulnerable to the impacts of the card.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Income Management and Cashless Welfare) Bill 2019, which has been amended and returned from the Senate. We saw in the Senate last night the government accept Labor's amendments to let people get off this card. They have finally admitted that the way they have rolled out the bill is unfair and unreasonable. Labor have consistently expressed serious concerns about the cashless debit card, and we have consistently opposed its rollout nationally. It's encouraging to see the government recognise that there are serious concerns to be had about the card. There is simply no evidence that this card works, and the government has botched its own assessment of the card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in many instances participants are unable to purchase essential items at more affordable prices. Labor's amendments will mitigate the arbitrary impacts that this card has on participants. Why should someone who can demonstrate responsible management of finances be subjected to this card? Why should someone who is making an effort to look for a job, to seek work and to get back into the workforce be subjected to this card? As it has been rolled out, it is unreasonable and unfair. Why should someone who is at risk of homelessnessâvulnerable peopleâbe put in this precarious situation? Children should also be protected from the impacts of this card. Labor's amendments provide an opportunity for people who do the right thing or people vulnerable to the impacts of this card to opt out. As we have reiterated time and time again, Labor has serious concerns about the impact of this card. This bill, as amended, both mitigates against those impacts and ensures continuity of support for these communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking forward, as I've mentioned, Labor has never supported the rollout of the cashless debit card nationally, and now the government has finally recognised that there are serious problems with the rollout, serious problems with the way it has been implemented and serious problems with the evaluation. Labor does not support the expansion of the cashless debit card and this form of income management to new communities unless the community wants the card and there is informed community consent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the chance to speak about this when the bill came to the House earlier. As I said at the time, we don't believe in a blanket approach to income management. We do not support the rollout of a national cashless debit card. We believe that most recipients of income support are more than capable of managing their own finances. Labor has said all along that we will talk to individual communities and make decisions on a location-by-location basis. I am pleased to see that the amendments that the member for Barton has put have been accepted by the government. There are so many flaws in this unreasonable and unfair rollout. There are so many vulnerable individuals and communities that are unfairly impacted by this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hopefully, what we will see in the future is a much more reasonable and fair approach as most recipients of income support are more than capable of managing their own finances and more than capable of making decisions on behalf of their household and on behalf of their communities. What we need to see is proper consultation. What we need to see is an evidence based approach that works in the interests of people living within those communities. What we really need to see is community controlâthat any decisions are community led. I come from a background in health and mental health. I come from an area where there are many people within our Indigenous community who are making great strides forward, particularly in Aboriginal community-controlled health. There are excellent examples in my community and elsewhere across Australia where we have seen evidence-based, community-controlled, community-led approaches, and I think that's what we need to see.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Barton for putting these amendments, and I look forward to them being accepted by the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has one of the best health systems in the world; however, it's under intense pressure from an ageing population, increasing chronic disease, spiralling health costs, technological changes and rising consumer expectations. It is critical for the Australian government to tackle these pressures head on by reforming key parts of the system to build a long-term national health plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Essential to the success of a long-term health plan is ensuring Australians have the health workforce to deliver it: the right people with the right mix of skills providing quality services at the right time right around the country. The 2018-19 federal budget commits $550 million to the government's Stronger Rural Health Strategy. This strategy will help improve the health of people living in regional, rural and remote Australia through better training, recruitment and retention of the health workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Health Insurance Amendment (Bonded Medical Programs Reform) Bill 2019 is one of the targeted strategic responses under the Stronger Rural Health Strategy which responds to national challenge of ensuring primary health care is accessible and available to all Australians no matter where they live. Under the strategy a total of $20.2 million was committed to reform the bonded medical program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bonded medical programs are long-term investments in the health workforce by the Australian government. These programs were introduced back in 2001 as the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme and was expanded to include the Bonded Medical Places Scheme in 2004. These schemes are designed to address the doctor shortages across regional and remote Australia and in areas with workforce shortages. Participants receive a place in a medical course at an Australian university in return for commitment to work in unserviced areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This commitment to work in unserviced areas is referred to as return-of-service obligation, known as ROSO. Under current agreements the ROSO can be as much as six years of continuous service in a regional and rural/remote area and in areas with a workforce shortage after obtaining qualifications as a specialist medical practitioner. Each year, government provides up to 850 bonded Commonwealth support places in Australiaâmedical courses. As the program matures, increasing numbers of doctors are due to commence their return of service. Up to 700 doctors are expected to commence their return of service each year over the next five to seven years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today a total of 10,062 participants are actively participating in the bonded medical program, 9,452 participants are completing their medical degree or training and a further 610 are undertaking their ROSO by working in regional and remote locations, including areas of workforce shortage. It can take up to 22 years for a bonded doctor from a first-year medical student to complete their obligation to the Australian public under the bonded medical program. I commend and acknowledge the significant impact this value sector of the medical workforce is starting to have on reducing the gaps in medical services outside metropolitan areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is part of a broader reform to the bonded medical programs. Reforms will create a modern, flexible administrative system with greater capacity for the programs to support and target voluntary, recognised, Australian-trained doctors to work and stay in regional and rural/remote areas of Australia. It will enable participants to enter, if not already, an existing participant to opt into a statutory scheme without the need for individuals to contract. It will make it easier, significantly, for the bonded doctors to complete their ROSO by reducing and streamlining administrative requirements, giving more options as to when, where and how ROSO can be completed and providing earlier and stronger links with professional support agencies for doctors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These improvements will encourage doctors to stay working in places where they are undertaking their return-of-service obligations beyond their obligations. These improvements will help ensure more fully qualified Australian trained doctors work in regional, rural and remote Australia in areas of workforce shortage. More importantly, the reforms will also better target future bonded workforce locations of need as demographic and workforce demands change over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces a statutory scheme known as the bonded medical program to come into effect as of 1 January 2020. The statutory regulation scheme consolidates the existing BMP and the MRBS schemes under a single legislative framework to progress government's long-term view to move towards a single bonded medical scheme. The statutory scheme is clearer about the conditions of sanctions applied under the program, including the application for a medical ban for breaches of conditions under the MRBS scheme. Participants of the statutory scheme continue to have the right of an internal review and they'll be able to seek review for administrative decisions through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 January 2020 new participants will enter the program under a new statutory scheme and existing participants will be able to opt in. Existing administrative arrangements are significantly onerous and outdated, with the different contractual provisions both within and across existing schemes. Contractual agreements are complex and unwieldy to administer and are unable to be modernised efficiently and effectively to ensure the program responds to the government's future workforce needs and offers modern and flexible arrangements that are needed to support the future rural medical workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The statutory arrangements will eventually replace the myriad and complex contractual arrangements currently in place with individual participants. Statutory provisions will ensure that existing participants and future participants will have access to the same suite of options and opportunities moving forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Managing obligations over the 20-year period can be frustrating at times and resource intensive. The statutory scheme will enable participants to flexibly self-manage these obligations through a program-specific web portal and phone application. Participants, no matter where they are, will be able to log on and update their information and be able to plan, track and record their ROSO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The statutory scheme will enable collection of data for reporting and effective evaluation of programs. At this stage, it is too early to evaluate the program's success; however, it is critical that government and medical professionals in the Australian public have access to robust evaluation of the program outcomes to inform policy decisions into the future. It is the government's long-term view to rationalise the bonded medical program to a single bonded medical scheme once all the existing schemes have expired. It is envisaged that this will occur in around 2035 when all participants under the existing scheme have either completed their obligations under that program or have chosen to opt into the new statutory scheme. The government is committed to implementing progressive and responsive administrative arrangements which support both current and future bonded doctors keen to make substantial contributions to better access medical services across Australia.</span>

The site employs countless local Macarthur residents and this decision will result in over 220 job losses at the site. Many workers had worked there for decades since its opening in 1988. This is devastating to my community and devastating to the countless local Macarthur families who will now be left in limbo as a result of this terrible decision. There will be 220 jobs lost as a result of Kimberly-Clark shifting their operations to Asia. I cannot even begin to imagine the hurt and anger that so many Macarthur families are feeling as a result of this decision.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  It's with great disappointment that I rise to join with the member for Macarthur to advise the House of the closure of the Ingleburn mill, as it is a dreadful loss for the manufacturing industry in Australia. On Tuesday night, the Treasurer had the gall to stand in this place and claim the economy was working for everyday Australians. I would like to see him say that to the 220 workers who have just lost their jobs on this government's watch. Yesterday the textiles manufacturer Kimberly-Clark laid off its entire Western Sydney workforce. Their jobs will go to overseas workers in Asia. In just 12 weeks these 220 workers will no longer have jobs to go to, no longer have the security, stability and satisfaction of a hard day's work. We are seeing another example, under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, of hundreds of Australians losing secure, decent jobs. I stand with the CFMMEU when they say that this is a devastating blow for workers across Australia. How will Australian mums and dads know that essential products like nappies are made to Australian safety standards when these jobs are marching offshore on the government's watch?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will look forward to meeting with representatives from Kimberly-Clark next week to discuss the decision. In the meantime, my thoughts are with the Kimberly-Clark employees and their families who have given so much to this company.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  I rise to acknowledge and thank the outgoing Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Graham Quirk, for 34 years of great service to our city of Brisbane. Graham Quirk was one of the first elected representatives I ever met and he's proven himself over decades to be one of the best retail politicians right across Australia. He recorded huge popular votes across Brisbane, averaging 59 per cent and 68 per cent of the two-party vote for him as lord mayor, and his administration swept the board twice, winning 18 of 26 wards in 2012 and then 19 in 2016. His greatest legacies as Lord Mayor will include his stewardship and custodianship of Brisbane as it became a larger, more global and more confident city, as well as the landmark infrastructure projects that he's delivered, like the Legacy Way tunnel, the Kingsford Smith Drive upgrade and construction of Howard Smith Wharves and the fruits of the recent city deal agreement for South-East Queensland.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Working closely with Lord Mayor Graham Quirk on the now fully funded Brisbane Metro project has been a highlight of my time in office so far. It's a project that will revolutionise the city's public transport offering and truly change the face of our great city. I want to give Graham and his wife, Anne, and his family my very best wishes for the future and their next adventures. Thank you, Lord Mayor, for your service to the people of Brisbane.</span>

We were at an AMWU dinner the other night and we heard from Troy Carter and Steve about the many other people who have been on this picket line who were basically sacked and then offered their jobs back with a 30 per cent pay cut and a cruel antifamily roster. We have workers who are keen to get in there and do their jobs, but, obviously, with those sorts of conditions, there's no way that any decent Australian could accept such a turnaround. We heard from Troy Carter at the dinner about what it's like to be on that picket line, to be trying to make sure that you have enough food on the table for your family while profits are going to the top end of town.</span>

For too long, for over a year, these families in Longford, Victoria have been suffering because of this short-sighted approach to industrial relations. We believe in an Australia that is fair, an Australia that is egalitarian. I'd ask the company to take a kinder heart to Troy Carter, Steve and all those who are on that picket line.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I rise this afternoon to highlight a success story in my electorate. The Cairns Airport recently topped the on-time performance for all airports across Australia and New Zealand. They have also ranked globally amongst small airports with an on-time performance of 83.7 per cent. Cairns Airport CEO, Norris Carter, was asked at the time what the secret to the airport's success was and he said, 'This extraordinary achievement is only possible thanks to the dedication and commitment of our entire airport community.' No truer words have been spoken. The entire Far North Queensland community is extremely proud of our airport and the critical role it plays. It is the heartbeat of our local economy. The Cairns Airport is currently undergoing a $55 million domestic terminal upgrade that will significantly improve the customers' experience. The 10,000 square metre expansion will see the departures hall receiving additional seating and an improved layout, simplifying navigation of the terminal for passengers. An additional 2,000 square metres for dining and retail options will also be devoted to showcasing the best of tropical North Queensland to the world. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank the management and the staff of the airport for the wonderful work that they do on a daily basis and to congratulate CEO Norris Carter on a job well done in connecting Far North Queenslanders to Australia and the world. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As the member for Moreton said previously, he and I sat with a couple members of the metalworkers' union recently and heard about this Esso dispute. For more than 652 daysâin fact, 652 days, 12 hours and 31 minutesâthese workers have been on a picket line. They had a new enterprise agreement, signed by five people who weren't offshore workers at that time, which has now bound up these members on the picket line. They have had their agreement slashed by 30 per cent, annual leave reduced and conditions reduced. Let's call it out for what it is: this is a sham contract.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government doesn't just stop at supporting sham contracting. Let's talk about penalty rates: 11,000 people in the Moreton Bay region had their penalty rates cut. What about labour hire? What are they doing about labour hire? They are standing by. This is an antiworker government standing by, letting labour hire rip apart the wages and income of working people in this country and ripping apart families. This is unacceptableâ652 days for these Esso workers! Guess what their parent company, ExxonMobil, are paying in tax? It is zero dollars.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Today I rise to inform the parliament of the inspirational program Bush to Beach, founded by Jack Cannon AM, president of Variety, the international children's charity. The Bush to Beach program connects the northern beaches of Sydney with young people from the remote community of north-west New South Wales. It was borne from a simple call for help in 1992. Aunty Joyce Doole, a Brewarrina elder, reached out to Jack Cannon and Variety: one hundred children in her community had no Christmas presentsâcould he help? The issues these young people faced went far beyond this, of course. Importantly, they faced challenges in attending school. So Jack, in collaboration with Joyce, founded a program that would improve school attendance and social outcomes and give these children an experience unlike any other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians have the great privilege of living on the doorstep of our renown beaches. But the bus from Brewarrina to Narrabeen takes 12 hoursâa 24-hour round trip. Each year, young people aged six to 16 take this journeyâa reward for good behaviour and excellent attendance. They learn surf and water safety so that they can look after themselves and others. They learn vital skills. I am proud to support Jack and the remarkable opportunities that the Bush to Beach program provides, and I urge others to do so.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  In my electorate of Richmond, locals know that Tuesday night's budget was a desperate act by a desperate government. Here we are just six weeks before an election, and the Liberals and Nationals will say and do anything to try to cover up for years of harmful cuts. But locals know that this budget con can't cover up those six years of their inaction on the New South Wales North Coast. After six long years of the Liberals' and Nationals' cuts, chaos and dysfunction my community has had enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a budget from a government that has just given up governing. That is what's happened. The budget has no plans for wages, no plans to tackle power prices, no plans to address climate change and no plans for the future. Also, the budget has failed to reverse those harmful cuts to schools and hospitals and failed to reverse those cuts to TAFE and apprenticeships. Of course, they were promising a surplus, but subsidised by short-changing people with a disability through a massive underspend in the NDISâtruly shameful. Budgets are all about priorities. For six years the Liberals and Nationals have prioritised an $80 billion tax handout for the top end of town over Medicare, schools and hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A Shorten Labor government will have different priorities. Our Fair Go Action Plan will put people first by fixing our schools and hospitals, easing the pressure on family budgets, standing up for workers, investing in cheaper and cleaner energy and, really importantly, building a strong economy that works for all of us. The fact is: only Bill Shorten and Labor will deliver a fair go for all Australian, not just the top end of town.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  The Morrison government is busting congestion in Boothby. This week the Treasurer announced another fantastic congestion-busting project for my community, with $85.5 million to fix Hove rail crossing. The Hove rail crossing on Brighton Road is one of the biggest concerns that local residents raise with me. The crossing causes congestion and delays for motorists on a daily basis, especially during peak hour and the school drop-off and pick-up. That's why I've been working hard, together with my state colleagues David Speirs MP and Corey Wingard MP, to fix Hove crossing once and for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government's record of delivering on congestion-busting projects in my community speaks for itself, with the nearby Oaklands Crossing grade separation project almost complete. Working together with our community, David Speirs and Corey Wingard, I fought for and secured a $95 million federal funding contribution to deliver Oaklands Crossing, which, combined with our $2.7 billion investment to fix the north-south corridorâand particularly South Roadâwill improve travel times along the entire coastal corridor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not all we are doing. We are also busting congestion at the intersection of Fullarton Road and Cross Road, with a $30.5 million investment, and at Springbank, Daws and Goodwood roads, with a $17Â½ million federal funding commitment. We are doing this because we want to make it safer and easier for people to get to work, to get their kids to school and to get around our community.</span>

It will arguably be the biggest irrigation project in the nation's history by itself, but it is also Bradfield's stage 1. It will produce seven per cent of Australia's petrol which is cleanâethanol, of course. The former American Vice-President Al Gore in <span style="font-style:italic;">An Inconvenient Truth</span> said the first solution to the CO2 problem in the world is ethanol. It will produce 1Â½ per cent of Australia's electricity and almost all of North Queensland's electricity and will feed nearly a million head of cattle as well.</span>

There are 1,630 that have commenced because of this trial.

I would like to thank Kathy Palmer from the Wingham newsagency next door who trained him in retail when he was at school. I would also like to thank Jarrah and Kristy Anchor, who have taken on James Eppingstall as apprentice mechanic in Taree, and Gary Byrne of Camden Haven Plumbing, who has appointed Rohan Davis as a plumber apprentice.</span>

For those who are looking to start an apprenticeship, this is extra on top of it.

Cecil Northover served Australia in both world wars. He enlisted in Perth and fought in Gallipoli. He then fought in the trenches of France and Belgium. He was awarded the Military Cross in May of 1918 for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty and for setting a magnificent example to his men.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lieutenant Northover returned to Australia as a war hero but wounded in both body and mind. He suffered from his injuries and so did his familyâhis wife, Mable, and his daughter, Betty. Cecil re-enlisted as a private soldier in 1941 when World War II came to Australia's shores and was posted to Darwin. He died in 1949 in Darwin, aged 54, and was buried in a grave that was only marked '1084'.</span>

I want to thank Mr Gary Gallagher and Mr Shaun Johnston for their advocacy to get this done and also Jack Hamilton and Lance Johnson for driving this initiative and the City of Darwin for their support. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Morrison government is on track to eliminate net debt by 2029-30. Our Liberal coalition government is also keeping taxes as a share of GDP within the 23.9 per cent cap, limiting the tax burden on Australians. For residents in my electorate of Moore with mortgages, it is important to keep inflation under control through responsible spending to ensure less upward pressure on interest rates and to keep housing affordable for young families in our northern suburbs.</span>

Immediate tax relief will flow to low- and middle-income earners of up to $1,080 for singles or up to $2,160 for families. Around 4.5 million individuals will see the full benefit for the 2018-19 income year. The budget is back in the black and Australia is back on track! </span>

So, each time the Prime Minister boasts about his budget surplus, my community need to know that $1.6 billion of that is because people with a disability are being forced to wait longer for support. My office has already helped almost 300 NDIS participants and their families, struggling with delays and setbacks. This underspend will cause more delays to more families in my community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget fails to reverse cuts to TAFE and apprenticeships. In the past six years, the Liberals have cut $3 billion from TAFEs and skills and cut 150,000 apprenticeship places. Locally, in Dobell, between 2013-16, this has seen a 33 per cent drop in the number of apprentices and trainees. This means 1,027 fewer apprentices and trainees on job sites, taking up a trade, learning skills and boosting our local economy. </span>

This budget does not deliver one new home care package that the government has not already announced. On the Central Coast, the number of people on the waitlist who have no package increased from 1,178 in September to 1,286 by the end of December 2018. Most of these people are high-needs and waiting for level 3 or 4 packages.</span>

They can choose a very fine National Party candidate in Pat Conaghan, a local man who grew up Kempsey, who was a policeman in Kempsey and who became a police prosecutor and, ultimately, a criminal lawyer. He is a person who knows the needs of our local area. But in the field for the next election we have a pretender, and that pretender is the former member for Lyne. He masquerades as an Independent, but we all know on the North Coast that he is LaborâLabor in Independent's clothing. So when the people move forward and come to the ballot box they will know that, if they choose the former member for Lyne, they will be voting for a retiree tax, they will be voting for a carbon tax, they will be voting to put Bill Shorten into the Lodge. </span>

Vote for Pat Conaghan, the National Party candidate, a great local champion. He is someone who will stand up for the needs of the electorate of Cowper. He is someone who will ensure that the voice of Cowper is heard. The former member for Lyne propped up a government that did not spend one cent on mobile phone communications. </span>

After five years of underperformance, chaos and division, the Australian people will get the opportunity to cast a verdict on this lacklustre Prime Minister and his second-rate ministry. Nothing highlights the division and the ramshackle incompetence of this government than its inability to make a decision on a how-to-vote card. Last week the Prime Minister, after exhausting absolutely every other alternative, did the right thing after witnessing the expose of One Nation in a sting, trying to take NRA money and take it to Australia to corrupt our politics. The Prime Minister did the right thing and instructed the Liberal Party to put One Nation last. It should have been a unifying moment in Australian politics, but the National Party were having none of it, because in Dawson, in Capricornia and in Flynn they have been cuddling up to One Nation, because they want their preferences. Those members should do the right thing: they should put One Nation last and they should explain to their electorates. We can't go overseas and say: 'We want you to buy our beef, our wheat, our sugar, our coal and our iron ore, but we don't like ya. We don't want you near our country. We don't like the look of you and we don't like your religion.' If you can't agree on how to voteâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  This has been a fruitful 45th Parliament for the people of Canning. We have had many wins over the past three years. We have delivered funding of $25 million for Peel Health Campus. We have funded the Peel Business Park. We have expanded aged care in Pinjarra and Waroona. We have funded the Roleystone Karragullen Cricket Club pavilion. And we've had numerous other budgets funded, especially this week in the budgetâprojects like the Tonkin Highway upgrade and expansion, including $404 million to extend the highway south past Mundijong Road connecting it to the South Western Highway, getting big trucks out of residential areas. We have $22 million to construct the Pinjarra heavy haulage deviation, which the town voted 84 per cent in favour of at a local referendum in 2017. It will stop more than 690 trucks passing through that historic town every day and activate that township as a tourist destination for many Australians and international visitors. There is $16 million to expand the Mandurah Train Station car park, getting people to and from home more quickly. There is $10 million towards the construction of the Lakelands Train Station. The People of North Mandurah overwhelmingly want this station, but WA Labor calls it 'the station that no-one needs'. Labor is openly ignoring our community, but I won't stop fighting for it. Finally, there is $10 million to upgrade the intersection of Thomas and Nicholson roads, one of the most dangerous intersections in the state of Western Australia, to make it saferâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  If you look at this chamber, you could assume 57 is the average age of male politicians or the year that some of them were born. You might assume 57 is the number of times the Prime Minister mentioned Labor yesterday in question time or the opposition leader's name. It is actually a lot more cynical. On budget night, the government announced a very small tax cut for people earning less than $40,000âand 57 per cent of those workers are women. It says a lot about this government that it would rather give a banker, in a predominantly male industry, a tax cut of $11,000 a year but a woman working in retail a tax cut of about $250 a year. That is the kind of government that we've got. This is a government that will prioritise their own mates and themselves. And is it any wonder, given who is on the government benches? Take a look. Whether it be the economic team, the frontbench or the backbench, they are dominated by men. They govern for men. They are not governing for Australian women. Bring on this election so we can elect a government that will show gender equality and fair opportunity for everybody regardless of whether they are a man or a woman. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  I want to talk about mental health. I rise to thank the locals and organisations in my electorate who selflessly support some of the most vulnerable people in our community. Last week I caught up with the Way Back Support Service in Redcliffe, based at Encircle, who do an incredible job locally through their suicide prevention program. I was able to secure $1.2 million for the organisation, over four years, to support and expand their services over the next few years. For people living with a mental illness, life is incredibly hard. And this hardship doesn't just affect the person; it also affects their family, their friends and our community as a whole. Madeleine, from the Lakes College in North Lakes, wrote to me. She said: 'I have witnessed firsthand the devastating and debilitating impacts of mental health both in respect to personal experience and in witnessing the collective effect it has had on those around me. Plans must be put in place to work towards creating an environment that allows students to succeed academically without having to neglect their own mental health. Mental health issues do not have to be part of life. Anxiety and depression are not part of growing up. This is something that needs to change and will only change with your help.' Madeleine is right, and that is why this government is actingâwith millions of dollars invested for more services for people living with mental health, millions of dollars to trial eight adult mental health centres, 30 new headspaces and $54 million over six years to establish four specialist residential facilities for eating disorders. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  What he won't tell you tonight is that under our government, over the last five years, funding from the Commonwealth for hospitals has increased by 63.2 per cent. In New South Wales that's up by 56.4 per cent. In Victoria it's up by 54.8 per cent. In Queensland it's up by 95.6 per cent. In Tasmania it's up by over 40 per cent. Here in the ACT it's up by over 100 per cent. Under our government we have been increasing investment in hospitals all around the country, and the same is true of schools. Under our government, when it comes to public schools and state schools, those funded over the last five years, funding is up by 62 per cent. Funding for preschools has also gone up by 87 per cent. This is the record of our government. Investing in the essential services: that's what a strong economy does, and that's what managing a budget does. It enables you to invest in these essential services.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party will go to the Australian people and won't tell them the truth about what the government has done. I'll tell you what they will do: they'll tax Australians and they'll tax them hard. They'll tax them when they're old, they'll tax them when they're young and they'll tax them at all stages. That's what they'll do, because that's what the Labor Party always do. When they run out of their own money, they come running after the hard-earned savings and the earnings of Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the next election, the choice will be all about the future when it comes to who the Prime Minister of this country is. The choice will be very clear. On this side of the House, if I'm elected again at the next electionâI was elected as the member for Cook at the last election. At the next election there is a clear choice between myself as Prime Minister of this country leading the Liberal and the National team and the Leader of the Labor Party leading his team. It will be between myself as the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. But the election will be all about Australians and the choices that they want for themselves, and a stronger economyâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What underpins this budget that we handed down this week is a fundamental principle that Liberals and Nationals feel passionately about; that is, in this country, there should be a fair go for those who have a go. There should be reward for working hard. There should be the opportunity to keep more of what you earn. If you're starting a business, if you're employing people, if you're investing, if you're taking risksâ</span>

                  </a>  if you're doing all of those things, you should be rewarded for that effort. That is what the budget this week has delivered yet again: a budget that ensures that Australians will be able to keep more of what they earn and that, if you're running a small family businessâwhen you are the last person to take a wage, not the first; you pay your staff first and you take your own wage lastâwe will be there, as we have been over the last 5Â½ years. As this budget has demonstrated yet again, we will continue to invest in the hard work and enterprise of Australians, because that is the underpinning of our budget. Our budget is not underpinned by the $200 billion of higher taxes which will be part of a Labor government. That has no place in the plan of the Liberal and National parties to actually take the country forward. But it is central to the plan that the Labor Party are putting forward.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I doubt you'll hear tonight about the $200 billion of higher taxes from the Labor Party. I doubt you'll hear about the $5 billion every single year they want to take out of the pockets of retirees. You won't hear about the housing tax that is going to put extreme pressure on and drive up rents for young families saving for a first home or undermine the value of the homes of those who've gone out and are paying their mortgages and working hard every week. You won't hear about that. You won't hear about the extra taxes that people will pay on their superannuation. You won't hear about the fact that the Labor Party refused to support the government's policy to abolish an entire 37c tax bracket. You won't hear that they want to change and oppose the policy that says we want people on $50,000 a year to pay no more than 30c in the dollar in tax. The Labor Party want them to pay 32Â½c. The Labor Party want to tax you more and tell untruths about the government. As we go into tonight's budget response from the Leader of the Opposition, all I suspect we'll hear, once again, is what I suspect will be put out there at the next election: more Labor lies and more Labor taxes.</span>

                  </a>  Medicare funding is up by 27 per cent. Bulk-billing is at an all-time high as a result of the strong economy and the strong budget management that we have been running as a government for the last 5Â½ years. That strong budget management meantâfrom the time when I delivered last year's budget up until nowâwe ended the year estimated to be $10 billion better off than what we said in last year's budget. As a result, we took the decision to repeat a measure we put in place a couple of years ago which said that we would provide a one-off payment to support people on pensionsâthat is, the permanent welfare benefits of pensions. And that's what we decided to do. We've done it before, because we're used to actually outperforming budgets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We took that measure forward and we then decided that we wanted to have that legislated as quickly as possible to ensure that that measure would get to those pension recipients. There was clearly a mood within this chamber that they wanted to see that extended to other benefits, and we took the practical decision, the honest decision, to do the right thing and not engage in the argy-bargy of partisanship and politics but make a practical decision to get the money to the people we wanted to get it to. We took that decision, and the entire chamber voted for it. So I thank the Leader of the Opposition, I thank my own members and I thank the crossbench for supporting the government's decision to extend that payment to all of those members who will now receive it.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for Bowman for his question and I'm glad he's wearing a shirt from 1989âthe year that Labor last delivered a surplus. It was 30 years ago. The Berlin Wall was still standing, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Simpsons</span> had their first episode, and I had a mullet! They were the days!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said on budget night, the budget is back in the black and Australia is back on track with a surplus of $7.1 billion in 2019-20, a surplus of $11 billion the next year, a surplus of $17.8 billion the year after and a surplus of $9.2 billion in the year after thatâsurpluses of $45 billion over the forward estimates. We on this side of the House know how to balance budgets. The Labor Party always deliver you bigger and bigger deficits and higher and higher taxes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the member for Bowman's electorate, more than 16,000 small businesses will benefit from the instant asset write-off that's now been extended to $30,000 and to companies with turnover of up to $50 million. In the member for Bowman's electorate, more than 68,000 income earners will benefit from the tax cuts we have announced, which will go to 13.3 million Australians, as a result of our sound fiscal management.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, we believe there needs to be a discipline with tax and there need to be limits to the amount that the Australian people are taxed, because, at the end of the day, it's not the government's money; it's the people's money. We want to return more money to the people of Australia at every opportunity. But, every step of the way, we're blocked by those opposite, because the Labor Party do not believe in lower taxes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight the Leader of the Opposition will give his budget reply speech. But whenever he opens his wallet the Australian people need to check theirs, because he's coming after their money. Whenever the Leader of the Opposition makes a promise, the Australian people need to ask a simple question: what taxes is the Leader of the Opposition increasing to pay for his promises? We are spending record amountsâon hospitals, on schools, on roads and on infrastructure linking our regions to our citiesâwithout increasing taxes. That's our record and that's what's in our budget. Only the coalition will deliver more jobs, higher growth and lower taxes.</span>

                  </a>  My question is to the Prime Minister. This government has forecast an election surplus by starving the National Disability Insurance Scheme of money, leaving Australians with a disability without the services they so desperately need. Why should Australians living with a disability pay the price for the Prime Minister's con-job budget?</span>

It has enjoyed the support of both sides of this House. There is not, I suspect, a member of this House who does not have either a direct or an indirect association with someone who lives with a disability or the family of someone with a disability. For the National Disability Insurance Scheme to be used today, as it was yesterday, by the Labor Party as a political plaything to try to score cheap points in this chamber is shameful. It is absolutely shameful.</span>

It's fully funded, and if the estimates of demand contained in that budget are increased and there is greater demand then every single claim, every single package and every single payment will be made to support that program. If the estimates of the demand for that program are greater than what is in the budget then there will be a variation to reflect that and the funding will flow. There is no impediment whatsoever to the additional flow of funds to the NDIS for this program, and for the opposition to cause needless anxiety amongst people and the families of people with disabilities shows just how low they are prepared to go at this election. This should be a matter of bipartisanship.</span>

There are 128,000 elderly Australians who are waiting for a home care package, with delays of up to two years. The waiting list grows by 20,000 every six months. I have many elderly constituents desperately waiting for help with showering and with keeping their homes clean. As 93-year-old Jack said to me, 'If we can't get help at this age, how bad does it have to get?' Treasurer, why did you fund just 10,000 new home care packages in your budget? Why are you treating our most vulnerable older Australians this way?</span>

I can inform her that we've actually funded 40,000 new additional home care packages since the 2017-18 MYEFO and that in 2019-20 the government, led by the minister, is providing $21.6 billion to fund better services for aged care. This is an increase of more than 50 per cent for aged-care funding, since 2013-14. And in this budget we are providing $282 million for an additional 10,000 home care packages, to support older Australians who wish to stay at home. As of 30 September 2018, 74 per cent more people had access to a high-level package than at 30 June 2017. The government is also providing $5.9 billion, over two years from 2020-21, to extend the Commonwealth Home Support Program, providing access to essential services and home support services like Meals on Wheels. The government is also providing $320 million in a general subsidy boost this yearâin 2018-19âfor residential aged care, and 13,500 new residential care places.</span>

We believe in helping those Australians who need our help and we are funding it in record amounts.</span>

This will complete the ring road and make the movement of freight, passenger, tourism traffic along the Bruce Highway corridor better than ever. Townsville Chamber of Commerce CEO Marie-Claude Brown said, 'It's certainly one of these projects which is creating work and creating economic stimulus.' She continued, 'It links key areas like the Burdekin, to the south of Townsville, through the northern beaches, very quickly, and is also an important link for Lavarack Barracks, Annandale and the Townsville hospital.' Yes, that's what she said. Stage 5 of the ring road will complete the entire 22 kilometres of the route to four lanes, easing congestion. That's what we're doing. The Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities is helping to bust through urban congestion with that $4 billion fundâup fourfold. It is something that Herbert LNP candidate Phillip Thompson fought for, and we are delivering. It comes on the back of the Mackay Ring Road, the investment the member for Dawson fought for and we delivered. He fought for it in a rather novel wayâhe did a Borat, but we won't subject the parliament to that picture! It comes on the back of the Rockhampton Ring Road, which the member for Capricornia fought for and we delivered. It comes on the back of our investment in the Cairns Ring Road, which the member for Leichhardt fought for and we delivered.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what Liberals and Nationals do: we deliver. We deliver in every corner of Queenslandâjobs, opportunities, safer, better roads. It's a budget for the bush, a budget for regional Australia, a budget for infrastructureâa surplus budget. Have you heard about that? A surplus budgetâthat's right. That's what the Liberals and Nationals are good at. It's what we delivered. Those opposite do not support the regionsâunfortunately, they do not. They want to take Queensland's ridiculous land-clearing laws and nationalise them. They want to put a carbon tax on all of our farmers once again. They want to close down small business and put on more taxes. Shame on them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Is it a moral failure for the Prime Minister to pay for his forecast election surplus by starving the NDIS of money, leaving Australians with a disability without the services they needâlike the young family in Victoria whose daughter has an intellectual disability? She waited 10 months for her NDIS funding to be processed, which delayed her getting the speech therapy she needs to learn to engage at school.</span>

The NDIS is one of the biggest social projects we've been engaged in and to ever come out of this chamber. There is multipartisan support, with the crossbench and others supporting this program. All of our attention is needed to continue to improve its delivery, whether it's the case that the member referred to or any of the many other cases that we are all aware of as we implement this very difficult program that requires tailored programs and packages of support to each and every single individual. Our government is committed to that.</span>

That is what is morally shameful. We will stand here ready to support every dollar that the NDIS needs every single day. We will do it as we did when we were in opposition and we will do it as we have done in government. It has our full attention and it has our full support. It will get every single dollar it needs. I appeal to the Labor Party not to engage in these dark, political, shameful questions that reflect not on the morality of the government but on the morality of the Leader of the Opposition.</span>

                  </a>  It took John Howard and Peter Costello years to pay back Labor's debt. Now it has been left to the Morrison government to do it again. On budget night we put the first payment back on Labor's debt, with a surplus of $7.1 billion and $45 billion of surpluses over the forward estimates and a $55 billion turnaround on the fiscal mess that we inherited from the Labor Party. We have brought spending under control. Growth in government spending is now the lowest of any government in 50 years. The proportion of working-age Australians on welfare is the lowest of any government in 30 years. We have funded hospitals, schools and roads in record amounts. We have done all of that without increasing taxes. That is what we've done. </span>

Labor's tax billâ$200 billion of new taxes: a housing tax, with a 50 per cent increase in capital gains that could come at the worst possible time for the housing market; a shameful retirees tax on more than one million Australians who have done nothing wrong; a new tax on superannuation that's going to prevent catch-up contributions for mothers who have been out of the workforce having children; and a tax on family businesses, which is going to make their lives that much more difficult.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the housing tax, whatever the Leader of the Opposition says, for lower income earners, what he needs to tell the people of Australia tonight is how he's going to increase their rents, because, if you live in Brisbane, your rent will go up by up to $90 a week. If you're in Melbourne, your rent will go up by up to $65 a week. If you're in Adelaide or if you're in Perth, your rent will go up by up to $60 a week. And if you're in Sydney, under Labor's plan, your rent will go up by up to $50 a week.</span>

The government has not awarded any funding under this program, because the program is not open. And it's no surprise that the members opposite have not been out there engaging with their communities, because their spokesperson for the environment has said that, should they occupy these benchesâwhich they're not going toâhe will abolish the $22 million Communities Environment Program. So we know what the threat is to the Communities Environment Programâand it is not us sitting on this side. That's right: under Labor, local communities will not have the opportunity to contribute, in a $22 million fund. What a disgrace!</span>

It is great to be busting congestion in her electorate, with $35 million going into new commuter car parks at Gosford and at Woy Woy, taking hundreds of cars off the streets in that area. Of course, the member for Robertson is also a very strong supporter of the NorthConnex project, another fantastic project, which will make it easier for people on the Central Coast to be able to get down and work in Sydney, if they do that on a regular basis.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These congestion-busting projects are just part of a $100 billion infrastructure plan which the Treasurer announced just a couple of nights ago. This is for massive congestion-busting in every single capital city. It includes national rail and road projects which the Deputy Prime Minister has been talking about, and of course it includes making our roads safer as well. Part of our $100 billion plan includes a fast rail plan. Our plan is to connect the satellite cities to the large capital cities of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane respectively. That would include, for example, connecting Newcastle to Sydney so that residents of the Central Coast would be included. It would also include, for example, connecting the Gold Coast to Brisbane as well as connecting places like Wodonga and Shepparton to Melbourne. The very first one which we are getting going on our fast rail plan is the Geelong to Melbourne fast rail. We've put $2 billion into the budget to get it going, and it will start in a couple of years time. It will enable a 32-minute journey from Geelong to Melbourne, and the member for Corangamite is one of the strongest supporters of this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you, Mr Speaker, they're laughing on the other side, but we on this side of the table are united in relation to getting on board the ScoMo Express. It's going to be starting in two years time. It will make a real difference for the people of Geelong. The people of Geelong are on board the ScoMo Express as well, and I know the people of Gosford equally want to see their fast rail done. The challenge tonight for the Leader of the Opposition is to change his mind and join us in jumping on board the ScoMo Express. Here's your opportunity, Leader of the Opposition. Don't stand with your Labor union mates campaigning against us on our fast rail plan. Join our fast rail plan. Join the people of Geelong. Join the people of Gosford. Back our fast rail plan so that people can get to their capital cities sooner and faster. Tonight is the night for the Leader of the Opposition to let us know what his plan is.</span>

He knows this because of historyâbecause in 2011 a previous government stopped listing the medicines. And who was the Assistant Treasurer in that year at that time? The hand that was on the budget papers was the now Leader of the Opposition, the person who's going to deliver a budget-in-reply speech tonight. He was the person who stopped listing the medicine. By contrast, we have a Prime Minister whose proudest claim is to have helped listâwithin the cabinet as Treasurer and as Prime Ministerâ2,000 new medicines during the course of this government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this election there will be a choice when it comes to managing healthâa choice between the man who stopped the medicines and the man who has delivered the medicines. This might be the night when the Leader of the Opposition, if wants to say anything on health, might apologise for stopping the listing of new medicines when he was the Assistant Treasurer. And it wasn't just a casual phase; it was there in the budget of their day. Let me quote what that budget said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ given the current fiscal environment, the listing of some medicines would be deferred until fiscal circumstances permit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that means is they ran out of money and they stopped listing medicines. That's what happened. That means severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, blood clots, deep vein thrombosis, endometriosis, in vitro fertilisation and chronic schizophrenia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, we have been able to lift Medicare spending from $19 billion to, in the coming year, $26 billion, and to $27 billion, $29 billion and $31 billion over the forward estimates; and to lift hospital spending from $13 billion to $23 billion, to $24 billion, to $25 billion and to $26 billion. Perhaps most importantly of all, we've brought new medicines onto the PBS, such as Orkambi and Spinrazaâin which the Prime Minister played such an important roleâfor spinal muscular atrophy; and new medicines this week, such as Ibrance for breast cancer, and Besponsa and Bavencio for Merkel cell carcinoma. So, when it comes to this election, there will be a choice in health. It will be a choice between the 'Medi-frauds' in Labor and the 'Medi-friends' in the coalition.</span>

I know he is absolutely passionate about education and making sure that the schools in his electorate are looked after. I'd like to inform the House that when it comes to the Education portfolio there are two words that are worth remembering: record funding. We are providing record funding for child careâ$8.6 billion in 2019 alone. When it comes to preschool, we are providing record funding for preschoolâ$451 million next year. And we are funding preschool in exactly the same way the Labor Party did, through national partnership agreements. But we also want to make sure that all children are attending preschool. That is why we are engaging The Smith Family to develop a strategy on attendance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to schools, we are providing record funding for all schoolsâfor public schools, for Catholic schools and for independent schools. Our $310 billion Quality Schools Package will deliver needs based funding for the first time, with an increase of 62 per cent per student. Every year we have spent more on schools and we have worked to deliver the reforms teachers and parents want for students. Funding for state schoolsâand this is a really important pointâunder the coalition has increased three times faster than funding from state governments. That is our record. When it comes to higher education, we are providing record funding for higher education, with $17.7 billion this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also asked about the choiceâwhat will those on the other side do? What will they do? What they will do is provide record funding when it comes to taxation. They want to tax the Australian people at record levels. They want to absolutely smother the Australian economy, so they won't be able to afford the essential services. That will be their record. As other ministers have said at the despatch box today, what we won't hear from the Leader of the Opposition is about the $200 billion of new taxes that he wants to put on the Australian people and the devastating impact that will have on the Australian economy.</span>

Given that in the previous answer the Minister for the Environment said she was only seeking expressions of interest, how was she doing this for a program that, at the time, did not exist and had no guidelines? Does the minister stand by her earlier answer, or, when the media release went out announcing successful projects, did the member for Dunkley mislead his electorate?</span>

What's wrong with it? That's a very good project. We went there to talk about an expression of interest. What do you have against Friends of Langwarrin Outdoors and Waterways? Again, it's a very good group of committed environmentalists. And the South Eastern Centre for Sustainabilityâagain, very good, committed local people.</span>

He's a strong advocate for carers. Carers do so much important work. There are nearly a thousand people on carer payment in his electorate of Bennelong. He was very pleased, I know, as will be the carers in his electorate and all around Australia, at the fact that in this year's budget our government has announced an $84.3 million funding boost for new carer services being progressively rolled out to Australia's 2.7 million carers in 2019. I emphasise to the House that this is new money. It builds on the additional $85.6 million we announced in March 2018 to fund new supports for carers through the new integrated carer support service model. Indeed, our total funding commitment for the new integrated carer support services will be over $550 million over the next four years. What that means is that it will provide over 300,000 instances of support to carers, compared to the 130,000 currently provided. It is one of the biggest reforms to carer services in a decade. We're going to see new digital-counselling, coaching and peer support services for carers, which are currently being designed and tested. They'll be rolled out nationally later this year through Carer Gateway, the Morrison government's national website and phone service for carers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked whether there are alternative approaches which would involve raising taxes on hardworking Australians. It turns out that there are. It turns out that those on the other side of the House seem to think that the only way to competently deliver the services that Australians expect is to raise taxesâ$200 billion of new taxes is what Labor is proposing. What we delivered in this budget, what the Treasurer has delivered, what our Liberal-National government has delivered, is improved services without increasing taxes. This government understands how to manage money, but Labor cannot manage money. They are so fiscally clueless that they produced, under the member for Lilley, deficit after deficit; we've announced the first surplus for 12 years. They are so fiscally clueless, they are so inept that they do not understand that, on the NDIS, we are delivering an increase in funding of $4.5 billion from 2018-19 through to 2019-20. That lot are managerially hopeless. They are fiscally incompetent. They are utterly unable even to read the budget papers. The thought of them being responsible for delivering the budget papers should terrify every Australian.</span>

I think the members on this side of the House want to do the right thing about the environment. I'll tell you another thing about the environment: we don't believe that you have to choose between having a clean environment and a strong economy. We don't believe you have to do that. We believe you can have responsible emissions reduction targets, meet the commitments that you've made internationally and have a strong economy. We believe both of those can be achieved, but the Leader of the Opposition doesn't. The Leader of the Opposition wants to put in place a wrecking ball on the Australian economy to implement a 45 per cent emissions reduction target which will put up the price of everything. He wants to tell Australians what sort of car they have to drive and what they have to put in their kids' lunchboxâso far does this Leader of the Opposition want to intrude into the lives of all Australians. He wants to put up their taxes. It doesn't matter whether they're a retiree or just someone out there working hard, he wants to put more taxes and more burdens on the Australian people.</span>

Our plan is there for all to see. Our commitments on emissions reductions have been demonstrated in turning around a more than 700 million tonne deficit to our Kyoto 2020 commitments, which was left to us by the previous government, into a 369 million tonne overachievement. So, on this side of the House, we are delivering on our commitments to the environment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget itself there is not only the program that has been referred to, which ensures every single part of this country can benefit from the local environmental programs and grants that will support them in their local communities, but also a further $100 million environment fund that will support larger projects in regional areas as well as in metropolitan areas. That's what we're doing. What the Labor Party is going to do with their reckless emissions reduction target is going to cost Australian wages some $9,000 per person. That is the price, and I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to come clean tonight on the real cost to the economy of his reckless emissions target.</span>

It gives me a wonderful opportunity to speak about this Liberal-National government's economic management and the fact that, because we have grown such a strong economy, we are in a good position to be able to invest in industry, science, innovation and technology. We are already investing $9.6 billion in science, research and technology, and we are building on that with the announcement that was in the budget earlier this week. We are going to make sure that we are able to grow the economy, that we are going to be able to continue to invest in science, research and technology, and that we are delivering for the jobs of the future. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We announced this week a further $166 million for some smart investments in our industry and science sectors. Let me start with the $15.1 million that we have committed to fund for Questacon. We will be expanding their education outreach, because we understand how important it is for our young children, particularly those who are in regional Australia, to have access to science education. Of course Questacon is one Australia's icons in the work that it has done over many years to inspire our young Australians. We need that, because we know that 75 per cent of the jobs of the future are going to require skills in science, technology, engineering and maths. We know that currently there are not enough students in years 9, 10, 11 and 12 studying those subjects to equip them for the jobs of the future. So that is a $15.1 million investment in Questacon to enable them to continue their outreach in science education.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing $3.6 million in the Innovation Games, to make sure that university students and graduates have the chance to apply their skills to real-world problems and to solve challenges for small businesses. We are providing $3.4 million for STEM gender equity in Australia, because we know that women are underrepresented in the STEM fields. And, of course, this is the government that has committed to the space sector here in Australia. We have committed over $300 million to the space sector. We have built on that in this year's budget. We're committing more funding to a space infrastructure fund and we're establishing a space discovery centre because we know that we can grow the space sector. We can triple it in size by 2030. There will be $12 billion and an extra 20,000 jobs.</span>

Do you know what, Mr Speaker? That funding is up from less than $13Â½ billionâit was $13.3 billionâunder Labor to $23 billion, $24 billion, $25 billion and $26 billion in this budget.

We have the man in the red tie, the Leader of the Opposition, over there. What was his greatest health achievement? He stopped the medicines. That is something for which he should apologise tonight. This is his time to shine. This is his time to fess up. This is his time to apologise for stopping the medicines. Around Australia, we will see record funding for hospitals each and every year, which can come about only when you have a strong economyâan economy built on well over a million new jobs, an economy built on paying down the government's budget and bringing it back to surplus, an economy which comes from the hard work of Australians who have been empowered by a lower tax regime. That allows us to do things such as setting out record funding for Medicare, record funding for hospitals and record numbers of new listings.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:04</span>):  I thank the honourable member very much for his question. As we pointed out yesterday, we've made a record investment in the Australian Federal Police. We support very much the work of the Australian Federal Police and all of the agencies within the Home Affairs portfolio because they do work to keep Australians safe. My strongest passion has been the protection of children and women from sexual assault, and we've done a significant amount in cancelling visas to kick out of our country people who have assaulted children and women, and we'll continue to do that. We've also made a significant investment in the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation. We've done that because we've been able to manage the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor were in government they ran every year at a loss. What happened was that they ran out of money, and the Australian Federal Police and the other agencies weren't able to undertake the additional work that they wanted, whether it was investigations into drug offences, whether it was investigations into outlaw motorcycle gangs, whether it was investigations in relation to paedophilesâwhatever it might have been. They cannot do it without the funding. Labor ran out of money. As the health minister pointed out before, when they ran out of money they stopped listing medicines. But they also cut money from the Federal Police. They cut $128 million between the 2010-11 and 2013-14 financial years, they cut $30 million and 88 staff from the ACC between 2007-08 and 2013-14, they cut $27 million and 56 staff from AUSTRAC between 2009-10 and 2013-14, and they cut $735 million and 700 staff from Customs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their period in government, as people recall, was a disaster at every level. Fifty thousand people came on 800 boats; 1,200 people, including women and children, drowned at sea; and they put 8,000 children in detention. Did that come at no cost? It came at a cost of $16 billion. If you're spending $16 billion because you've opened up our borders to people smugglers to be in control, you take money away from other areas of expenditure, including health and education and, obviously, policing. In managing the budget and getting it back into a profit this year, we have been able to invest in very important areas like this. Keeping children and women safe is a fundamental responsibility for a federal government, and we have done it in a way that the Labor Party never could. They waste money. They tax and spend but they waste money across government. The fact is that we will do whatever it takes to support Australian families, to support children and women, in particular, right across the community, and we'll do it because we manage the economy and the budget so well.</span>

The Crib Point gas port projects are intended to provide a cost-effective, secure supply of natural gas to south-eastern Australia by importing LNG from Australian and international markets. The current proposals are being thoroughly assessed for impacts to matters protected under the national environment law, such as the Western Port Ramsar wetland threatened and migratory species. Once the assessment is finalised, separate decisions on whether or not to approve the proposals will be made by the Victorian and Commonwealth governments.</span>

                  </a>  On all these counts we have been successful in meeting our commitments to the Australian people. That is in stark contrast to what happened back in 2007, when the people of Australia chose to go on a different path and elect a Labor government. And I can tell you that they have paid for the decision they made in 2007 for a decade because of the fiscal recklessness of the former Labor Party. We have stopped the boats and we have ensured they have remained stopped. But the Labor Party have still learnt none of the lessons of their failures in border protection when they were in office. Only a few months ago they came into this place and voted to weaken our borders.</span>

That's what we're seeing, and that's what you'll see tonight. Our budget is back into the black. The last time the Labor Party saw a budget surplus, as we know, was in 1989. The Leader of the OppositionâI don't know what his hairstyle was like back then, but he was running around, I know, at those Labor vanguard conferences at the time, whipping it up with his friends at parties and goodness knows what. That was the last time that we saw a budget surplus delivered by the Labor Party. But, under this government, that surplus has been achieved, the boats have been stopped, the carbon tax has been abolished and we're building the infrastructure of the 21st century.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PYNE:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. To the chagrin of a few and the joy of many, maybe even some in this place, I'm retiring from the Australian parliament. On 28 April 1992, I was preselected for Sturt. The opening lines of my speech were: 'In 1966, after 17 years, Sir Keith Wilson handed Sturt over to his son Ian. Now, 26 years later, it's time to change again.' Of course, I went on to win that preselection. After almost 27 years, it's time for renewal in Sturt again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank the Liberal Party in South Australia and in Sturt for giving me the opportunity to carry the Liberal banner in this seat for nine elections, for over a quarter of a century. They're a wonderful group of people. The Liberal Party in South Australia and nationally can be a rambunctious group of people at times, but I believe in the party and I always will. Like the member for Grayndler, I'm a team man. I just happened to go for the team that is the election-winning machine!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank the electors of Sturt: thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve you and the privilege of representing you. I'm confident that I leave my seat and the great state of South Australia in good shape. I'm sure that the Liberal Party's candidateâand my good friendâJames Stephens will retain Sturt at the coming election, and I have every confidence that the Prime Minister will lead the coalition to victory in the election in May.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank my dozens of staff over the years. We all know in this place that they are like a second family to us. They allow us to shine and they help pick up the pieces when we crumble a little. I'd also like to thank my familyâmy wife, Carolyn, and my children, Eleanor, Barnaby, Felix and Aureliaâas well as my extended family. We are a tight-knit group. My family have been with me every step of my political career. I volunteered but they were conscripted, yet they supported me willingly and graciously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1993 I have been a backbencher for 10 years and a frontbencher for 16, in cabinet for six years and in the leadership group for 10, in government for 17 and in opposition for nineâwhich is a good balance! That places me as the longest-serving non-Labor member of the House of Representatives for South Australia since Federation. Four prime ministers have appointed me to their executives, and prime ministers Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison chose me to be their Leader of the House. I am going to miss the stage of the dispatch box, which gives you some amateur thespianism. Some of my favourites include 'a bloodied dagger masquerading as a speech', from the member for Grayndler; 'I'd back the member for Corio in a fast-moving butterknife fight anytime'âI assume he won that butterknife fight; and 'I fixed it'. I thank Sky for giving me a moniker that I have not been able to shake!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister for Defence and Minister for Defence Industry, I have been responsible for delivering the $200 billion build-up of Australia's military capability, the largest in Australia's peacetime history, which, at the same time, we have used to fundamentally reshape our strategic industrial base. These are the largest Navy, Air Force, Army and cyberprojects in 75 years. And, with the other members of the National Security Committee, I created the Pacific step-up to support Australia's strategic position in the South Pacific. Whoever follows me in this role will be the luckiest person in the government. To be a Minister for Defence in the Defence portfolio is to see Australians at their best. Our Australian Defence Force, and all who enable them to use their capability, are one of the greatest attributes of our country's history and our national character.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond the Defence portfolio, I am proud to have delivered the National Innovation and Science Agenda, to have reformed the national curriculum, to have introduced compulsory literacy and numeracy testing for Australian teaching graduates and to have expanded phonics teaching in remote schools in northern Australia with Noel Pearson. But I am particularly grateful that the youth mental health initiative that I created in 2006, headspace, has gone on to thrive and become a fixture in the mental health sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a few weeks my political career comes to an end. Franklin Roosevelt said a long time ago:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have tried to keep that creed as my lodestar throughout my career because I have had a fortunate life. I don't have a log-cabin story like so many people in this placeâalthough I did once have to get my own lemon for a gin and tonic! That may or may not qualify, Mr Speaker! As the psalms say: of those to whom much is given, much is expected. I have always believed that those who have had great opportunities have a responsibility to work to give others the same opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues on all sides of the House. I once described the House of Representatives as being my natural habitat; you are all my fellow species in this unnatural place! This place brings out the best in us and it brings out the worst in us. I have seen some truly dreadful people come through here over the last quarter of a century. But I have seen many more outstanding people, including my current colleagues. Something drives us all to get here. In most cases, it is a fierce competition internally within our parties and then in the campaign. But we are driven on nonetheless because, my friends, we know, each one of us, that to get the chance to influence the society in which we live, to make a difference in the lives of our fellow citizens, is worth the sacrifices. To be part of politics is to be part of history, and no-one can take that away from any one of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For decades I have carried a little card around in my wallet that has written on it these lines that Plutarch once wrote about Pericles in the lives of the Athenians:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Virtue in action immediately takes such hold of a man that he no sooner admires a deed than he sets out to follow in the steps of the doer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've all followed in the footsteps of great deed doers, men and women who have assisted Australians to build a great nation. As the member for Warringah is fond of saying, you win the lottery of life when you are born in Australia, and everyone around the world knows it. That didn't happen by accident; it happened because of good governments and good men and women trying to do their best. I've relished the opportunity to attempt great deeds in the one forum that in our democracy allows every Australian the chance to do so, the House of Representatives. Thank you, goodbye and good luck.</span>

                  <a href="DYW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  Mr Speaker, on indulgenceâfor years at every election a conversation that goes through the Labor Party has been, 'Can we stop Pyne from winning Sturt?' This was not the preferred method, I have to say. The Leader of the House is someone who has always loved the parliament. There will be times when, for all of us, the debate gets vicious because the issues we are dealing with are real. But I think the Leader of the House has probably been better than almost any of us at having moments where a bit of grace and a bit of levity is thrown in. He referred to the 'stage' of this parliament. I don't think anyone sees it as a stage quite the way the Leader of the House does and I don't think anyone uses it that way quite as effectively. I should let the Leader of the House know that I had organised todayâand they are still up thereâthe scriptwriter and cast of the play <span style="font-style:italic;">How</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> to Rule t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he World</span>, which is actually set here. I thought they could treat this as an audition! There are a couple of roles for your next career that would be spot onâabsolutely spot on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are critical, and because of our roles on the front line you get people who don't know the other being deeply critical. I always respond with respect to the Leader of the House by quoting <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Shawshank Redemption</span>, where someone is critical of a character called Brooks, and Morgan Freeman responds, 'Brooks ain't no bug; he's just institutionalised.' There is also a point about the walls around us: 'First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them.' I wish you well. We really wish you well, whatever the next part of your career involves.</span>
              </p>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  I'll just make a couple of remarks. I don't want to detain the House. Christopher and I have been friends for a long, long time. Before we met, I was told that I needed to hate him. I obviously found that impossible. We became friends. We've shared a lot together over the yearsâthe ups and downs of politics and the challenges that all of us face in here. The Manager of Opposition Business made a very important point: through that, the member for Sturt has never lost his grace and he has certainly never lost his sense of humour, even under the most incredible pressure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You referred to Labor trying to win Sturt. In 2007, they probably had their best chance. In fact, Channel 9 shredded you on election night, didn't they? They'd put you through the shredder. The count was occurring. It was very late in the evening, after Prime Minister Howard had conceded. There were obviously mixed feelings in my electorate. My supporters were thrilled that we'd retained the seat with a strong margin but were obviously disappointed with the overall result. I think probably because of the time difference, Christopher, you rang me quite late. There were about four or five people left and we were cleaning up. I saw your name come up on the phone and I hit the speaker button and all we heard was, 'I'm alive!' I think it was about five minutes to 12. I thought, in those circumstances, that really summed it up. Congratulations. We won't be seeing you here, but your friends will see you around. We really do wish you the best in the next chapter of your life.</span>

On Tuesday, I understand that members of the coalition held events in Parliament House, the people's house, of up to $800 a seat for the purpose of political fundraising. May I ask that you please inform the House whether there are any rules, guidelines or restrictions on using the people's house as a venue to raise funds for political parties?</span>

It's on the members and senators portal. On page 6âI'll table a copy for the benefit of the memberâit specifically sets out that political and other fundraising events are indeed allowed, and all of the costs associated with them are obviously met by the people holding the events. That's been in the policy for a long time. These events have occurred in the House the whole time I've been here, which is a long time.</span>

I was listening to the radio this morning, and there was a bit of commentary about the fact that this week in Australia, this budget week, really treats the Australian budget in a way that you don't often see overseas. There are many other countries with similar sorts of democracies that don't stop for the week to see what's going to be in the budget, with the speculation, the reveal, the speculation about the budget reply, the reveal and the follow-up for days to come.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that, during this fiscal festival, it's worth going through a few other numbers. We've seen the budget numbers from the government, but there are a few numbers that they didn't want to share with Australians. They didn't want to remind people of the six years of cuts and chaos, of 2,034 days of a government that cares only about itselfâone that's happy to appoint its mates to jobs as they rush out the door, without thinking about the jobs and working conditions and pay of ordinary Australians. They didn't want to remind you of the seven ministers or former ministers who are jumping ship at this election.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They didn't want to remind you of the fact that 30 per cent of Liberal women have complained about bullying in the Liberal Party. They didn't want to remind you that 80 per cent of the coalition party room are blokes. In fact, I found one number particularly interesting: after the next election, it is very possible that there will be more men named Andrew in the House of Representatives than there will be Liberal women.</span>

Threeâthat's the number of votes by which the member for Dickson missed out on becoming Prime Minister. Three votes! Imagine the country! Twelve hours, or about 12 hoursâthat's how long the budget lasted before they were releasing version 2 with the updated figures in it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three hundred and seventy-three and a half billion dollarsâ$373Â½ billion! That's net debtâthe net debt that has doubled under those opposite. Isn't it phenomenal to have a Prime Minister who gets up to the despatch box, day after day, talking about debt! He was the Treasurer when net debt doubled. Gross debt has crashed through half a trillion dollars, to $560 billionâalso more than doubleâon the watch of those opposite.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One point six billion dollarsâthat's a number that we are familiar with. That's the underspend in the National Disability Insurance Scheme. And how stomach-turning is it to have the Prime Minister telling us today that the reason for this underspend is because there isn't demandâ'This is a demand-driven system; there's no demand'! Seventy-seven thousand people have missed out on a National Disability Insurance Scheme package in this year alone because of the delays in processing packages. And this underspend of $1.6 billion comes on top of last year's underspend of $3.4 billion. That's about $6 billion of underspend in the National Disability Insurance Scheme to date. And do you know why? It's because they capped the number of staff at the National Disability Insurance Agency. It's because they've been underpaying for services in this sector, causing many disability service providers to threaten to leave the sectorâto shut up shop.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's a number that contrasts with that: $80 billion; $80 billion is what they tried to give away to the top end of town in tax cutsâthe tax cuts to multinationals and the big banks that those opposite voted for 12 times. Well, 12 times plays 26 times; 26 times is the number of times that those opposite voted against a banking royal commission, including the Prime Minister, including the Treasurer, including all of those on the front bench and including all of those on the backbench. Twenty-six times they voted against a banking royal commission. In the face of all the evidence from all of the victims about all of the problems, they kept voting against it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventy-seven dollarsâ$77 is what people who rely on Sunday and public holiday penalty rates are losing from their pay packets. So, here we have those opposite boasting about a $5 a week tax cut when people are losing $77 a week from their penalty rates, with the support and complicity of those opposite and their enthusiastic applause. In fact, we've had those opposite saying low wages are a deliberate part of their economic strategy. They've confessedâ700,000 workers are having their penalty rate cuts. Eight times those opposite voted for those penalty rate cuts. We've got the slowest wage growth on record and every single prediction that those opposite have made for a faster rate of wages growth has been proved wrong. Twenty-seven times they have forecast faster wage growth and 27 times they have failed to deliver that faster wage growthâ1.8 million Australians unemployed or underemployed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the cuts. We've seen the chaos from those opposite. We've seen the fact that hospitals have been cut, universities have been cut, schools have been cut, TAFE has been cut, vocational education has been cut and aged care has been cut. We've seen 1.3 million Australians say that they skip getting basic health care, because they can't afford it. When it comes to energy policyâthe cost of power, power bills, pollutionâwe've seen 13 energy policies from those opposite, and we still don't have one that works. We've seen 128,000 older Australians waiting for a home care package.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a pretty bad set of numbers in anybody's books. But there is an alternative. You'll hear an alternative tonight from the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, who has for six years led a united and disciplined team focused on delivering for ordinary Australiansâstronger wages, better working conditions, better hospitals and schools, TAFEs and universities and an economy that works for everyone. You've seen already the commitments that we've made in education, and you'll see moreâ$14 billion extra for our public schools. Those opposite have confessed to the cuts by restoring funding to Catholic and independent schoolsâand good luck; we support that. But they haven't funded our public schools. Two out of three of all Australian children go to public schools. There is a $14 billion difference between their proposal and our proposal. Every Australian parent can look at our Fair Go for Schools website and see how much extra their school getsâhundreds of thousands, and more than a million in some cases, over the next three years alone. There will be universal access to preschool for three- and four-year-olds, because we know that the best education systems in the world invest early. That's when brain development is happeningâwe know that. From those opposite: one more year of preschool.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to TAFE and universities, there are 150,000 fewer apprentices and trainees today than when those opposite came to office. We'll investâmore apprentices and more investment in TAFE. An extra 200,000 young Australians will get the opportunity to go to university. So, yes, there's a very grim set of numbers from those opposite. But there is an alternativeâan optimistic, uplifting alternative that you'll hear more about tonight and in the coming weeks as we head to the polls. I ask Australians to consider these two alternatives: a chaotic, dysfunctional, divided coalition or a united, strong and determined Labor Party.</span>

Anyway, what I'd like to say about Mr Pyne is that he gave me some great advice when I first arrived and at times during the course of my parliamentary life. He's also given me other titbits that have been helpful, as I am sure he has given many people in the Liberal-National coalition. Hats off to him, and I wish him all the best in his future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition does have a plan. It's right there for everyone to see. It's a public document. Everyone knows about it. We have a plan. Australia is one of the best countries in the world to live, work and raise a family. The Prime Minister is right: in Australia, if you have a go, you'll get a go under a Liberal-National government. The Morrison government is working to keep our economy strong, keep Australians safe and keep Australians together without increasing taxes. We have a plan for Australiaâone that will build a stronger economy and ensure we continue delivering for Australia. Those opposite might not have learnt to read our budget, as we saw in question time following the budget, but our plan was shown in our budget. It's a surplus budget with heavy investment in ensuring that Australians are safe, that our economy remains strong and that we continue to build in Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan for a stronger economy includes tax relief to encourage and reward working Australians. People deserve to keep in their pockets more of the money that they earn. In my electorate of Swan, our plan to lower taxation will benefit more than 75,000 people, thanks to the tax relief we have legislated. Our plan for lower taxes for working Australians will benefit over 10 million Australians, with more than 4.5 million individuals estimated to receive the maximum benefit for the 2018-19 income year. Our little book that we've got here talks about Labor's tax bill. I'll just quote to you from it.</span>

                  </a>  Labor wants higher income tax. Once our full plan comes to effect, 94 per cent of taxpayers will pay no more than 30c in the dollar. Income taxes under Labor would be higher. Labor has said it would cut our legislated tax relief in half, increasing income taxes by $70 million. Further, in the 2018-19 budget, we have announced $158 million of additional personal income tax relief. Former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating has described the Shorten tax hike as 'too punitive a level where the state is confiscating almost half of peopleâs income over $180,000'.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan is to continue backing small businesses every step of the way, as they are the engine room of our economy. I know this as I was a small-business man for 25 years. Without small business, there would be no Australia for any government to have a plan. Those opposite don't have a plan for Australian businesses. They instead want the CFMMEU and their union mates to come in and take control. They even oppose the fast rail link to Geelong. They demonise business owners at every step. They think of them as being big, fat, greedy cats when, at the end of the day, what almost all of them do is risk their own assets and their own family lives and always they have paid at the end. As someone who's spent 25 years in business, I understand that, and many of my colleagues on my side of the chamber have been through those experiences as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also told that we should always leave things better than we find them. This is an important value for not only me but all Australians. How can we ensure that Australia continues to be the great country it is? We do that by fixing the budget, because fiscal responsibility means we can ensure that we can provide funding for all essential services without putting at risk services and without future generations having to pay back debt. Those opposite have no plan for fiscal responsibility. At every election they say, 'You can trust us on the budget,' like the Leader of the Opposition's on-again off-again friend Kevin Rudd, who described himself as a fiscal conservative, did before the 2007 election. The fact is that, after six years of chaos, Labor left Australia with a broken budget, a damaged economy and a serious mess to fix. The key facts are that between 2008-09 and 2012-13 Labor delivered deficits totalling $191 billion, and Labor left additional projected deficits of $123 billion over the next four years. The Treasury projected that the budget would be in deficit for the next 10 years. This would have meant 16 unbroken years of deficits if Labor had stayed in power. As we heard from the Prime Minister, if you vote for Labor once, you pay for it for a decade. That is a very true story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In practice, what have Labor done? They have done nothing. There have been nothing but deficits for 12 years, which they created. They haven't delivered a surplus in government since 1990. The last time they delivered a surplus was when Allan Border was the captain of the Australian cricket team, my 26-year-old son wasn't alive yet, and the West Coast Eagles hadn't won an AFL premiership. Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, I know you're from a different state, but it resonates for a lot of people. People can put a time line through that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Keeping Australians safe is something that this government has as an absolute priority. It is front and centre in our future plan for Australia. Those opposite talk a big game, but they're beholden to the Greens and the Labor Left on this. They slashed our Defence budget when last in government to rates lower than 1939. They couldn't stop the boatsâand they told us we couldn't stop the boatsâso they turned their failed minister for immigration into their shadow Treasurer. If those opposite couldn't secure Australia's borders, how can we put them in charge of Australia's economy? Stopping the boats is more important than just ensuring Australia's border security is in the hands of our agencies. In fact, it allows us to spend more on the services all Australians rely on. As we know, $16 billion was blown by those opposite on border protection. That is just $2 billion shy of the amount in drugs we have listed on the PBS since coming to government. And we can't forget the fact that over 1,200 lives were lost at sea under their border protection policy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our budget, we are providing more than half a billion dollars of new funding for our Australian Federal Police to keep Australians safe. This includes funding to enhance our ability in counterterrorism in all forms, and it will help ensure that Australians, anywhere in Australia, are actually safe. Since being in government, we've cancelled the visas of over 4,150 foreign nationals who have committed serious crimes, including murderers, rapists and child sex offenders. That reminds me: this government introduced a bill for mandatory sentencing of paedophiles, rapists and child sex offenders. Guess who voted against it. Can anyone guess who voted against it?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With a stronger economy, the government are delivering more funding for schoolsâan extra $37.6 billion over a decade, to 2029, which is a 62 per cent funding increase per student. In my electorate, schools received an average increase of 70 per cent of their funding. Our government are embarking on an infrastructure spend that has not been seen in the lifetime of anyone in this House. They have played the game for healthâthey would like to own that areaâbut here I have an article, which I will table. It says, 'Bentley Hospital loses $10m upgrade funds'. The WA state Labor government took it out of their operating budget. It's all here in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canning Times</span>, in September 2017. What happened? Recently, the Leader of the Opposition and his candidate turned up at Bentley Hospital and announced $10 million of funding for the Bentley Hospital, just to replace the money that WA state Labor had taken out. The hypocrisy of that is well known to everyone in the electorate. They'll see through that, as they will see through the Labor Party having no plan for our economy and no plan for the future of Australia, as the coalition does. I will table that now for you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HWM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  A whole heap more election cons and a whole heap of stuff locking in Liberal cuts from their budget. Their budget was one of the biggest cons I've seen in this place in 11 years: a whole heap of smoke and mirrors hide that they have doubled the debt. They absolutely have doubled the debt, and they try to come in here and blame others for their mismanagement of the budget and the economy. What they have done in their budget is actually lock in their cuts to hospitals and to schools. That is what they've done. You absolutely have locked in your cuts to hospitals and to schools in this budget. There are schools in Tasmania who know about these cuts. There is a $52 million cut from schools and students in Tasmania and an $11 million cut from our hospital systems in my home state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then, of course, we've seen this alleged surplus. We know this is built on the underspend in the NDIS, the National Disability Insurance Schemeâ$1.6 billion. We had the Prime Minister try to convince everybody that this is a demand-driven system and that, if the demand was there, it would all be okay. I'm going to quote Senator Eric Abetz in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Tasmania</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n</span>. Senator Abetz and I normally don't agree on very much, let me assure you of that, but he is one of my constituents and I do represent him in this place. Senator Abetz raised some questions about the NDIS in our local paper because he was so concerned about it. There are some participants in Tasmania who cannot get the services they need because of this government's bungled implementation of the NDIS. We have a builder in Tasmania who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Since July 2015 we have been quoting and providing services for the NDIA. Nearly four years later, we have not seen one NDIS project go ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you about the people we're talking about here. As Senator Abetz identified, we're talking about a teenager who's six foot seven and who needs to be lifted and carried to get inside their home. We're talking about a participant in Kingston in my electorate who is a teenage childâan NDIS participant of three yearsâwho still has to be carried upstairs to the living area. These are people living with disability and their families who need services that they can't get, and you have an underspend that's propping up the alleged surplus that you're claiming you're going to get in a year's time. For the Prime Minister to say there's no demand when his own senator knows that there's a demand is just appalling, quite frankly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then, of course, we have the situation with TAFEs and apprenticeships. I heard another Tasmanian senator on the radio earlier in the week talking about how great it isâ'Employment is going terrifically; a lot of great jobs are going on in Tasmania.' There have been 2,900 full-time jobs lost in Tasmania since June last year. Tasmania currently has almost 2,000 fewer apprentices than it did just a few years ago. That's because of this government and the $3 billion that they took out of apprenticeships and TAFE. That $3 billion taken out of apprenticeships and TAFE is the reason there are fewer apprentices in Australia today. You have to take some responsibility for where we are today with those apprenticeships and young people not being able to get into TAFEs and into apprenticeships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have teenage sons. They have a lot of mates. All of them are struggling to get into TAFE and into apprenticeships. Those positions are simply not there, because of what you on that side of the House have doneâbecause of this governmentâand it is not okay. And yet they want to come into this place and they want to go on radio and on TV to talk about how wonderful everything is. Well, it's not wonderful for some people. It might be for their mates at the big end of town, but it is not wonderful for a lot of Australians out there today. Your hubris and the way you're going on about what a wonderful budget it is and what a great set of numbers it is shows that you are not listening and talking to people on the ground in your electorates. That's what it says.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my shadow portfolio of Ageing, to have people come and say there are another 10,000 aged-care packages in the budget when there is not one new home care package in the budget is actually outrageous because what you're doing is telling all of those 128,000 people currently waiting on a home care waiting list that, somehow or another, some package is going to miraculously appear for them and they won't have to wait that 12 months to two years that some of them are having to wait. You are giving false hope, and that is not okay. We heard today in question time about a 93-year-old who has been waiting. I'm getting stories of a lot of people in their 90s who have been waiting more than a year for a home care package that they have been approved for. You have done nothing about that waiting list in this budget. Everybody knows that this is just smoke and mirrors. Everybody knows that this budget is a con. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="230531" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUCHHOLZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Roads and Transport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:54</span>):  On indulgence, before I talk about our outline for our plan for the future and how it contrasts with those who sit opposite and seek to run our country, I'd first like to associate myself with the words of the member for Sturt. I have learnt a lot from the member for Sturt in his time. His comment that there are some appalling people in this place is apt. Do you know what? We learn from those people. We learn from those people on how we don't want to conduct ourselves. The member for Sturt's understanding and knowledge of the standing orders is nothing short of inspirational. He is a 26-year veteran of this place. He has maintained his humour, his sharp edge, his 'lovable larrikin' persona. He has cut through with virtually every demographic of the Australian public. I wish him well in whatever he chooses to do. His contribution to this place is noteworthy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now come to the upcoming election and the MPI before us today around changing Australia. Who do we trust to run the budget as we move into the future? Someone who can produce a $7.1 billion surplus. We've heard other speakers talk about the last time Labor produced a surplusâand it's been some time. The bleeding-heart excuses come out: 'Oh, there was a GFC.' But the reality is that you need to have fiscal discipline to be able to bring about surpluses. The Australian public know that the best side of this House to manage future surpluses is the coalition side. We are renowned for coming in after Labor and fixing up their mess and getting us back into place. I want to address this as briefly as I can for those in the gallery. You'll hear rhetoric from the other side that we've come in and doubled the deficit.</span>
              </p>

                  <a href="230531" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BUCHHOLZ:</span>
                  </a>  Doubled the debtâI thank the member for Griffith. When you take the Treasury books, there are contracts that the privilege of government will sign into, and they'll be contracts for up to four years. We took office in 2013. When you come into governmentâwhichever side it isâthere is expenditure that has been committed to, so you are locked in. In 2013 we were committed to expenditure because we inherited poor mistakes from those on the other side. During this campaign, you will hear those on the other side say that we have doubled the deficit. I want you to understand why that came about. The member for Swan was an electrician before he came here. Another bloke here has got country in western New South Wales. That bloke up there, the member for Moore, is a land developer. They're all businesspeople. They run balance sheets. They know what it's like to lie awake in bed at night knowing they've got a wages bill to meet the next morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So you're trying to contrast who's got the best plan for Australiaâthose with the skill set on this side or those on the other side. Those on the other side are openly not necessarily business oriented people, so they'll play the big game. I take you back to the last election: those on the other side said that we were going to sell Medicare. There will be other claims made by those on the other side as we go into the upcoming election. There will be scare campaigns. They will absolutely come, and they will be thick and they will be fast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian public, when we go into this election, will have the very clear choice to trust a government that has a proven economic benefit. We have a plan for Australia, we have a plan for infrastructure and we have a plan for families. You'll hear those on the other side talk about cuts to hospitals. When those on the other side left office in 2013, they were spending $69 million on Moreton Bay District Hospital in my area. Today, we spend $140 millionâjust on double that amount of moneyâand it is forecast to go to $210 million. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  The matter of public importance today is the government's failure to provide a plan for Australia's future. We have had six years of cuts and chaos. We have had three Prime Ministers, two Deputy Prime Ministers and no planâno plan delivered, no plan for the future, just cuts, cuts, cuts. It is absolutely disappointing that we in this place have had six wasted years when there are hospitals and schools that are facing further cuts. We've had a range of different programs. They attempted to cut the pension. They attempted to cut a whole range of different services that we had to spend our time here stopping. And, of course, when it comes to families, we've had so many cuts and disappointments as a result of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear the government talking about franking credits a lot. In fact, the member for Goldstein is here. He loves to talk about franking credits. What we don't hear about is Australia's future and the plans they have for families. We don't hear much from this government about families, and it's no wonder, because, when we look at the early years, this government has abandoned families. They have let families down, and this continues in the budget in front of us today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many failures, including that one in four families are worse off as a result of the childcare changes. It is a system that has made providers become debt collectors. They now have to wear costs if families are found not to have the right amount of entitlement to child care. Not only do they have to wear costs; they have to recover that money on behalf of the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've made it harder for regional and remote early learning services to stay open. It is very interesting that the National Party stood by while the budget based funded services that were in their electorates were demolished by this government. It has been a very disappointing time, especially given what we're seeing for the future of Australia's preschoolers. There was an opportunity for the government to actually commit to Australian preschool, to recognise that the two years before school are really important and to invest in them. Labor has been very clear about its plans. We plan to give two years of before-school fundingâuniversal access to both three- and four-year-oldsâwhen it comes to preschool.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very, very important measure that is supported universally by experts across this area and is actually being implemented right around the world. Labor has a clear plan, and there was an opportunity for the government to fund preschool in this budget. If they didn't want to support our three-year-olds' preschool, they could at least have supported permanent funding for four-year-olds. But they failed to do that. They provided a one-year extension for preschools and nothing in the forward estimates, and they've cloaked it with excuses about participation rates. Well, we've heard from the Department of Education in Queensland, which said the Commonwealth never tried to seriously address participation rates. They've been using this for the last three years as an excuse as to why they couldn't provide permanent funding, but they've done nothing about it. It is just a ploy, because they've never been committed to funding universal access to preschool, and that is clear to see in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, this has an impact in the real world. There's news for the coalition here. It provides families with uncertainty about access to early education. It provides uncertainty for centres. It provides uncertainty for those educators and teachers wanting a career. Year-by-year funding is not the way to run a system. But it is not surprising from this government, which has been completely chaotic, completely obsessed by itself, completely uninterested in the Australian people and Australian families and more ambitious for itself than it is for the rest of Australia. So there is going to be a clear decisionâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  I was hoping to finish this parliamentary year in the spirit of the member for Sturt's remarks, a spirit in which we come together and celebrate the achievements of our great country and what we seek to do as a nation to recognise it. I don't dispute that whoever is in government aspires, hopes and wishes to do the best for the Australian people. We can disagree on the policy and the detail, but always there is the aspiration to do the right thing. Sadly, this has been denied us by the opposition, who have put forward this patently ridiculous matter of public importance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This matter of public importance goes to the heart of why I'm a Liberal. It goes to the foundations of our values and, yes, a modern Liberal vision for this country. It is one where we understand the importance of intergenerational equity and the social contract, one where we understand that we can give no greater gift to future generations than the stewardship and inheritance of a sound economy and a society that's united in an environment that cares for them so that they can live out their lives freely. That's the core and the focus of what this government has sought to do. It's why we have made getting the budget back into black so important, because every dollar of debt that is incurred means taxes for future generations to pay. Every dollar of debt incurred by the Labor Party and their agenda denies future generations their freedom. That's why we have made it such a priority, because it enables future generations to live their lives freely and makes sure they don't pay more than their fair share of tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We made sure that we put the budget into surplus so that in the Goldstein electorate alone 24,077 people are receiving the low- and medium-income tax offset. Getting the budget into surplus means that 11,000 age pensioners in Goldstein are going to see support through the energy supplement and, of course, the regular indexation of pensions. Getting the budget into surplus is so critical because we're then able to fund essential services at record levels. I know that in Goldstein alone we have seen significant increases in hospital funding. Of course, public hospital funding in Victoria has increased by 80 per cent under this government. We've seen an increase in the GP bulk-billing rate to 66 per cent in Goldstein. And, of course, we've seen massive funding increases for public schools across the entire electorate as well as seeing many people enjoy things like the childcare package. This is complemented by tax reform to diminish the obligation, the tax burden, that future generations will have, so that they can be successful and support themselves and their families, buy their own home and secure their future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thinking about the future is core to everything that we on this side of the chamber stand for, and it is everything that is disregardedâfor the indulgence of today, without any sense of probity or responsibilityâby those who sit on the opposition benches. It is one of the reasons this country is always better off when I am sitting over here and you are sitting over there. What we are able to do is make sure that we have a situation where we can support those people who have a goâwho stand up, who want to employ people, who create a small business and the opportunities for othersâbecause the greatest contribution that anybody in this country can make is to stand on their own two feet so they can help others do the same and help those who are unable to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're doing with the small and medium businesses in Goldstein, the 24,435 who are going to get tax relief under this budget, is backing them every single step of the way. If you had the honesty and decency to repeal this matter of public importance, you would acknowledge that there are thousands of businesses in your electorates that would enjoy those benefits as well. There are 24,500 small and medium businesses in Goldstein that will benefit from the government's instant asset write-off. That will flow through the whole economy. It will flow through the whole of society and make this country a better place.</span>

                  <a href="248006" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  It is such a pleasure to follow the member for Goldstein. I do hold him in high regard, though obviously not as high as the regard in which he holds himself. He is a fine member of the Australian parliament but one who is, sadly, quite wrong about most of the things he addresses in this place. It has also been a pleasure, of course, to listen to the other coalition speakers in this MPI debateâagain, quite wrong, but somewhat entertaining.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have today is a genuine matter of public importance about this government's failure to have a real plan for the future of this nation. Nowhere has that been more evident than in this week's budgetâthe greatest con job of a budget in many, many years; a con job of a budget that seeks to tell the Australian people that this coalition government will be delivering for them, when in reality only a Labor government will deliver an economy that works for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The young people of Australia have been rightly complaining about the fact that there is very little in this budget for them. The youth unemployment rate remains in double digits, including in my own electorate, yet there is nothing from this government in terms of a vision for the future of work for young Australians. There is nothing in this budget that talks about what they're going to do in relation to this unemployment rate. Of course, they have tried to suggest that they will be promoting more apprenticeships, but the number of apprenticeships they have raised in this budget, that they have said they will promote, isn't even enough to cover the shortfall in apprenticeships that has occurred since this coalition government took office. Young Australians want to know what the government is going to do for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Never has the lack of a youth minister been so evident as in this week's budget. The government is forgetting young people. Young people aren't even featuring on this government's radar, and I think the young people of Australia are going to make very clear that, if the government doesn't care about them, come election day they will certainly not care about this coalition government. I certainly look forward to young Australians en masse standing up and speaking out and raising the issues that matter to them come this federal election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example of the failure for young people is that there was nothing said this week in the budget about the government's failed Youth Jobs PaTH Program, a program that since its inception actually has had fewer than 4,000 young Australians go through an internship and get a job. That is 4,000 across the country. I'm not talking about in a single electorate; this is across the country. When there is 50,000 long-term unemployed young people in this country, they have every right to be disappointed in this government's failure when it comes to youth unemployment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to say in relation to this budget and this week's demonstration of a failure of a plan that it is incredibly disappointing to see the failure to even admit the ongoing, locked-in cuts to public funding for public schoolsâ$14 billion in cuts. That is $14 billion across this country. It is an absolute disgrace that the government is failing to reverse these cuts to public school funding. In my own electorate, no matter what school I go to, people want to see better funding for public schools. Whether it is the biggest of the public schools in my electorate, the state high school, or the smallest, they want to see much better support for schools funding, because our kids deserve a world-class education no matter what school they go to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also gravely concerned about the failure of the government to address their cuts to hospital funding. In my electorate alone, there's $26.7 million in cuts to hospitals, including Princess Alexandra, the Mater Hospital and the Queensland Children's Hospital. It's not good enough. People in Queensland deserve to have hospitals funded properly. It will take a Labor government to restore the funding that the LNP has cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, the most disappointing thing out of this budgetâand it is a crowded fieldâwas the failure to commit real funding to congestion-busting infrastructure in my electorate of Griffith. There is no federal money for Cross River Rail. Yet again there is no federal money for this transformative project that is absolutely necessary to bust traffic congestion in Queensland. Labor has committed $2.2 billion of federal money to go to this project if we form government. The Deputy Premier has called for it, the Premier has called for it, and we will deliver it if we are elected come May.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also gravely disappointed by the failure to commit funding to the Coorparoo-Cavendish Road level crossing removal project. They know it's important, we know it's important; why has the coalition, once again, failed to deal with this major south side traffic snarl? There must be a change come May.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  Only the Morrison government has a plan for a strong economy. It's a plan that busts congestion, lowers taxes and eases cost-of-living pressures on Australians and their families. And only the Morrison government will guarantee the essential services that all Australians rely on, like hospitals and Medicare, because of our plan for a strong economy. And it is a plan that is working.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My local residents in the electorate of Boothby are seeing this firsthand at the Repatriation General Hospital site in Daw Park, in the heart of my electorate. This is a very significant hospital precinct for my local community. It is a place that was closed down by the former state Labor government. All of those oppositeâand there are no South Australians in the chamberâevery single federal member of the Labor opposition who is from South Australia, stood by and let this happen. It was a disgraceful decision and it was yet another broken Labor promise.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Premier Mike Rann said that the Repat hospital would never ever be closed under a Labor government, and yet that's what they did. It devastated my veterans communityâin fact, it devastated the entire veterans community in South Australiaâand it devastated my local community, because not only was it an iconic hospital for our veterans but also it was a general community hospital. So many of my local residents had used it or had family members who had been nursed there as well.</span>

This is a project that I've been working on for years, and I'm so proud to be delivering this for my community. I cannot thank the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, enough for his support, and also the Minister for Health and Wellbeing in South Australia, Stephen Wade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to our strong economic management, the federal government will deliver $30 million in funding for a brain and spinal injury unit at the Repat hospital. This will be state-of-the-art. We will care for people who most need our support in our community there. The federal government will also fund a specialist dementia care unit, and the state government is providing additional funding to make sure that some of the most vulnerable people in our community receive the care and careful attention that they need. Unfortunately, under the previous Labor government in South Australia, we had the Oakden disasterâa scandal that cost people their lives and saw people mistreated terribly by the healthcare system. A lot of these people had dementia, or they had very severe mental health issues. They were all senior Australians. This will not happen at the Repat. We are investing in the very best dementia care on the Repat site, and our most vulnerable residents will never again be out of sight or out of mind. That's what they were under the previous state Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm incredibly proud of what we're doing in the health space, and I'm just going to run through some of the record funding that we're providing for health in our nation. We're investing a record $104 billion in 2019-20, up from $75 billion in 2012-13. That will guarantee Medicare and it will make life-saving medicines and services more accessible and more affordable. It will reduce out-of-pocket costs and strengthen primary care. And we will invest in breakthrough medical research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only our government is increasing Medicare funding by $6 billion, to $30.7 billion in 2022-23. We are also making sure that our hospitals are funded. We are increasing hospital funding by $5 billion, up from $21.7 billion in 2018-19 to $26.2 billion in 2022-23. These are big numbers. We are investing record amounts of money in our hospital system and in our healthcare system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my part of the world, by investing in crucial local roads we are making sure people can actually get to hospital and do so on time and as safely as possible. We are investing in the North-South Corridor, in the Flinders Link rail project, in the Fullarton Road and Cross Road intersection, in the Springbank, Daws and Goodwood roads intersection, and we are fixing Oaklands crossing. I am so proud of our strong economic plan and the things we are delivering for the nation, but particularly for South Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  It is somewhat alarming that here we are on the eve of an election and the matter of public importance before the House is on the government's failure to have any plan for the nation, Indeed, we see there was barely a plan to deliver speakers for the matter of public importance today, so that's a worrying start. But when I listened with great care to the budget coming down on Tuesday night I was also questioning what new measures for Australian women were to be found anywhere in it. I was listening very carefullyâand nothing. And you ask: Really? Seriously? What kind of government thinks it is okay to bring down a budgetâone on the eve of the election; one that it is taking to the Australian peopleâthat ignores 50 per cent of the Australian population and thinks it will get away it? I have news for this government: how do you think you are going to be returned to government when you have no plan to address the gender pay gap, for example, and no plan to address the gross inequities that continue to exist in superannuation?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the minister here doesn't have many women to consult with in the party room, let's face it. There are not many women for you to chat to about these issues and clearly there is no-one in your party room who is capable of standing up and bringing up these issues so as to make sure they are on the table for you to address in government. You have had six years to think about how you might tackle the fact that there's still a massive gender pay gap in Australia, six years to think about how you might address inequities in superannuation, six years to think about how you might deliver paid domestic violence leave for the women of Australia and six years to think about how you might go about restoring penalty ratesâpenalties rates that affect the lowest-paid workers in Australia. And who are the lowest-paid workers in Australia? Australian women. You've had six years to think about how you might invest in and bring us into line with the rest of the OECD on early childhood education. In the budget we gotâwhat was it?âa 12-month reprieve for four-year-olds to have early childhood education. There was nothing beyond a year for that and no mention at all for three-year-olds. This is a government that thinks it is still okay for all Australian kids to be lagging way behind the rest of the OECD when it comes to developing young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the member for Griffith raised a number of issues impacting on young people, but I'll tell you what: the Australian schoolchildren who came to see me during the climate change strikes that took place around the nation are onto you guys. Gosh! They know you have no plan for their future. They know you have no plan to deal with climate change and no plan for energy. Actually, you have had 13 plans; it's just that you can't settle on a plan for energy. No-one in the party room can actually agree on how we tackle things like a national energy policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the issue of trust was raised earlier. I thought: that's right, no plan for delivering integrity into the Commonwealth government anymoreâno plan for a national integrity system; well, not one with any teeth that can actually do anything, that's for sure. What is it that this government is going to the next election with? We all know there are endless scare campaigns in store, banking on the fact that Australian people have very short memories, I thinkâthat somehow the Australian people might forget that you have had six years to stand up and do some serious reform in this country. But, no, you didn't take the opportunity to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You had a budget last Tuesday night that professed to be a plan for infrastructure in Australia. I understand most of it is Albo's plan for infrastructure, now funded by you, which is not bad. But for my electorate? A big zip. There's no money on the table for the Bascawen Street bridge, which I'd written to the Deputy Prime Minister about. I've got a suburb, Wallsend, that gets inundated when it rains. It has had a flood mitigation plan on the table. We sought some moneyâ$3 million to $4 millionâfrom this government to build a plan so the people of Wallsend could have the flood mitigation plan implemented, but there was nothing, absolutely nothing, in the plan for the Bascawen Street bridge. I'm devastated about that. The people of Wallsend will be devastated about that. It's time the government came to grips with the fact that they have nothing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0H" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  As we see the scare campaign for 2019 barely igniting, this is a Labor Party that has scurried around the known horizon of social policy, unable, like a political arsonist, to ignite any kind of scare campaign on health. Nothing is lighting with hospitals. They had a crack at schools but nothing's burning. Then, of course, we heard it was a referendum on wages. We were going to have a referendum in 2019 on wages, with a Labor government promising it would increase everyone's wages and life would be easier, when anyone who has studiedâwhat?âfive minutes of school economics knows that if you could raise wages and improve living standards it would have been done decades ago. There are consequences to artificially raising wages. It causes inflation, and then the wage increases rapidly disappear again. But when you're designing policy intentionally for people who can't tell the difference between truth and lie, you're going to have more and more of these scare campaigns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest. It's been a decade and no Labor opposition has ever come to government without a scare campaign. They've tried one at every frontier on social policy. They enter what is a likely election campaign with absolutely no momentum at all on any scare campaign, which is why each one of the speakers today has jumped up with a different topic, hoping they will get lucky, hoping they will strike that lucky seam where a few agnostic, apathetic or disinterested voters will say, 'Ooh, cuts to something I'm worried about; I'd better vote Labor.' Do you know what? Australians are increasingly waking up to this. They are increasingly waking up to the fact that the best evidence of commitment to education is funding in the forward estimates. We learnt from Prime Minister Julia Gillard that you simply move your funding promises out beyond the four-year forward estimates and you can talk about billions of dollars but never budget for it and never provide for it, and when you slip into opposition weeks later you can say, 'We promised way more than they ever delivered.' It's like a fool catching up with you, offering to double your salary and then vanishing, and then you go and beat up your boss and say, 'Thanks for halving my wage.' This is a Labor government that never follows up with these magnificent numbers. It's a government on the Labor side that mentions these massive figures only weeks before it loses government and then trades on it throughout opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had it on health and hospitals and schools and now we have it in early education. It is exactly and precisely the same circumstance. We've had a measly $200 million committed to three-year-old preschool, but everyone in the early education sector knows you can't deliver three-year-old preschool for less than a billion dollars. Where is the other $800 million? They'll try and strongarm the states, and when they don't get that money the promise will vanish. It's all about being elected and then worrying about the unfulfilled promises once, and if, you're elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Education today can proudly commit to $310 billion, to annual increases of over six per cent for state schools and over five per cent for the independent sector each and every year through to 2016. The best evidence for what the Labor government will do is what their kooky cousins in Queensland Labor do with schools. There is only one party cutting education in Queensland. It's the state Labor government cutting classrooms from Ormiston State School. How do you educate a child when you take away their classroom? How do you deliver STEM and advanced subjects when you're taking away classrooms at the same time? The only party doing that is Queensland Labor. When Queensland Labor had to build classrooms, back under Anna Bligh, they went to wealthy corporations and did dirty dealsâthat's right. It's not a comfortable narrative. Anna Bligh said, 'How much would it cost the private sector to build me seven schools, two of them high schools?' It should have been $340 million off the bottom line. Instead we got a $1.08 billion deal with corporations. Two-thirds of that money is interest to be paid over the next 25 years to wealthy corporations, direct from Labor policy. That's money that should be spent on children, money that should be spent on the curriculum. Butâalas!âwe cannot, in this great place, debate education policy so long as there is one side of politics, called the Labor Party, utterly fixated on the quantum, utterly oblivious and blinded, with a massive scotoma, unable to talk about quality in education because they're fixated on the fictitious numbers that they invent just weeks before they lose government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This nation deserves better than a Labor government that can't deliver on quality schools. It has, in the coalition, secured the futureâback in black, back on track and delivering for Australian parents and their children.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sport is an important part of Australian culture. It has shaped the Australian national identity through events such as the Ashes, the Melbourne Cup and the Australian Open. Australians have come to expect that the sports they watch and participate in are protected from threats, and while Australia has always taken a strong stance against doping, cheating and misconduct in sport, it must be acknowledged that there is more that can be done to prepare for future threats and challenges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is essential that the millions of Australians who participate in sport at every levelâfrom grassroots to the eliteâhave full confidence their sports are better protected from external threats such as doping, drug use, match-fixing and criminal exploitation of athletes and events. Australians should be confident that they can enjoy sports environments free of abuse, discrimination and harassment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature of sports corruption is evolving at an unprecedented rate due to the immense commercialisation of sport and sporting organisations and accelerating technological advancement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sports integrity matters are now beyond the control of any single stakeholder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are complex, globalised and connected, forming a complicated threat matrix exposing vulnerabilities that require a robust and nationally-coordinated response across sports, governments, regulators, the wagering industry, law enforcement and other stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August 2017, the government commissioned the Review of Australia's Sports Integrity Arrangements, as part of the government's ongoing development of the National Sports PlanâSport 2030. The review panel, chaired by the Hon. James Wood AO QC, delivered the <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Review of Australia's Sports Integrity Arrangements</span> (the Wood review) in early 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wood review warns that 'without the presence of a comprehensive, effective and nationally coordinated response capability, the hard earned reputation of sport in this country risks being tarnished' and that beyond the immediate impact of corrupt conduct of the kind identified, a public loss of confidence in the sporting contest has direct consequences for the health, economic, social and cultural benefits that sport generates, and undermines significant investment in sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wood review also identified a critical leadership role for the Commonwealth government by supporting the integrity efforts of sporting organisations in the evolving threat environment, particularly those sports with fewer resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To achieve this outcome, the centrepiece of the Wood review recommendations is the formation of a new agencyâa single body to address sports integrity matters at a national level and ensure that Australia is positioned to effectively respond to escalating integrity risks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new body will be called Sport Integrity Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently in Australia, sports integrity functions are shared between the National Integrity of Sport Unit, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority and Sport Australia. As a result, stakeholders are often required to interact with multiple agencies on matters across the sport integrity spectrum, creating undue regulatory burden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Initially, Sport Integrity Australia will be established to unite the nationally focused sport integrity functions of the NISU, ASADA, and Sport Australia, establishing a single point of responsibility for all sport integrity matters and a single point of reference for all stakeholders, working in close cooperation with states and territories and across the sports sector.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion was developed in response to a proposal from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in their 2018 report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Excluded: the impact of section 44 on Australian democracy</span>. I want to thank, from the outset, the opposition, the parliament, members of the government and members of the committee who worked on this report to ensure that we had a bipartisan arrangement in relation to improvements in the law and improvements to our standing orders here and in the Senate in relation to the administration of section 44 under the Constitution and in the requirements of the electoral processes to ensure that we get a better outcome for the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The joint standing committee proposed that, in addition to legislative changes to require federal election candidates to disclose information about their eligibility to hold office under the Constitution, the House and the Senate also needed to adopt complementary parliamentary processes related to the issues of constitutional qualifications. I think any member that reflected on the passage of events in the last parliament that we've had would agree that there would be a need for improvement related to the issues of constitutional qualification procedures within our chambers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although interim motions were adopted to deal with these issues in each chamber, this replacement motion that I'm proposing today on behalf of the government was developed with the benefit of greater time. It deals more comprehensively with the eligibility issues and ensures greater alignment between the practices of both the House and the Senate to ensure fairness of treatment to all members and senators. A parallel motion, I note, was adopted in the Senate yesterday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion does two things. The motion establishes a process to require public disclosure following discovery of new information after an election. Given that the electoral requirements for nominations now, as the parliament's laws have made clear, require disclosure of section 44 information up-front and transparently on the AEC's website, any new information will be required to be brought forward under this motion to the parliament in an orderly process with the cooperation of members and the Speaker. It's also fair and proposes a fair and orderly process for making referrals to the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns. Members will note that, given the lack of clarity about the procedures for making referrals to the High Court from this chamber, this motion will adopt a standing order change which will allow us to make an orderly referral and ensure there is clarity in future situations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate motion differs from the House motion in one regard: to provide procedures for disclosures by senators who are appointed to fill casual vacancies. Obviously, this is not relevant for members elected via by-elections as they can make their initial disclosures about their qualifications via the Australian Electoral Commission. As per the procedure with a general election, in a by-election candidates will be required to lodge the same information that a lower house candidate will have to nominate at a general election. The motions have bipartisan support, as I've stated. They've been shared with the chairs of the parliamentary committees that would have roles in administering these motions. They include the House Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the motion to the House and simply record again my thanks to the opposition, the parliament, the Senate, the chairs and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It is important that, at this juncture, we provide clarity to members, with an election imminent, and that we understand and know the procedures. We listened to the outcomes of the High Court cases that have made clear the High Court's view on section 44, and I can say confidently to the Australian people, to the gallery and to the parliament that this government has listened very carefully and has moved to adopt modern and relevant changes to the law surrounding nominations regarding section 44, and that the motions that change standing orders in our House will also provide clarity to members in future parliaments.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HARTSUYKER:</span>
                  </a>  I had the honour of participating in the delegation, which was led by the President of the Senate and also included the members for Lalor and the member for Perth. The APPF is an assembly of members of national parliaments in the Asia-Pacific region and has met each year since 1993 to discuss matters of mutual concern. The forum draws together parliamentarians from countries in Asia and those in and bordering the Pacific Ocean on both the western and eastern sides. Those countries include Australia's major trading and strategic partners and those with which we have strong social and cultural ties. It remains in Australia's interests to build and sustain relationships with parliamentarians from these countries and to maintain institutional links between our parliaments. Each conference is structured around a number of plenary sessions and working groups and a drafting committee that considers a range of resolutions arising from the discussions. Participating countries submit draft resolutions that form the basis of the discussion sessions, and subsequent conference resolutions are finalised through a consensus. The sessions were under the recurring themes of political and security matters, economic and trade matters, and regional cooperation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The four draft resolutions forwarded by the Australian delegation reflected the interests of delegation members. Senator Ryan spoke on combating terrorism and transnational crime in the region. The member for Lalor spoke on the importance of men and women having equal access to education and technical training in order to achieve sustainable growth; the member for Perth spoke about the need for parliaments of the region to work together to address the impacts of climate change; and I spoke on the need for the region to have strong institutions that can promote trade and investment growth. In particular, I noted the potential of e-commerce to allow microbusinesses in rural areas to market directly into major centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The President of the Senate was also co-chair of the drafting committee that reviewed the consensus resolutions and placed its imprimatur on their final form. The Australian delegation was relatively small in comparison with delegations from some countries. Nonetheless, we submitted draft resolutions on all themes, spoke in each plenary session and were active participants in all the working groups and on the drafting committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">APPF meetings provide an ideal opportunity for Australian parliamentarians to meet their colleagues from around the region and to develop strong networks while discussing matters of mutual concern. On behalf of the delegation, I would like to thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for assistance with briefing papers for the forum meeting and for the support provided in Cambodia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we must all thank our very generous hosts, the Senate and National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The forum organisers went to great lengths to ensure that the forum progressed smoothly and was a success. Members will be interested to know that the Presiding Officers have agreed that Australia will host the next annual APPF meeting, in January next year, here at Parliament House. This cements Australia's long involvement with the APPF, the parliament having hosted the forum in the year 2000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia participation in the APPF has enjoyed ongoing bipartisan support and the active involvement of both members and senators over the decades. We look forward to senators and members of all parties coming together again to represent the Australian parliament at the 28th APPF, here in Canberra in January 2020. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ZIMMERMAN:</span>
                    </a>  by leaveâI'm pleased to be able to table the health committee's report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Bedtime reading: inquiry into sleep health awareness in Australia</span>. While there are many committee reports tabled in this place that might inadvertently provoke a good night's sleep, this is one report where it's actually our objective!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sleep is a fundamental human need and, along with nutrition and physical exercise, is one of the pillars of good health. And yet currently four in every 10 Australians are not getting adequate sleep. While many people use limited sleep as a badge of honour, the reality is that very few people can operate optimally on little sleep. As a result of not prioritising sleep, many people are placing their health at risk as well as reducing their productivity at work. In 2016 and 2017, inadequate sleep was estimated to contribute to 3,017 deaths in Australia and to cost the economy $66.3 billion annually, mostly due to decreased productivity and reduced health and wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An emerging issue is the potential for sleep to be affected by smartphones and internet usage. In particular, many children are having their sleep continually disrupted by their smartphones, and that can have negative impacts on childhood development, behaviour and performance during the day and at school. There is a strong message for parents in this report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people experience inadequate sleep due to the presence of a sleep disorder, with obstructive sleep apnoea, or OSA, being one of the most prevalent. Without treatment, OSA can have serious health impacts, including weight gain, increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease. In addition, the committee also found that, while not as prevalent as OSA, narcolepsy can have a debilitating impact on a person's quality of life. The committee heard some heart-wrenching testimony from people with narcolepsy and their parents. There is a need to improve the awareness of this condition, along with other rarer sleep disorders, and for further consideration of how treatment for people with narcolepsy is supported by government and the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report makes a number of recommendations to government, which we hope will be a road map for health agencies, both state and federal. First and foremost, sleep health needs national prioritisation. It is as important as health messages about fitness, nutrition and smoking, and must be treated as one of the pillars of preventive health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee makes other recommendations which are designed to improve support for those with sleep problemsâfrom access to diagnosis to better education for primary health practitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the report to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry into the 2017-18 annual reports of the Department of Health and Australian Hearing focused on hearing services and follows the committee's own 2017 inquiry into the hearing health and wellbeing of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2017 hearing health report was well received by those in the hearing health sectors and has been a catalyst for the Roadmap for Hearing Health, recently released by the federal government and COAG. Given the significant commitment and contributions by hearing health stakeholders that informed that 2017 hearing health inquiry, the committee was keen to examine the government's progress relating to its previous recommendations. The committee also looked at developments in hearing health policy and programs more broadly as contained in the annual reports of the Department of Health and Australian Hearing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's report has highlighted a range of areas where the government has acted, or intends to act, on the hearing health report recommendations, and these are very welcome. These features include additional funding to target the hearing health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities; the funding of Sound Scouts, an online hearing assessments for school-age children, which was recommended by the committee; and the Roadmap for Hearing Health itself, which presents an overarching direction for hearing health services and priorities and represents a new commitment by state and federal governments to addressing many of the issues outlined in our report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While these are all positive steps, a number of hearing health stakeholders expressed their disappointment that some of the hearing health report's recommendations are yet to be actioned. The committee has therefore reiterated many of its hearing health report recommendations that remain relevant today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also put forward six additional recommendations relating to hearing services and the NDIS, mandatory hearing screening for children, a pilot hearing and screening program for adults accessing the aged-care system, and research into balance disorders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Roadmap for Hearing Health should be supported by a clear delineation of jurisdictional responsibilities, time lines for implementation and funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the stakeholders, individuals and government agencies who participated in both inquiries with such keen interest. I also particularly, as we come to the end of the 45th Parliament, thank my committee colleagues for their continued commitment to sleep health, hearing health and health policy more broadly. It has been a committee that's worked exceptionally well, and I pay particular tribute to my deputy chair, the member for Hindmarsh.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, as these are the last reports we will be tabling in this parliament, I want to place on record the committee's thanks for the work of the committee staff, which has been exceptional during the course of this parliament, and we are in their debt. I commend both of these reports to the parliament.</span>

                    </a>  by leaveâFirstly, I would like to thank all the committee members on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, especially those members who sit on the opposite side of the chamber. It is not often that we get to sit and work together and discuss issues in a bipartisan way. I congratulate the members of the opposition on their conduct throughout all committee meetings. I would also like to thank the secretariat for the excellent work that they did throughout the term of this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the export and theft of motor vehicles, it's interesting to note that, last year, there were over 1,000 cars a week stolen across Australia, but that is down 60 per cent from 2001. In fact, in 2001, we had 145,000 motor vehicles stolen in this country. Thankfully, that was reduced to 53,000 last year. But a thousand a week is still far, far too many. And those that have had their motor vehicles stolen know that the cost of the inconvenience, with the things that you have in your car, is often difficult to put an economic value on and often far exceeds the value of the car.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are certainly things that can be done in this space to continue to drive that number down, especially where it involves the federal government and law enforcement agencies. I think one of the most important recommendations that we made was that we amend the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 to make it a specific offence to export stolen goods, including motor vehicles and motor parts. Surprisingly, that is not in there. There is no prohibition under those acts about exporting stolen motor vehicles. I think that would be a very good step that could be done from the recommendation of this report, and I hope that in the next parliament this is taken up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to quickly comment on the committee's work on the illegal tobacco inquiry. This is becoming a more prevalent problem in our society. Although, again, we want to drive down the rate of smoking in this nationâand price is definitely one of the triggers that we have to drive that rate of smoking downâwe must acknowledge that, as we do that, we are increasing the opportunity for smugglers. Cigarettes can be purchased legally overseasâlegally made and manufactured in the country of origin, unlike illegal goodsâand shipped to Australia for less than $2 a packet. Where we are trying to push the retail price up to $40 and $50 a packet, we are creating an enormous opportunity for smugglers and illegal activity. So, if we continue to go down the pricing-prohibitions path, we need to ensure that we give our law enforcement agencies the adequate resources that they need to tackle this growing problem. I thank the House.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of residents of Speewah, Queensland in the federal seat of Leichardt draws to the attention of the House that: The imminent disconnection of television (TV) re-transmission to the Speewah is unacceptable. While TV re-transmission is the responsibility of the Federal government, this was transferred to the Mareeba Shire Council (MSC) by the John Howard government during the Black Spot Program. MSC have now decided that, due to burgeoning costs associated with providing this service, they will cease to maintain it in May 2019. Because Speewah is in the free to air reception zone, most residents are not entitled to utilise Viewer Access Satellite Television (V.A.S.T.). Also, both V.A.S.T. and the Internet are disadvantageous as alternatives as there is no local news or broadcast, an added expense, while the Internet is unreliable with peak time demand. MSC covers a broad geographic range with a low population density, thus presenting fiscal challenges. TV re-transmission is a service provided across Australia by federal government, not local government. The tower from which the five transmitters operate at Speewah is owned by the federally initiated NBN Co.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to- request the Minister for Communications initiate, through his Department, to take responsibility for the maintenance of TV re-transmission at the Speewah area before it is disconnected in May 2019.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of concerned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House to the suffering of the refugees and asylum seekers the Australian government illegally sent to Manus Island, PNG. For over four years these people have been living in appalling conditions but now the situation is progressively getting worse as food, water, electricity and medical aide has been cut to their camp and they are being pressured to relocate to a place where they do not feel safe. This inhumanity needs to end.</span>

Such conduct stands in blatant violation of all international human rights charters that the Chinese government has itself ratified. According to investigative reports published by human rights lawyer David Matas and former Canadian Secretary of State for the Asia Pacific; David Kilgour, tens of thousands of imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to forced organ harvesting for China's transplant market and lost their lives (www.organharvestinvestigation.net). </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">draws to the attention of the House: As at October 2018, there are already at least 277 vacancies for GPs in rural, remote and regional locations across NSW impacting community access to, and viability of general practice services in those locations. Rather than address this shortage of GPS in rural, remote and regional locations, the Commonwealth's Stronger Rural Health Strategy - Improved Access to Australian Trained General Practitioners, which is to take effect on 1 November 2018, will have a detrimental impact on the recruitment and viability of adequate GP workforce to service these locations, as it will be right across Australia. Further, the 20% reduction in Medicare rebates available to new non Vocationally Registered GPs as part of the Strategy (i.e. the introduction of A7 Level Medicare rebates for non VR GPs not on an approved GP training program), will further compromise the viability of general practice in rural locations at a time where drought affected communities can least afford a decrease in access to GP services, or an increase in health care costs.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Firearms Agreement and subsequent laws relating to it have proven ineffective in the prevention of homicides and other violent crime based on data from the Australian Institute of Criminology's 2008 "Trends in Violent Crime" report, among other studies. Australians deserve the right to defend their lives and livelihoods without incriminating themselves, which currently isn't practically possible as even some non-lethal means of self-protection are illegal in most states and territories. Firearms have proven as a life-saving tool in situations where the police cannot respond quick enough across the globe and should be legalised for this very reason, as well as for recreational and occupational use. Firearms are overly regulated and require several hoops to jump through to possess. These laws put honest Australians at a disadvantage, while criminals who intend on harming others will do so regardless of the law or the weapons they use. The reform or repeal of the NFA could cause an increase in firearms-related business, interest in sports such as airsoft and target shooting, and taxes could be imposed on the production and sale of firearms and ammunition.</span>

This excludes certain handguns and automatic firearms, which should require licenses with genuine reasons. We appreciate your reading, thank you.</span>

Rabbits in pairs, Ants going crazy, Frogs talking it up..... Natures rhythm has not been allowed to flow in southern Qld this summer while Nth Qld is out of control. Open the national radar image on the BOM site. A radar 'EMR' pattern emanating over southern Qld that will NOT ALLOW IT TO RAIN within its area. Moisture levels, extreme temperatures, mountain range have been irrelevant, with storms forming up on a line and continuing outside this pattern. Rain moving south from the tropics is 'pushed' around this pattern. A world radar map (Ventusky) showing the ridiculous temperature difference between Australia and other countries on the same latitude. The University of Tasmania has a research degree open at present, stating clearly that Australia and the USA have been taking part in this for the past 60 years. The military could easily continue its path under the guise of trying to curb global warming (clowns in control refuse to address when over unity has been proven) when the motivation is destruction.

              <span class="HPS-Small">As reviews by ASIC, the ABA and the Productivity Commission have found, brokers drive competition by providing a shopfront for smaller lenders, particularly for rural and regional customers. Australia has a population density of 3 people per square kilometre. It is one the least densely populated countries in the world, only Mongolia, the Western Sahara and Suriname have less. We are critical to the health and fairness of Australia's mortgage lending market, ensuring all Australians can benefit from our financial advocacy and mentoring. Our ability to protect an Australian's best interest is our key business driver. We fail to see how decimating the broker channel, leaving Australians with a handful of lenders to choose from, is good for competition, or good for customers. The negative impact of imposing the changes recommended by the Hayne Royal Commission will flow onto to the real estate, construction, the legal and professional services industries. It will create a long-term, sizable economic downturn that will impact the housing affordability nationally and restrict growth enormously. The Australian small business sector as a whole, is heavily reliant on these key industries for ongoing prosperity and longevity. All these claims are easily verifiable and can be confirmed from available financial data. The major banks will always put profit before people and are confident in their protection by the corporate veil.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">A society that invests in science is a society that prospers both economically and socially since at its core lies innovation, creative/critical thinking and ingenuity. Physics is arguably the most fundamental of sciences who's cultivation of the scientific method and problem solving skills are invaluable and offer far reaching benefits to all aspects of society from technology in industry to education. The field should therefore be nurtured and fostered across all Australian Universities. The reality is that in today's age of discovery and with the rapid growth of technology, an undergraduate degree in physics is not enough to ensure employment in the field. Further more, with the demanding study load and complexity of the subject matter, juggling casual or part-time work with full time study is not feasible for any meaningful educational experience. In fact it is highly discouraged by staff and post-graduates alike. Physics is a growing field with an ever increasing amount of young physics students finding themselves in this paradox where full-time postgraduate study is both necessary and impossible.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Pensions</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr Vasta</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 23 November 2016 to the Minister for Human Services, the Hon Alan Tudge MP, regarding Petition PN0024 about changes to the pension assets test that take effect from 1 January 2017. Your letter was referred to me as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Having carefully considered the issues raised in the petition, and acknowledging what a difficult area this is, it appears worthwhile to mention some background information to the issues that the petition raises before discussing specific changes to the Age Pension announced in recent Budgets.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The role of the Age Pension in the retirement income system is to act as a safety net payment that is designed to support a basic, acceptable standard of living, particularly for those with few other resources. The Age Pension is funded by taxpayers, and targeted through the means test to those who need it most. As a non-contributory social security payment, eligibility for the Age Pension is not based on past income or contributions, or taxes paid during a person's working life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the 2015 Intergenerational Report identified, the number of people of traditional working age (being 15 to 64 years old) for every person aged 65 and over has fallen from 7.3 people in 1974-75 to an estimated 4.5 people in 2015. By 2054-55, this is projected to nearly halve again to only 2.7 people. This means that there will be a smaller and smaller proportion of people paying taxes available to pay for a larger proportion of people requiring the</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Age Pension. The idea that taxpayers pay taxes to then enjoy their pension once they reach the age of retirement is not an accurate portrayal of how the mechanics of the tax and transfer system works. What happens in a structural sense in the economy is that this generation of taxpayers is paying taxes to allow this generation of pensions to be paid. If the Australian Government was to make no changes, payments made through the age and service pensions are projected to increase from 2.9 per cent of Gross Domestic Product today, to 3.6 per cent by 2054-55.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Failure to deal with this growing spending problem will mean that future governments will be forced to reduce spending on other social programs in health or disability, or invest less in programs in education and infrastructure that ultimately assist in growing the economy and help to pay for the Age Pension. Alternatively, government deficits and debt will increase, and this is just something that the Government does not consider to be a viable long-term option. Without any changes, the expenditure on the Age Pension was projected to rise from $39.5 billion in 2013-14 to $72.3 billion in 2023-24. This left the Government with the difficult task of identifying where restraint could and should be exercised.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the 2014-15 Budget, the Government put forward a number of proposals to improve the sustainability of the Age Pension. This included increasing the Age Pension qualifying age from 67 to 70 from 1 July 2025 to 1 July 2035, and indexing pension payments by the Consumer Price Index from 1 September 2017. These changes would have ensured that spending on the age and service pensions would be projected to account for 2.7 per cent of Gross Domestic Product by 2054-55, which is similar to today's level. As you would be aware, the Government was unsuccessful in having these measures pass the Senate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, any rational government cannot walk away from the necessary goal of having a pension system which is sustainable for future generations. The Government maintains its policy to increase the Age Pension qualifying age to 70, however has decided not to proceed with plans to index the pension to Consumer Price Index only. With this in mind, the Government implemented an alternative approach in the 2015-16 Budget.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the reform of Australia's pension system, the assets test has been changed to ensure that resources are focused on those with lower or moderate private wealth outside of the family home. The family home will continue to be excluded from the assets test and as at 1 January 2017, the asset free area for pensioners has increased. For couples with a family home, this increased from $296,500 to $375,000. This has resulted in around 165,000 pensioners with moderate assets receiving an increased pension by an average of about $25 a fortnight, including around 47,600 pensioners qualifying for a full pension. Assets tested couples who own their own home with additional assets of less than $453,500 have received a higher pension.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The effect of this is that around 90 per cent of pensioners and other Australians who receive pension-linked payments are either better off, or have had no change to their arrangements under these new rules.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In terms of the changes to taper rates and the assets test cut off, it is fair to point out that the changes the Government has introduced only reverse the changes made by the Howard Government in 2007. Pension payments are reduced by $3 a fortnight for every additional $1,000 in assets above the minimum threshold for a full pension, rather than $1.50. This results in the assets test cut off, excluding the family home, being set at $550,000 for single home owners and $827,000, for couple home owners.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The lower taper rate introduced by the Howard Government had put an extra 110,000 people on the part-pension, which in the context of the time, while generous, was at least for a short time affordable. This change was introduced at a time when the budget was in surplus, and there was $40 billion in the bank. Due to the state of fiscal disrepair left by the former Labor Government, this measure is no longer affordable. The sad reality of the present situation is that any expenditure in pension payment growth that cannot be restrained by this Government will be expenditure on pensions funded by debt and required to be repaid by future generations of taxpayers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is also important to note that during the 2016 election, Labor ultimately acknowledged the importance of budget repair and confirmed they would not be reversing the Government's changes to the assets test were they to win government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government appreciates that these changes affect a number of pensioners. In the worst case scenario of the recent budget changes, anyone negatively impacted will require a drawdown of less than 1.9 per cent on their additional assets to maintain their current level of income. From commencement of the changes all people who had their pension and associated Pensioner Concession Card cancelled because of these changes were guaranteed eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card and/or Health Care Card, which provides the same concessional access to pharmaceuticals as is given to those on the pension.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, as announced in the 2017-18 Budget, the Pensioner Concession Card will be reinstated to former pension recipients who lost entitlement to the Pensioner Concession Card on 1 January 2017 because of the changes to the assets test. This change will be implemented from 9 October 2017, and will facilitate these people accessing hearing services through the Department of Health, as well as discounts and concessions offered by the states and territories and private providers. These recipients will also continue to benefit from access to Commonwealth concessions for pharmaceuticals and Medicare services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with the Health Care Card and Commonwealth Seniors Health Card they currently have, the Pensioner Concession Card will be automatically reissued with an ongoing income and assets test exemption. Other eligibility requirements, such as portability conditions, will still need to be met. These people will also retain the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card to ensure they continue to receive the Energy Supplement. The Health Care Card will become redundant and will be deactivated and not be reissued.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These changes to the assets test should not act as a disincentive for people to save for their retirement. Analysis based purely on income loss as a result of a reduced part-pension, does not recognise the capacity of people to draw down on their assets to support themselves in retirement. It suggests that people should be able to earn income from their superannuation and other retirement savings while retaining their capital base intact, with the Age Pension operating as an income top-up. This would mean that the Age Pension system would support wealth maintenance, rather than savings, including from superannuation, being used for self-support in retirement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For those most affected by the changes announced in the 2015-16 Budget (partnered home owner couples who have $827,000 in assessable assets and single home owners with $550,000 in assessable assets from 1 July 2017), their level of assets held, not including their home, equates to almost 24 years of the full rate of partnered or single pension. Rather than being disadvantaged by having substantial savings, retirees affected by the assets test changes could still support a significantly higher standard of living in retirement than the maximum rate of pension through a combination of investment earnings, capital drawdowns and eventual pension entitlements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For example - assuming the drawdown of investment returns and capital over a 35 year period, and long-term investment returns averaging five per cent, the partnered couple could generate a total income (including investment returns, capital drawdowns and eventual pension entitlements) of over $59,000 a year in real terms, which is approximately $24,000 a year higher than the partnered full pension, and the single person could generate a total income of around $40,000 a year in real terms, which is approximately $17,000 a year higher than the single full pension.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Allowing the Age Pension to support wealth maintenance, by acting as an income top-up on superannuation earnings, while allowing retirees to keep their capital base intact, would go against the original intent and design of the superannuation system, that original intent being to reduce demand on the Age Pension system by building up savings for individuals' use to support themselves in retirement. The Age Pension is a safety net designed to provide assistance to those who do not have the means to provide for their retirement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While more people, including those on average incomes, will be affected by the changes to the Age Pension over time, this is not surprising. The key driver of the projected lower future Age Pension coverage is higher superannuation balances. This will occur as the superannuation guarantee further matures and retirees, including those on average incomes, have had a lifetime of superannuation contributions. This is the superannuation system doing its job. More people will retire on higher super balances reducing their call on the Age Pension.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for putting this petition to the Government. I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

We regularly raise human rights issues, including regarding freedoms of religion or belief, with China. On 6 November 2018, Australia raised concerns during China's Universal Periodic Review at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. I have attached a copy of this statement for your convenience. I reiterated these concerns to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during my visit to Beijing on 8 November 2018. We will continue to seek opportunities, both publically and privately, to raise our concerns with China about restrictions on freedoms of religion or belief</span>

Australia opposes this practice, and we noted the announcement in 2015 by the head of China's organ donation committee that only voluntarily donated organs from civilians could be used in transplants. We will continue.to urge China to ensure regulations on organ transplants are fully implemented at all levels.</span>

              </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government of Australia welcomes China's engagement in the UPR process. We recognise China's extraordinary economic and social development, an achievement which has significantly reduced overall poverty. Australia welcomes China's 2016-2020 Third National Human Rights Action Plan, and our bilateral cooperation including in our Human Rights Technical Cooperation Program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While welcoming these achievements and cooperation, we note significant regression in some areas of civil and political rights since China's last Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in 2013 and have a range of concerns including the following.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia notes that in its 2013 UPR, China accepted Australia's recommendation that it 'strengthen protection of ethnic minorities' religious, socio-economic and political rights, ensuring reports of violations are promptly and transparently investigated; and 'permanently lift restrictions on access to minority areas'. Australia shares the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination's (UN CERD) concern at reports that Uighurs, Tibetans and other ethnic groups and human rights defenders have been tortured or otherwise ill-treated. Australia shares the UN CERD's alarm at numerous reports of detention of large numbers of ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim groups held incommunicado and often for long periods without being charged or tried, which exacerbates rather than prevents religious extremism; and reports of mass surveillance disproportionately targeting ethnic Uighurs and Tibetans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia recommends that China cease the practice of arbitrarily detaining Uighurs</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">and other Muslim groups in Xinjiang, which is more likely to exacerbate than prevent religious extremism; and as recommended by UN CERD, immediately release individuals currently detained. Australia recommends China cease restrictions, including military and police measures, on Uighurs' and Tibetans' freedom of movement. Australia recommends that China allow access to Tibet and Xinjiang by the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights and Special Procedures mandate-holders. Australia recommends that China strengthen measures to prevent torture and ill-treatment committed against religious and ethnic groups as recommended by UN CERD.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia welcomes China's improvements in evidentiary and judicial processes in capital punishment cases, including the increased scrutiny and review of death penalty cases. However, Australia remains concerned at China's retention of the death penalty and its refusal to publish execution data in <span style="font-style:italic;">an </span>open and transparent manner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia recommends China work towards the abolition of the death penalty, and publish execution data as a priority, to promote transparency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is concerned at increasing restrictions on the freedom of religion or belief, including amongst China's Christian believers. Australia's concern was heightened following China's April 2018 White Paper on Religious Belief, which located the right to religious freedom in China's Criminal Law, National Security Law and Counter-terrorism Law, rather than laws on religion or human rights.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia recommends that China fully protect freedom of religion or belief, by ensuring that Chinese law supports the rights of individuals to freely practise their religion without impermissible government influence or intervention,</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is concerned by the conditions for China's human rights defenders, some of whom remain in detention without trial, and others who are increasingly subject to administrative punishments including the revocation of licenses to practise law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia recommends China release all human rights lawyers and defenders</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">currently detained under charges relating to national security, incurred in the course of pursuing their work, or exercising rights protected under the Chinese Constitution.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is concerned at increasing restrictions on freedom of expression in China, particularly online.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia recommends that China expedite legal and institutional reforms necessary to ensure that freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly are fully protected in law and practice, consistent with its preparation for ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia strongly supports the continuation of the 'one country, two systems' framework, with Hong Kong enjoying a high degree of autonomy. It is important to maintain the freedoms enshrined in the Basic Law under this framework, including freedom of speech, the press and assembly. These freedoms are fundamental to confidence in the vitality and success of 'one country, two systems', which delivers significant benefits to Hong Kong, China and the international community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Region Government continue to uphold the rights, freedoms and rule of law embodied in the 'one country, two systems' framework. Similarly, Australia recommends that the 'one country, two systems' framework which allows the Macau Special Administrative Region to exercise a high degree of autonomy over its affairs continues to be maintained.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Paragraph 4 of China's 2018 National Report states that "there is no universal road for the development of human rights in the world", with the relevant section headed "human rights with Chinese characteristics"; in contrast China's 2013 report stated "China respects the principle of universality of human rights".</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Does China still accept the principle of universal human rights, and if not, can China explain how its conception of human rights fits into the international human rights regime built on the concept of universality? Can China explain how "human rights with Chinese characteristics" differs from universal human rights, and if it does not, why it wishes to introduce this distinction?</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Paragraph 14 of China's 2018 National Report states that "China has signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the relevant departments of the Government are steadily continuing to advance administrative and judicial reforms in preparation for its ratification".</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Given that China's 2013 National Report paragraph 7 was in similar terms, can China provide more information on the progress it has made since 2013 to ratify the ICCPR?

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Paragraph 14 of China's 2018 National Report states that "China is also in the process of studying...the issue of establishing a national human rights institution in accordance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles)".</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 3 December 2018 about Petition PN0384 concerning the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) board appointment process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 </span>(ABC Act), a merit-based selection process must be followed before the Governor-General may appoint a non-executive director to the ABC Board. The ABC Act requires this process to be conducted by an independent Nomination Panel (the Panel), which is appointed by the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The selection process is undertaken by the Panel at arms-length of Government, and all applicants are assessed against statutory selection criteria and on the basis of merit.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under this process, the Panel provides the Government with a written report that nominates candidates. The Government then considers the Panel's nominations and subsequently makes recommendations to the Governor-General for an appointment to this position. The ABC Act allows for the Government to recommend people to be appointed to the ABC Board that were not nominated by the Panel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If a person not nominated by the Nomination Panel is appointed by the Governor-General as the Chairperson of the ABC Board, the Prime Minister must table the reasons for that appointment in each House of Parliament no later than 15 sittings days after the appointment was made. The reasons must include an assessment of the person against the selection criteria.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The selection process to till the ABC Chairperson vacancy is nearing completion. The Prime Minister has recently announced his intention to recommend to the Governor-General that Ms Ita Buttrose be appointed as the next Chair of the ABC.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ms Buttrose is an exceptionally qualified candidate with a comprehensive background in the media industry. As well as being 2013 Australian of the Year, Ms Buttrose is a member of the Australian Media Hall of Fame, founded Cleo Magazine, was Editor of The Australian Women's Weekly, Editor in-Chief of the Daily Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph and The Sun-Herald and has worked for all the commercial television broadcasters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ms Buttrose has also served on the board of News Ltd, on the Advisory Board of the Australian Women Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry and as Director and board members for a range of charities including the National Breast Cancer Centre Advisory Network, The Smith Family and Alzheimer's Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has followed the legislated process for making this appointment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to ABC funding, under the Coalition Government the ABC has continued to receive over $1 billion in funding each year. The level of funding being provided is increasing year on year which means that in a rapidly changing media environment, the ABC has greater funding certainty than any other media organisation in the nation.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your letter of 18 February 2019 concerning Petition number PN0388, an Australian Government agency for natural therapies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the Minister for Health, I am aware that many Australians choose natural therapies and medicines over conventional approaches to healthcare; and that many seek improved funding of research into their effectiveness, safety and cost benefits. The Liberal National Government recognises that all medicines and therapies should be tested in well-designed clinical trials and the results should be analysed objectively. Claims of effectiveness should be based on supporting evidence, whether treatments are traditional, alternative or used in conventional medicine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition asks for the creation of a new Australian Government agency, independent of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), to distribute research funding for natural therapies, conduct reviews of natural therapies, and determine potential health and budgetary benefits of encouraging private health fund access to natural therapies and qualified practitioners.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises NHMRC as Australia's leading expert body responsible for supporting health and medical research. NHMRC manages a grant program that funds research across the spectrum of health and medical issues. All schemes are competitive, and applications for any funding scheme are assessed through NHMRC's internationally recognised and rigorous peer review processes. This competition is key to ensuring only the most meritorious and highest quality applications receive taxpayer funding. NHMRC has provided over $66 million towards complementary medicine research since 2009.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Researchers may also wish to monitor opportunities announced under the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) established by the Government, which is additional and complementary to NHMRC. Individuals and community research organisations are encouraged to register with the GrantConnect website to ensure they receive up-to-date information on new grant opportunities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">NHMRC also plays a key role in providing trustworthy advice on health practices and therapies. NHMRC uses standardised, internationally accepted methods and quality assurance processes to search for and identify evidence, and assess its quality and reliability. Importantly, the <span style="font-style:italic;">NHMRC Act 1992 </span>requires public consultation for guidelines, giving the opportunity for the community, clinicians and policy makers to submit their views and ensure that all high quality, reliable evidence has been taken into account. NHMRC also routinely seeks expert review of its guidelines and evidence products as another type of quality assurance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am aware of the Ombudsman investigation into a complaint made about how the NHMRC conducted its review of Homeopathy, completed in 2015. It is my understanding, however, that this is not an investigation into any scientific research bias or misconduct. Thus I believe that the current arrangements are appropriate for the research needs of the sector, particularly given the costs and administrative burden of establishing and maintaining a new Government agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition also seeks a role for the proposed new agency in relation to private health insurance. The Department of Health previously commissioned NHMRC to review the scientific literature examining the effectiveness and, where available, the safety and cost effectiveness of a number of natural therapies. The outcomes of these reviews were provided to the Department in 2014 to inform its Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Private Health Insurance for Natural Therapies (the Review), which was overseen by its Natural Therapies Review Advisory Committee. The decision to remove some natural therapies from private health insurance cover was made following this Review.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At this point in time, I don't believe there is a need to conduct another review, but I encourage natural therapies researchers to build their body of research on the effectiveness and safety of their chosen field using the funding opportunities provided by NHMRC and MRFF.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 April 2019 insurers will not be able to offer benefits for certain natural therapies as part of a complying health insurance policy. These therapies include Alexander technique, aromatherapy, Bowen therapy, Buteyko, Feldenkrais, Western herbalism, homeopathy, iridology, kinesiology, naturopathy, Pilates, reflexology, Rolfing, shiatsu, tai chi and yoga.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The natural therapies were examined in the context of their funding by private health insurance, supported by the taxpayer funded private health insurance rebate. The Review found that in most cases there was insufficient evidence to draw definite conclusions regarding the clinical effectiveness of these therapies. Following the outcome of the Review, the Government decided to no longer use taxpayers' funds to subsidise private health insurance cover for therapies that lack evidence of clinical efficacy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These changes do not restrict providers of natural therapies from trading or stop Australian consumers from choosing to purchase natural therapies themselves.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;" />Dear Mr Vasta</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 20 March 2017 to the Minister for Human Services, the Hon Alan Tudge MP, regarding Petition EN0109 Schoolkids bonus. Your letter has been referred to me as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities. 1 regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the challenges all Australian parents experience in the care of their children and so maintains a range of programs and payments to support them. Currently, the Government spends a substantial amount of taxpayer money in three main areas of family support each year: around $19 billion in Family Tax Benefit; around $8 billion in Child Care payments; and around $2 billion in Paid Parental Leave.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government remains committed to helping parents balance their work and family responsibilities through a range of programs and payments but this must necessarily be balanced with the responsibility to ensure family assistance and social security payments are well targeted and sustainable into the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware as part of the 2013 Federal Election, the Government pledged to end the Schoolkids Bonus as a way of ensuring the sustainability in the family payment system. The Schoolkids Bonus was originally established using anticipated revenue from the Minerals Resource Rent Tax, which was repealed in 2014. This tax, proposed by the former Government, didn't raise as much revenue as expected and as such the Schoolkids Bonus was never properly funded.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In September 2014, parliament passed legislation to abolish the Schoolkids Bonus with the last payments made in July 2016. It is also important to note that during the 2016 election, Labor ultimately acknowledged the importance of budget repair and confirmed they would not reinstate the Schoolkids Bonus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is offering a more targeted and efficient approach to improve educational outcomes for students through effective education policies, rather than bonus payments to individuals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to ensuring families and children have the opportunities they need to succeed, and that is why the Government is boosting support for school students by an average of $2,300 per student. In addition, the Government's reforms to the child care and early learning system are set to make the system affordable and accessible with an additional investment of $2.5 billion. For more information on the early learning and child care reforms go to, www.education.gov.au/early-childhood-and-child-care, or for more information on the Government's needs-based funding changes for schools go to, www.education.cov.au/quality-schools.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If individuals are experiencing financial difficulties. I would encourage them to access an accredited community-based financial counselling service. Financial counsellors are funded by the Government and provide free and independent advice and assistance. They are available in every state and territory. Individuals can phone the National Financial Counselling Helpline on freecall 1800 007 007 which is open from 9.30am to 4.30pm, Monday to Friday, to locate their nearest free financial counselling service and to make an appointment. When they call this number they will be automatically transferred to the phone service in their state or territory.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is also possible for individuals who are having difficulties to contact a Centrelink social worker. Centrelink social workers are a free service and available to provide counselling, support and referral services as needed. Centrelink social workers in their area would also be familiar with other services available locally which may be able to assist them. Centrelink social workers can be contacted by phone on 13 2850 for the cost of a local call.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It should be noted that families facing unexpected costs who are receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A by fortnightly payments can ask for an advance payment which is part of their future entitlements for a period of up to six months. Their ongoing Family Tax Benefit Part A payments will be reduced as repayment for the advanced payment. If an individual wishes to test their eligibility for an advance payment, they can phone Centrelink on 13 6150 for the cost of a local call. Please note that calls made from a mobile to the numbers listed above may incur additional costs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Individuals may also wish to call Centrelink to discuss their situation. They can also visit www.humanservices.gov.au for more information on a range of payments available to families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Individuals could also consider approaching their child's school about alternative payment arrangements for school related expenses such as excursions_ Some schools allow for fortnightly payments through Centrepay. Centrepay is a free voluntary bill paying service. Deductions come from your Centrelink payments and can be used to pay many types of bills, such as child care, electricity bills or rent. More information is available at: www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/centrelink/centrepay. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Despite $6.2 billion of Commonwealth funding in housing assistance and homelessness services, including $1.3 billion through the National Affordable Housing Agreement (NAHA) and $115 million through the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness (NPAH), housing and homelessness outcomes continue to decline.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In large part this is due to the poor design and lack of transparency and accountability for performance within the current NAHA. The Government is serious about reforming the NAHA and the NPAH to ensure the funding provided to the states and territories is used efficiently and effectively to maximise housing and homelessness outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 July 2018, a new National Housing and Homelessness Agreement (NHHA) will replace the existing National Affordable Housing Specific Purpose Payment (NAHSPP) and the NPAH to increase the supply of new homes and improve outcomes for all Australians across the housing spectrum, particularly those most in need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The new NHHA will be developed in close negotiation with states and territories with funding tied to the delivery of mutually agreed, measureable actions targeting priority areas, which will include homelessness.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under these new arrangements, the Government is removing the uncertainty of short-term extensions of homelessness funding by rolling the NPAH funding into the new agreement on an ongoing basis. The funding will be indexed and will be matched by states and territories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure that funding for frontline homelessness services is preserved, the new NHHA will separately identify the rolled in NPAII funding. Over the forward estimates to 2021 this amounts to $375 million. This funding will continue to be dedicated solely to funding homelessness services across Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With homelessness funding now settled, the new agreement will support all governments to develop a national approach to reducing homelessness that will link with other national priorities, including domestic violence and child protection, in order to leverage better outcomes for a common group of vulnerable individuals.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr Vasta</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 22 May 2017 regarding petition number EN0160, in relation to the provision of income support payments, job seeker mutual obligation requirements, work programs and the provision of public housing. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The provision of an income support safety net for working-age Australians is a longstanding policy that has been supported by successive governments and meets community expectations. Without this safety net many Australians and their families would experience serious hardship when they become unemployed or experience other changes in circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Social security payments operate in conjunction with taxation concessions, productivity initiatives, employment services and labour market strategies, as part of an integrated package to support workforce participation objectives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Newstart Allowance is the primary income support payment for unemployed people of workforce age while they look for work. Recipients are required to demonstrate that they are actively looking for work, or undertaking activities to improve their work prospects. These long standing arrangements are called mutual obligation requirements and generally meet community expectations for receipt of taxpayer funded income support. Job seekers must meet their mutual obligation requirements to continue to receive payment, unless they have been granted an exemption by the Department of Human Services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Newstart Allowance is not time-limited. This is because many recipients require additional assistance to increase their employability and may take longer to become 'job ready' because of barriers they face, such as low levels of education, no significant employment experience, or a lower capacity to participate due to an illness or disability, or significant caring responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Newstart Allowance recipients are expected to do all they can to become job ready, find work and reduce their reliance on income support. For this reason mutual obligation requirements may include activities such as job search, part-time work, training, Work for the Dole or other approved activities that improves their job readiness and employability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Mutual obligation requirements are agreed between the job seeker and their employment services provider, and are included in a Job Plan which outlines the expectations and obligations of the recipient in return for income support payments. This includes the type of activities to be undertaken by the job seeker and may include advice or training, such as appropriate behaviour and presentation when undertaking job search activities. Job seekers who fail to meet their mutual obligation requirements or comply with their Job Plan may be subject to compliance action.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2017-18 Budget, the Government announced a new targeted compliance framework that strengthens penalties for people who persistently and deliberately do not comply with their requirements while receiving unemployment payments. While the majority of job seekers genuinely try to meet their requirements while on payment, a small but persistent minority consistently do not meet their requirements despite being able.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 July 2018, subject to the passage of legislation, the new targeted compliance framework will strengthen penalties for those job seekers while reducing penalties for job seekers who are generally compliant but occasionally miss a requirement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All job seekers will commence in the Personal Responsibility Phase (demerits phase), where failures will result in a payment suspension and demerit, but no actual penalty. If a job seeker accrues four demerits in six months they will enter the Intensive Compliance Phase (three strikes phase), in which they will face stronger penalties. They will:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">lose 50 per cent of their fortnightly payment for their first strike;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">lose 100 per cent of their fortnightly payment for their second strike; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">have their payment cancelled for four weeks for their third strike.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Job seekers who remain fully compliant for three months in the three strikes phase will return to the demerits phase, with their demerits reset to zero. In either phase, any jobseeker who refuses work without a valid reason will have their payment cancelled for four weeks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, some jobseekers may be unable to meet their requirements due to personal circumstances that have not been fully taken into account or may have a greater than expected impact. To protect these job seekers from inappropriate penalties, providers will interview them about their non-compliance when three demerits have been accrued. The Department of Human Services will follow-up with an assessment of the job seekers' capability when four demerits have been accrued. In both instances, requirements will be adjusted to match capabilities where necessary, and demerits may be reset to zero.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the suggestion for a new work program, there is a range of existing work programs and employment incentives, including Work for the Dole, which is designed to help job seekers build their skills, demonstrate work behaviours and get involved in their local community. Other programs include the National Work Experience Program and the Youth Jobs PaTH initiative, which is designed to give young job seekers the skills and work experience they need to get and keep a job.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In regard to the provision of public housing, while the Commonwealth Government provides the states and territories with about $1.3 billion each year under the National Affordable Housing Agreement for housing assistance, the day-to-day management of public housing rests with individual state and territory governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If the petitioner would like further information about housing in their state, I would encourage them to contact their local state or territory government housing authority.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 16 August 2017 to the Minister of Social Services, the Hon Christian Porter MP. regarding petition EN0240 - Cashless Debit Card trial. Your letter has been referred to me as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petition calling for the Cashless Debit Card (CDC) not to be introduced in the Hinkler electorate was presented to the House of Representatives on 14 August 2017 and acknowledge the concerns of the 330 signatories.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 21 September 2017, the Commonwealth Government announced the federal electorate of Hinkler as a new CDC site, with rollout to commence early next year. In selecting the region as a site for the CDC, the Government considered two key factors. Firstly the need for strong community leadership support, and second, a demonstrable social need.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In May and June 2017, I visited Bundaberg and Hervey Bay with the Member for Hinkler, the Hon Keith Pitt MP. I met with state government services, business groups, welfare organisations and church leaders, and heard first-hand about the issues facing the region. During these consultations, broad support for the introduction of the card was evident.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">From July to September 2017, the Department of Social Services (the Department) conducted extensive consultations regarding the CDC program in Bundaberg, Hervey Bay and Childers.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Bundaberg/Hervey Bay region was chosen based on consultations with community leaders , which identified three pressing social challenges which may be helped by the card: high youth unemployment and entrenched welfare dependence, young families requiring support and higher than average drug and alcohol use.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The region has the second highest youth unemployment rate in Queensland at 23.6 per cent, with many now experiencing intergenerational welfare dependence. Of those who are under 30 years of age on unemployment benefits today, 90 per cent had a parent who was also on welfare during the past 15 years. Without any intervention, it is projected that approximately 57 per cent of Newstart and Youth Allowance (job seeker) participants aged 30 and under in Bundaberg and the Fraser Coast will still be receiving income support in 10 years' time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department also received feedback that the needs of young children were not being met. Community organisations providing emergency relief and housing advised that their services were increasingly being utilised by young families. A number of these organisations reported that some parents were spending most of their time and money drinking alcohol, which is having a detrimental impact on their ability to provide food, schooling and other activities for their children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The introduction of the CDC in Hinkler aims to provide an opportunity for parents to ensure that their children are well cared for and to improve employment prospects for young people. As evidenced further below, the independent evaluation of the CDC found the program had achieved "considerable positive impacts" in the first two trial sites, specifically in relation to drug and alcohol use, participants being better able to care for their children and by increasing motivation to find employment.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government is committed to building collaborative working relationships with local and state governments to assist in the implementation and ongoing monitoring of the program. The Commonwealth Government will continually monitor and review the impact of the program.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government has also established a Community Reference Group comprised of local experts from different sectors across the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area. This Group will meet regularly to provide advice to the Commonwealth Government and feedback on the views of the community.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The final independent evaluation of the current CDC trial sites in the East Kimberley, Western Australia. and Ceduna, South Australia, found that the CDC has had a "considerable positive impact" in the communities where it has operated. It also showed that people had become more accepting of the card over time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The complete final evaluation report is available at www.dss.gov.au/families-and-children/progams-services/welfare-quarantining/cashless-debit-card-trial-evaluation-reports.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The evaluation concluded that the Cashless Debit Card, "has been effective in reducing alcohol consumption and gambling in both trial sites and [is] also suggestive of a reduction in the use of illegal drugs."</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In particular, the evaluation found that:</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">of those who drank alcohol before the trial started, 41 per cent said they are drinking alcohol less often;</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">of those surveyed who said they had drunk six or more drinks at once before the trial started, 37 per cent reported they did this less often;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">of those surveyed who said they were using illegal drugs before the trial started, 48 per cent reported using these less since the CDC's introduction;</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">of those surveyed who said they gambled before the trial started, 48 per cent reported gambling less;</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">of participants with caring responsibilities, 40 per cent reported being able to better care for their children since being on the card. and 39 per cent reported being more involved in their children's homework and school.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The evaluation also found widespread positive spill over benefits from the CDC, including:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Forty-five per cent of participants reported being able to save more money than before the trial; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Stakeholders reporting a decrease in requests for emergency food relief and financial assistance, and increased purchases of baby items, food, clothing, shoes, toys and other goods for children.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The evaluation showed no increase in crime rates attributable to the introduction of the card. In fact, both qualitative and quantitative research found that crime and violence had reduced over the duration of the CDC trial, specifically, there was "considerable observable evidence being cited by many community leaders and stakeholders of a reduction in crime, violence and harmful behaviours". For example, local merchants and police reported that they had observed fewer incidents of theft involving food-related items and clothing. Most stakeholders and community leaders reported that violent and aggressive behaviours had also reduced, including public acts of aggression.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no evidence of the CDC stifling economic growth. The card works like any other Visa debit card and can be used at any business with EFTPOS facilities that does not primarily sell alcohol or gambling products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am committed to ongoing communication with the community to ensure that all stakeholders have access to accurate information about the program and how the card works.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Standing Committee on Petitions - EN0674 - ban for single use straws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Coalition Government is providing national leadership through the Meeting of Environment Ministers. We have developed a new National Waste Policy and are now working on an action plan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A key role of the Australian Government (the Government) in waste management is to coordinate national policy initiatives in partnership with state and territory governments and industry. As state, territory, and local governments are primarily responsible for litter management, the Government strongly supports and encourages jurisdictions to reduce litter and other wastes, including straws and other products made of plastics, to minimise their impact on the environment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Actions to prevent and minimise common marine debris items such as straws are being undertaken by local governments across Australia. For example, Brisbane City Council has committed to banning plastic straws and Adelaide City Council will ban straws from events in Adelaide's central business district from 2019. The ACT Government has also implemented the Straws Suck campaign to help rid Canberra cafes and bars of single use plastic straws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Industry is also taking action to ban straws. For example, McDonald's is phasing out plastic straws across Australia by 2020, Woolworths is committing to stop selling plastic straws by the end of 2018, Starbucks is eliminating plastic straws from its stores worldwide by 2020 and Coca Cola Australia have committed to replace plastic straws with paper.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for writing to me on this matter. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 15 October 2018 regarding a petition (EN0712) requesting all ex-members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) who have served in a war zone, have served 20 years plus, or have been medically discharged, be issued with a Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) Health Card â All Conditions (Gold Card) on discharge.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to supporting veterans and their families and invests more than $11 Billion each year to ensure they receive the critical services and support they deserve.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">By way of background, the Gold Card provides health services for any medical condition, regardless of the whether that condition is related to service. At present, there are a number of ways in which an ex-member can be eligible for the Gold Card, such as:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">being in receipt of 100 per cent or more of the general rate of disability pension;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">being a former prisoner of war;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">having rendered qualifying service and reaching the age of 70; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">being a British Nuclear Test participant.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Otherwise, where a medical condition has been accepted as being related to a person's service, treatment for that condition is available through the provision of a DVA Health Card â For Specific Conditions (White Card). Compensation for the accepted condition may also be available, depending on the circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">White there are no plans to further expand eligibility for the Gold Card at this time, the Government has made many important changes to support better access to treatment and streamline administrative processes associated with claiming service related health conditions. In particular, the Government has made several important investments in recent years to ensure better access to mental health care and support for veterans and their families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For example, Non-Liability Health Care (NLHC) provides free treatment for any mental health condition for anyone with a single day of full-time service in the ADF. Reservists who have rendered disaster relief service, border protection service or were involved in a serious service-related training accident may also be eligible. Those discharging from the ADF are now automatically issued with a White Card for mental health treatment upon their discharge and can access a range of supporting, including services from general practitioners, psychologists, psychiatrists and counselling through Open Arms â Veterans and Families Counselling Service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also introduced the Veteran Payment in May 2018. This payment provides interim financial support for veterans who lodge a claim for any mental health condition under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA) </span>or <span style="font-style:italic;">Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988 (DRCA) </span>while their claim for compensation is being processed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also trailing Provisional Access to Medical Treatment. This provides eligible veterans with access to medical treatment while their claim for liability for one of 20 specified service injuries or diseases is being processed under the MRCA or DRCA. Provisional access to medical treatment is intended to contribute to improved physical and mental health of eligible veterans, as well as reduce deterioration of medical conditions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">OVA is also undertaking work to improve and streamline the claims process for clients as part of the significant program of transformation currently underway. Where certain eligibility criteria are met, decision makers can simplify the investigation and decision making process for claims lodged under the MRCA and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Entitlements Act 1986 </span>(VEA). There are approximately 40 'decision-ready' conditions under the MRCA, and 11 under the VEA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Once again, please be assured that the Government is absolutely committed to supporting the health and wellbeing needs of Australia's veteran community and ensuring they can access the services and support they need quickly and easily.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 October 2018 concerning the petition to consider allowing first home buyers to withdraw the entirety of their superannuation savings in order to purchase a house. I sincerely apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Allowing people to purchase a first home with all of the savings in their superannuation account would be counter to the key objective of the superannuation system, which is to provide income in retirement to substitute or supplement the Age Pension.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The most important issue for first home buyer affordability is the size of the deposit required to enter the housing market. The Government's First Home Superannuation Saver Scheme (the Scheme) is aimed at helping first home buyers save for a deposit within their superannuation by making additional voluntary contributions. While the exact outcome will depend on an individual's income and how long their savings are in the Scheme, most first home savers using the Scheme will be able to boost their savings by at least 30 per cent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, first home buyers also tend to have low superannuation balances, limiting the usefulness of the suggestion to enable the withdrawal of all superannuation savings for first home buyers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With regards to the request to reduce stamp duty and other associated taxes for first home buyers, most if not all of the taxes referenced are levied by State Governments. As stamp duty and other associated taxes are State government based charges, the Commonwealth Government is unable to interfere in their application and provide an exemption for first home owners, or increase their application for investors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I would encourage you and the signatories to the petition to raise your concerns on the levying of stamp duties and related taxes with the relevant State and Territory Treasurers.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence, originally directed to the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, Minister for Families and Social Services, concerning petition number EN0738, requesting the introduction of aged parental leave in federal legislation. Your correspondence has been referred to me as I have responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to helping Australians to balance their work and caring responsibilities. Under the National Employment Standards in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009, </span>eligible employees with at least 12 months' continuous service with their employer may request flexible working arrangements. Eligible employees include carers (as defined under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Carer Recognition Act 2010) </span>and employees aged 55 or older. Employers who receive a request must provide a written response within 21 days and may refuse a request only on reasonable business grounds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">An employer who receives a request for flexible working arrangements from an employee whose employment conditions are set by a Modern Award is also required to genuinely try to reach agreement with the employee by discussing their request with them. If the employer cannot agree to the employee's request, the employer must consider alternative arrangements that the employer can offer the employee so as to better accommodate the employee's circumstances. Further information is available on the Fair Work Ombudsman's website at www.fairwork.gov.au/employee-entitlements/flexibility-in-the-workplace/flexible-working-arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Personal/carer's leave is also available under the National Employment Standards to employees who need time off work to provide care or support for a member of their immediate family or household who requires support because of a personal illness, or personal injury affecting the member or an unexpected emergency affecting the member. Permanent full-time employees are entitled to 10 days' paid personal/carer's leave each year (pro-rated for part-time employees) which accumulates from year to year. All employees, including casuals, are entitled to unpaid carer's leave of two days per occasion. The National Employment Standards are a minimum entitlement and employers and employees may agree on additional carer's leave entitlements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also providing more choices for older Australians to live healthier, more independent and safer lives, so they can take advantage of the opportunities that a longer life brings. In the 2018-19 Budget, the Government announced the <span style="font-style:italic;">More Choices for a Longer Life </span>package. This package provides a range of measures including increased funding for home care to support older people who want to stay at home. More information on these measures is available at www.budget.gov.au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 26 November 2018 about a petition (EN0754) concerning the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Australian Government provides an overall level of funding to the ABC, the ABC has legislated independence in relation to operational matters. Parliament has guaranteed this independence and as a consequence, internal ABC operational decisions are the responsibility of the ABC Board and Executive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2018-19 the Government will provide the ABC over $1 billion in annual funding. This represents a substantial investment of public funds and will ensure that the ABC is able to continue to provide television, radio and digital media services in line with its Charter. The ABC has greater funding certainty than any other media organisation in the nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ABC advises that it continually assesses the technologies that deliver iview and the cost to support devices, with the aim of providing iview to as many people as possible. This means, from time to time, decisions will be made to retire support for devices. These decisions consider the resources and cost to maintain support, the technologies and security features of the device, and how widely a device is used for accessing iview.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ABC appreciate that decisions to retire support can be disappointing for members of the public. The ABC endeavours to provide clear and visible information and advance notice of decisions to retire support, in collaboration with device manufacturers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners may wish to raise their concerns directly with the ABC, by writing to Audience and Consumer Affairs, GPO Box 9994, in their capital city, or by lodging a complaint at www.abc.ne.au/contact/complain.htm.<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>This will ensure that the ABC is directly aware of their concerns and has had an opportunity to respond to them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to the Committee. </span>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your letter of 18 February 2019 concerning petition EN0763 to request the House of Representatives to remove the race and condition restrictions on B12 hydroxocobalamin injections on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 1 January 2016, certain products that can be purchased over-the-counter (OTC) were delisted from general availability on the PBS â including the B12 hydroxocobalamin injections. The independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), following consideration of submissions from suppliers and consumer groups, recommended the delisting of these medicines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consumers can continue to buy these medicines at competitive prices from pharmacies without the need for a prescription.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to improving the capability of the PBS to meet the needs of Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander people. The PBAC assists by evaluating and recommending the listing of medications specifically for Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander people. In making its recommendation to delist B12 hydroxocobalamin injections, the PBAC recommended maintaining B12 hydroxocobalamin injections on the PBS for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients because of the extraordinary health challenges faced by these patients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This form of differential treatment does not constitute discrimination as it aims at achieving equality between racial groups. My Department has responded to a small number of complaints, including those made to the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), about the decision to delist from PBS general availability several OTC medicines. These complaints have alleged discrimination by continuing to provide subsidies for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for these medicines through the PBS. As of today, all complaints to the AHRC have been dismissed or withdrawn, following advice provided to the AHRC by my Department.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 February 2019, originally directed to the Treasurer, regarding petition number EN0770. As this matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities, your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has publicly stated it does not support Labor's policy to deny refundability of franking credits, as the then Treasurer noted in his press release of 13 March 2018.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Refundability of franking credits has been provided since 2001. When a company pays a dividend to its shareholders, it has the option of also providing a franking credit that recognises the tax the company has already paid on its income.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The franking credits can then be used by the shareholders to offset their tax obligation. Where a shareholder's offset is higher than their tax bill they receive a tax refund from the Australian Tax Office. Retirees and other low income earners are taxed at a lower rate than the 30 per cent rate paid by companies, so are often able to get a refund, as are entities like charities that are income tax exempt.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When introduced by the Howard Government in 2001 as part of the A New Tax System package, the original justification for introducing refundability into the imputation system was that it would ensure that the shareholder is taxed at their marginal rate as if they had derived the underlying profits themselves.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the Australian superannuation system, superannuation contributions are generally taxed at 15 per cent and investment earnings at 15 per cent prior to the preservation age. This concessional tax treatment provides an incentive for older Australians to remain in the workforce until they reach the preservation age if they wish to do so and to add to savings for their retirement. Superannuation benefits paid, either as an income stream or as a lump sum, from a taxed source (that is, one in which taxes have been paid in the fund on contributions and earnings), are tax free for people aged 60 and over.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 18 February 2019 regarding petition EN0787 to the House of Representatives requesting a review of the child support system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners may be interested to know that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs conducted an inquiry into the child support scheme. The Committee's report makes 25 recommendations relating to policy, legislation and administration of the child support scheme, family law (including the funding of family support services), and the enforcement of tax return lodgement. The report, <span style="font-style:italic;">From conflict to cooperation: inquiry into the Child Support Program, is </span>available on the Committee's website at www.aph.gov.au/childsupport.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's response to the Committee's recommendations was tabled in Parliament on 31 August 2016, and agrees with 18 of the 25 recommendations. This included enhancing existing support mechanisms, using new tools and information, and considering new insights and approaches to achieve improved outcomes for separated families. The Government's response is available on the Department of Social Services website at www.dss.gov.au/childsupportinquiryresponse.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;" />Progress is being made in implementing the agreed recommendations, with 12 recommendations completed to date. The three recommendations with the greatest impact for parents and children in the child support system were prioritised and included in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Act 2018.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation was passed by Parliament on 9 May 2018 and the various child support measures began either after the granting of Royal Assent (on 22 May 2018) or from 1 July 2018. These changes:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">strengthen incentives for parents to comply with court orders or participate in dispute resolution processes about care;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">enable amended tax assessments and changes that affect child support agreements to be more easily reflected without parents having to go to court; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">treat payees with overpaid child support more consistently with payers with debts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Of the remaining recommendations, three are being considered by other agencies and the others require a measured approach and careful consideration of the complexities involved.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to helping families manage their responsibilities for their children following separation and will continue to monitor the effect of child support legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter with me. I hope the information in this letter is of some help.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 18 February 2019, regarding Petitions EN0822, EN0799 and EN0789.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petitioners concerns regarding the certification of halal and non halal products, banning of live exports and exportation of baby formula.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In regards to petition EN0822, there are a range of third-party certification schemes operating in Australia to meet consumer preferences. The decision to obtain third-party certification to meet consumer values for products sold domestically is largely a commercial decision for businesses. This is true not only for halal certification but also the many other certification schemes in operation, including organic, fishery stewardship, ethical sourcing, environmental sustainability and animal welfare programs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2015, the Senate Economics References Committee completed an inquiry into third-party certification of food, including halal certification. Evidence received by the Senate Committee as part of the inquiry overwhelmingly showed that halal certification does not result in increased food prices. The government's response to the recommendations of the Senate committee's report was tabled on 2 August 2017. A copy of the report can be downloaded from the Parliament of Australia website aph.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government is committed to protecting Australia's well-earned position as one of the most successful and cohesive multicultural and multi-faith societies in the world. This success is based on respect for one another's human rights, the law and core values. Australia's approach to cultural and religious diversity recognises that our multicultural character gives us a competitive edge in an increasingly globalised world.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding Petition EN0799 about banning live animal exports. The Coalition Government remains absolutely committed to supporting our hard working farmers and regional communities, including those involved in the livestock export trade. The thousands of people who work in this industry would be unfairly affected by a full ban on the trade. I am taking necessary actions to improve animal welfare outcomes for exported livestock and strengthen regulatory oversight of exporters to make them more accountable for their actions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government supported the recommendations of the independent review conducted by veterinarian Dr Michael McCarthy in April 2018 into live sheep exports to the Middle East during the northern hemisphere summer. The review's recommendations are being implemented as a priority, including additional conditions being applied to sheep shipments to the Middle East, An independent Technical Advisory Committee has completed its review of the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock and has provided the final report to the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. I anticipate the report and the department's response to be released shortly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Lastly I note Petition EN0789, to restrict the exportation of baby formula. The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (the department) is responsible for the regulation of the export of Australian manufactured dairy products in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Export Control Act 1982 </span>and its subordinate legislation. All shipments of Australian manufactured infant formula exported in volumes of greater than 10 kilograms per individual consignment must meet strict manufacturing and export requirements, and must be issued with a permit by the department prior to export. Export of individual volumes less than 10 kilograms are not regulated, however the department believes the current regulatory settings are suitable to control the volume of legally exported Australian made infant formula.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The department also continues to work collaboratively with cross-border agencies to investigate allegations around exports of dairy products, including infant formula to China. The penalties in place under export legislation are considerable and where appropriate, include financial and penal provisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing your concerns to my attention. I trust this information is of assistance. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 18 February 2019 about Petition EN0792, regarding a proposed Federal Independent Commission Against Corruption. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 13 December 2018, the Australian Government announced that it would establish a new Commonwealth Integrity Commission (CIC) to strengthen integrity arrangements across the federal public sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CIC will be a centralised, specialist centre for the investigation of corruption in the public sector. It will also work with agencies to build resilience to corruption and bolster agency capability to detect, deter and investigate corrupt conduct.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CIC will be established as an independent statutory agency, led by a commissioner and two deputy commissioners. The CIC will comprise:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">a law enforcement integrity division â this will have the same functions and powers as the current Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, but with a broader jurisdiction</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">a public sector integrity division â this will investigate alleged criminal corruption involving government departments and their staff, parliamentarians and their staff, the staff of federal judicial officers, ' and in appropriate circumstances, recipients of Commonwealth funds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the proposal to establish the CIC, the Australian Government is targeting serious criminal corruption that presents a threat to good public administration. It will not duplicate the roles of existing bodies, but instead it will provide an expert investigative capability to respond to allegations of serious criminal corruption across the public sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government released a public consultation paper on the proposed model for the CIC and invited public submissions, which closed on 1 February 2019. The Australian Government is now considering the feedback. from the consultation in settling the final model for the new Commission.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your letter of 18 February 2019 concerning petition EN0793 presented in the House, requesting me to exercise my discretionary power to approve a new pharmacy in Cowra, New South Wales.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can confirm that my Department has recently received a request, from a pharmacist, for the exercise of my discretionary power to approve the supply of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) medicines at pharmacy premises in Cowra, New South Wales.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Legislation provides that I must decide whether or not to consider that request by 8 April 2019.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department will provide me with a submission, which includes the pharmacist's request, correspondence received in relation to the request and research by my Department. The petition will be included with that submission and I will take it into consideration when making my decision.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My discretionary power is designed to address circumstances where there is an unintended consequence of the Pharmacy Location Rules. I can only exercise my discretionary power if I am satisfied that a decision to not approve a pharmacist would result in a community being left without reasonable access to PBS medicines, and it is in the public interest to do so.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-weight:bold;" />Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 18 February 2019 regarding Petition EN0795 concerning the ability of religious and political organisations to discriminate in employment in accordance with their religious beliefs or political philosophy, respectively.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 13 December 2018, the Prime Minister and I released the Report of the Religious Freedom Review. The Prime Minister and I also released a comprehensive Australian Government response to the Review, focused on protecting Australians and their right to believe what they want to believe.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners raise concerns about exceptions to federal discrimination law that allow religious schools 'to only employ teaching staff who hold and demonstrate views in line with the founding principles behind the formation of the school'. As set out in its response to the Review, the Australian Government is consulting with the states and territories on the terms of reference for an inquiry by the Australian Law Reform Commission into this issue, and other relevant exceptions to anti-discrimination law. The Government's position is that Australia is a place where discrimination on the basis of a person's identity (including their religious identity) is unacceptable, but that it is also a place that respects the right of religious institutions to maintain their distinctive ethos.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under federal anti-discrimination law, it is not unlawful for a political party to require that staff members subscribe to that party's political philosophy. The Australian Government has no plans to amend this aspect of the law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your letter of 18 February 2019 concerning a petition (EN0797) to the House of Representatives to include dental care in Medicare.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dental treatment was not included under Medicare when it began and this policy has largely been continued by both sides of government. The Liberal National Government has no plans to include dental care under Medicare. The Government understands the importance of good oral health and its role in supporting general health and wellbeing. The Government is aware of the barriers to accessing affordable dental services and supports a range of targeted programs for adults and children to access care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is assisting children to access basic dental services through the Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS). Eligible children aged 2-17 years can access the CDBS for up to $1000 in benefits for basic dental services over two calendar years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also continues to support the states and territories to deliver public dental services for concession card holder adults through a National Partnership Agreement on Public Dental Services for Adults (the NPA). In the 2018-19 Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the Government committed an additional $107.8 million for a one year extension to the NPA. The extension will provide services to around 180,000 additional public patients. The NPA commenced on 1 January 2017 and will operate until 30 June 2020 providing $350.3 million and supporting services to around 580,000 public dental patients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The extension ensures that additional public dental services are supported, while the Government and the states and territories discuss securing sustainable and fair future funding arrangements beyond 30 June 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letters of 18 February 2019 regarding petitions EN0801 and EN0802 relating to protections for freedom of religion in religious schools.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister has affirmed that there is no more fundamental liberty than a person's right to decide what they do, or do not, believe. In this context, the Australian Government believes that all Australians should be free to choose their religion, and be entitled to express and practise their beliefs, without intimidation or interference, as long as those practices are within the framework of Australian law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 13 December 2018, the Prime Minister and I released the Report of the Religious Freedom Review. The Review concluded that there is an opportunity to further protect and better promote freedom of religion under Australian law and in the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister and I also released a comprehensive Australian Government response to the Review, focused on protecting Australians and their right to believe in what they want to believe. The response accepts 15 of the 20 recommendations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of that response, the Australian Government is consulting with the states and territories on the terms of a potential reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission on five recommendations relating to current religious exemptions under Commonwealth, state and territory anti-discrimination law. This includes exemptions for religious educational institutions, such as religious schools, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sex Discrimination Act 1984. </span>This approach is consistent with the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report on the Sex Discrimination (Removing Discrimination Against Students) Bill 2018, which recommended that the Government refer these exemptions to the Australian Law Reform Commission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The response reflects the Australian Government's belief that Australia is a place where discrimination on the basis of a person's identity (including their religious identity) is unacceptable, but that it is also a place that respects the right of religious institutions to maintain their distinctive ethos.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In this context, the Australian Government has stated that changes to the Sex Discrimination Act should make clear that discrimination against students is unacceptable, while at the same time ensuring religious educational institutions can teach and maintain rules consistent with their faith. This position recognises the important contribution of faith-based schools to our education system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;" />Thank you for your representation on behalf of the petitioners of EN0804 requesting the legalisation of the keeping of Ball Pythons (also known as Royal Pythons) as pets in Australia. The regulation of exotic reptiles as pets in Australia is complex. The Australian Government regulates the import of reptiles under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </span>(EPBC Act) and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources does not permit the import of live reptiles as domestic pets under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015. </span>More information is available from that Department through: www.agriculture.gov.au/about/contactus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The EPBC Act allows the import of the Royal Python <span style="font-style:italic;">(Python regius) </span>by zoos or other suitable institutions for exhibition, research, education or conservation breeding. The EPBC Act does not allow the python to be imported as a domestic pet. Information on the import of animals into Australia is on the Department of the Environment and Energy's website at: www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/wildlife-trade/live-import-list.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments are responsible for domestic regulation of the keeping of exotic animals, including reptiles, as pets within Australia. Most trading and keeping of snakes is illegal in Australia with, for example, New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory prohibiting the keeping of exotic reptiles as pets. Specific information about the keeping of Royal Pythons is available from each jurisdiction.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your representation on behalf of Petition EN0813, concerning withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol. I am pleased to provide you with my response below.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government takes its primary advice on climate science from the Bureau of Meteorology and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). This advice aligns with information provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other national and international organisations such as the Australian Academy of Science, the World Meteorological Organization, the National Academy of Sciences and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. These world leading scientific organisations have found that the Earth's climate is changing and humans are primarily responsible. This finding is informed by long-term observations of air temperatures, the heat content of the ocean, changes to glaciers, ice sheets and sea ice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to taking action in support of the international effort to address climate change, including through the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. Our 2030 target to reduce emissions to 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels is reasonable and economically responsible. It is in line with the efforts of other developed countries and it takes into account Australia's national circumstances. While Australia is only responsible for 1.3 per cent of global emissions, countries that each produce under 2 per cent together account for around 40 per cent of global emissions, so we need to do our part.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a strong record of meeting our emissions targets and has a comprehensive set of policies covering every sector of the economy. The Government has committed to developing a long-term climate change strategy to plan the transition towards a lower-emissions economy and, at the same time, provide sustainable, secure and affordable energy to industry and households.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning a petition on penalty rates, reference EN0816.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Responsibility for setting award wages and conditions, including penalty rates, sits with the Fair Work Commission, not the Australian Government or the Federal Parliament. Just as interest rate decisions are made independently by the Reserve Bank, decisions about employment awards are made by the Fair Work Commission. It is done this way to ensure outcomes are evidence-based and not political.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In February 2017, the Fair Work Commission decided that the levels of Sunday and public holiday penalty rates in five awards in the retail and hospitality sectors were not fair and relevant. Based on the evidence presented to it, the Fair Work Commission reduced some penalty rates for some workers, with the changes being phased in over three or four annual instalments from 1 July 2017.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Fair Work Commission did not completely cut Sunday or public holiday rates and the award rates are still higher than Saturday rates. In its decision, the Fair Work Commission said a reduction to penalty rates in the affected awards was expected to have a range of benefits for small businesses and jobs, including more hours of work for existing employees or the engagement of new employees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is not however possible to specifically disaggregate the employment impact of the Fair Work Commission's decision. Available data does not allow the reliable identification of workers who have their pay and conditions set by a specific modern award and who work on a particular day. Employment outcomes are also influenced by a range of other factors and the phasing in of the Sunday penalty rate changes on 1 July each year occurs at the same time as increases arising from the Fair Work Commission's Annual Wage Review take effect.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 February 2019 regarding Petition EN0836, presented to the Standing Committee on Petitions, raising concerns about the constitutionality and appropriateness of the use of judicial mediation in federal courts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The concerns have been raised in the context of the recently issued Practice Direction No. 1 of 2019 of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia (FCC), which sets out procedures and protocols for the use of judicial mediation in family law matters in the FCC. The petition requests that the House of Representatives legislatively clarify that judicial mediation shall play no role in the resolution of disputes arising under federal legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is an essential feature of the Australian system of government that our courts are independent and free of interference from the executive arm of government. Federal courts are each responsible for their own operation and management.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that Practice Directions are generally designed to provide information to litigants and legal practitioners on how the court manages its processes and procedures. Directions work in accompaniment with legislation and Rules of Court.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand that the arrangements for judicial mediation set out in Practice Direction No. 1 of 2019 of the FCC have been designed to complement the existing arrangements for the resolution of family law disputes in a way that is consistent with the proper role of judges and courts in our constitutional system. I also understand that the Direction was issued by the Chief Judge in consultation with the Court's Legal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing these concerns to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 18 February 2019 regarding petition EN0841, which requests that the House of Representatives reassess the changes made to the anti-siphoning scheme, consider reinstating the sporting events that have been removed from the anti-siphoning list, and investigate the impartiality and effectiveness of Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note petitioners' concerns about the details of the broadcast agreement between Cricket Australia, Seven and Fox Sports, announced on 13 April 2018. According to the agreement, Seven is broadcasting all men's Test matches and all women's internationals, as well as 43 men's and 23 women's Big Bash League (BBL) matches each season. Fox Sports will broadcast One Day Internationals (ODI), international Twenty20 (T20) matches, all BBL games, and women's internationals.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The rules relating to broadcasting rights for certain sports events are contained in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting Services Act 1992. </span>These rules, known as the 'anti-siphoning scheme', ensure that free-to-air broadcasters have first opportunity to acquire the rights to sporting events on the anti-siphoning list. However providing free-to-air broadcasters with this opportunity does not guarantee that an event on the list will be broadcast on free-to-air television.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The list of cricket events on the anti-siphoning list include:</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The anti-siphoning scheme operates as a license condition on subscription television providers (such as Fox Sports), preventing them from acquiring the rights to events on the anti-siphoning list until broadcast rights to the events are bought by a free-to-air broadcaster, or are automatically removed from the list 26 weeks before the event commences.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that free-to-air broadcasters are not required to buy listed events, or to broadcast the events they buy. They are also not prevented from subsequently selling some or all of the rights they buy to subscription television providers. These are commercial decisions for the broadcasters concerned, and the Government does not seek to intervene in such matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In this instance while the Seven Network has acquired the licence to broadcast domestic ODI and T20 games involving Australia it has chosen not to broadcast these games in favour of providing Fox Sports with exclusive coverage.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note your comments in relation to impartiality and effectiveness of the ACMA. The ACMA has a broad range of functions under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Communications and Media Authority Act 2005, </span>including to regulate broadcasting services: this includes undertaking general monitoring, compliance and investigative functions in relation to the anti-siphoning scheme. I was advised by the ACMA that the allocation of broadcast rights did not result in a breach of the anti-siphoning rules, and I am satisfied that the ACMA has discharged their statutory duties in relation to this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's Broadcasting and Content Reform Package, which passed the Parliament in late 2017, made a number of changes to the anti-siphoning scheme to enable it to operate more effectively in a digital media environment, while ensuring that events of national significance continue to be freely available.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to petitioners' concerns about a reduction in the number of events included on the anti-siphoning list, the Government's reform updated the list of events to only remove those where the history of rights acquisition of broadcasters, and audience viewing patterns, no longer warranted their inclusion on the list. I<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>note that the reforms did not include any changes to ODI or T20 cricket where those games are played in Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

I regret the delay in responding.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), the Australian Government subsidises the cost of medicine for most conditions. In 2017-18, expenditure on the PBS was more than $10 billion. To help meet the cost of the scheme, patients pay a co-payment for their medicines and the Australian Government pays the rest of the cost.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">States and territories are responsible for providing and funding public hospital services, including the supply of medicines to admitted patients. The Australian Government also provides significant funding to the states and territories to assist with the cost of providing hospital services. This includes access to subsidised PBS medicines for public hospitals through the Pharmaceutical Reform Agreements (PRAs).</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In states and territories participating in the PRAs, which excludes NSW and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), public hospitals access medicines subsidised by the Australian Government under two schemes:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">PBS General Schedule (s85) medicines for non-admitted patients or patients upon discharge from hospital; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">PBS s100 Efficient Funding of Chemotherapy (EFC) for day-admitted or non-admitted patients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The above two schemes are not available to ACT and NSW as these jurisdictions have chosen not to participate in the PRAs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the PRAs, patients may be charged a co-payment up to an amount that would be equivalent to the charge that would apply at a community pharmacy for the supply of PBS medicines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Separate to the PRAs, the Australian Government subsidises treatments for some cancers and chronic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and HIV through the PBS s100 Highly Specialised Drugs (HSD) program. The PBS s100 HSD program is available in all states and territories, including the NSW and ACT. A co-payment up to the equivalent of the PBS amount may be charged by the hospital for these medicines when supplied at a public hospital.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since 1 October 2015. the NSW Government has paid for the patient co-payments for s100 medicines, including non-PBS subsidised s100 injectable and infusible chemotherapy medicines and PBS subsidised s100 HSDs, for NSW residents who are patients of NSW public hospitals or authorised NSW community prescribers. These co-payment arrangements are measures put in place by the NSW Government specifically for NSW residents and health facilities (excluding private hospitals). The NSW model of funding the patient co-payment for s100 medicines is a decision for each state and territory government to consider. I note that the ACT established a similar program in 2018. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government funds the majority of the cost of PBS medicines for Australians and at this time there is no intention to remove PBS co-payments. It should be noted that since 1 January 2016 the Australian Government has provided pharmacists the option to discount the PBS co-payment by up to $1 providing further savings to consumers.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Electoral System</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 18 February 2019, referring petition number EN0760 to me as the Minister responsible for electoral matters. The petition requests that Australia's preferential system of voting be replaced by a first-past-the-post model. I do not support the petition's request for the reasons outlined below.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's system of preferential voting is designed to ensure the successful House of Representatives candidate receives the most votes and that votes for minor parties count towards the final result. Introduced in 1918, full preferential voting requires a candidate to build an absolute majority of support in an electorate rather than a simple majority as required by the first past-the-post method. In voting systems that do not allow preference allocation, a winning candidate needs to secure only the highest number of votes cast as compared to the other candidates, but this could be a small percentage of the overall votes cast, with no indication of majority support in the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2016 the Government made changes to Senate preferences through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Act 2016</span>, which simplified the Senate voting system by improving the ability for voters to express their voting intent. The legislation introduced partial optional preferential voting, with voters being instructed to number at least six squares above the line or at least 12 squares below the line.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These changes returned the control of preferences to voters. The previous system of Senate voting encouraged above the line voting, with voter preferences distributed through a complex and opaque system of group and individual voting tickets. It also required individuals choosing to vote below the line to number every square, even though their genuine preferences may have been exhausted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For these reasons, and taking account of the Government's existing priorities for electoral reform, I do not support the petition's request. Thank you for bringing the concerns referred to in the petition to my attention.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 18 February 2019, referring petition number EN0838 to me as the Minister responsible for electoral matters. The petition requests that the application fee and rules relating to political party registration be abolished. I do not support the petition's request for the reasons outlined below.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The party registration fee and rules are in place to ensure the integrity of the electoral process. Similar requirements, including a minimum number of eligible electors' support and a numeration fee apply to independent candidates. These requirements enhance transparency and public accountability of political parties and candidates and are in line with arrangements in other international jurisdictions such as New Zealand the United Kingdom.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, party registration is not compulsory. Parties can promote the election of their candidates to the Commonwealth Parliament without being registered. However, registration does provide political parties with certain benefits:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is worth noting that participation in the elections is not limited to candidates and parties. Many non-party aligned political actors also incur significant expenditure to influence the way electors vote in an election, including by promoting or opposing registered political parties, candidates and their policies. These entities are also subject to disclosure requirements with respect to their electoral expenditure, where they incur expenditure above the minimum threshold of $13,800 in a financial year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In November 2018 the Government passed the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Act 2018 (the Act). The Act made important reforms to the Federal electoral funding and disclosure regime to improve transparency and accountability for all participants in the electoral process, not just registered political parties. This included extending registration requirements to those non-party aligned political actors who incur significant electoral expenditure â those that qualify as political campaigners.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 18 February 2019 regarding petition number EN0842. The petition seeks changes to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 to restore the perceived loss of benefits payable under the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Like all Commonwealth defined benefit schemes, DFRDB was developed as a structured benefits scheme. DFRDB has a number of key features that include:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">payment of pension benefits on leaving the permanent forces after 20 years' service (irrespective of age);</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">a higher percentage of final salary as a pension compared to other schemes;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the ability to commute or exchange part of the pension for a lump sum;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the ability to receive lifetime indexed pensions with reversionary benefits to spouses and/or children or orphans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These are benefits that are not normally available without significant additional costs to the member. The DFRDB scheme compared favourably with other limited superannuation schemes of the day, and continues to recognise the unique nature of military service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For many years, retired military members and ex-service organisations, have sought to improve various elements of DFRDB and its replacement scheme, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS). These campaigns focus on single or discrete elements of the scheme without consideration of the overall benefit available to members upon retirement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The lifetime reduction of the DFRDB pension is consistent with arrangements in the other civilian and military superannuation schemes where a member elects to take all or part of their benefit as a lump sum instead of a lifetime pension. All the civilian and military superannuation schemes apply factors that take into account life expectancy. The way that they do this varies according to the design of the particular scheme. None of the schemes include a recalculation of the pension if a member reaches or outlives the life expectancy incorporated in the factor used to calculate the entitlement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst I acknowledge that the issues raised in the petition cause considerable concern amongst a group of the ex-service community, the Government does not support the proposed legislative changes to the scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Defence can confirm the existence of various application forms and fact sheets from the 1970s onwards that make clear the resulting permanent reduction of pensions following a member's election to commute. However, it is acknowledged that there are different views among some in the veteran community about the appropriateness of information provided to members at the time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Recognising the importance of open and transparent discussion around veteran concerns, the Government will commission an independent inquiry to examine the information provided by scheme administrators and relevant departments to members of the DFRDB scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will consult with the ex-service community about the terms of reference for the inquiry, as well as panel membership. Ex-Service Organisations and scheme members will have the opportunity to make submissions to the inquiry and raise any other concerns relevant to the scheme. The inquiry is on the agenda for the next Ex-Service Organisation Round Table, to be held on 2 April 2019.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you and the Committee.</span>

                    </a>  I'm doing a favour here! That concerns the financial statements of Commonwealth entities for the period ended 30 June 2017 and Audit report No. 48 of 2017-18, concerning compliance with foreign investment obligations for residential real estate. In the first part of its report, the committee made several recommendations reflecting the critical role that the Commonwealth financial statements play in providing accountability to the parliament and the public for the expenditure of public funds. In the second part of the report, the committee made recommendations to improve processes around management of the foreign investment regime for residential real estate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make some remarks on report No. 478, which discusses the committee's findings on Audit report No. 6 of 2018-19 concerning the issuing of a certificate under section 37 of the Auditor-General Act. I will sort of decode that and try to put it in English. Section 37 of the Auditor-General Act provides a rarely used power to the executive to gag the Auditor-General. It's been used only once in the history of the Commonwealthâin 1987, in the predecessor act, where the then Attorney-General, Gareth Evans, required the then Auditor-General to delete a small amount of information on the grounds of national security in relation to aircraft explosive ordnance. This was, in fact, the first time in the history of the Commonwealth that an Auditor-General was gagged by the executive to prevent him from expressing a value-for-money conclusionâin this case, on a multibillion dollar Defence Force acquisition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a serious inquiry and the issue has been explored also through Senate estimates because, of course, it could be quite concerning if this in any way set a precedent that prevented the parliament's scrutiny and understanding of the expenditure of vast sums of public money. In its report, the committee recommended that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit undertake an inquiry on any future occasion that a certificate is issued. We also considered a number of quite practical suggestions made by the Auditor-General, given this was the first time the provision had been used, that may improve the act in the future and have referred them to the next periodic review of the Auditor-General Act, which we expect will happen in the next term of parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, I suppose, to be balanced, the inquiry did find that the Attorney-General had not exceeded his powers under the act to issue the certificate, although the extent of the use of that power to gag the Auditor-General from expressing a value-for-money conclusion was not as had been anticipated when the act was put in place. In conclusion, I would highly recommend that you also read Audit report No. 478. It's a fascinating read!</span>

                  <a href="247130" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAUNDY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  Mr Speaker, on indulgence: well, it seems like only yesterday, although it was six years ago, that I stood right there and made my first speech in this place. Time flies when you're having funâand when you're having a horrible time. It's been a hell of a journey. I'd been to Canberra only once before being elected as a federal member of parliament. That was in 1982 for my year 6 school excursion from St Pat's at Strathfield. To say I didn't have a political background is probably the understatement of anyone sitting in this place. It was a very, very steep learning curve. I remember walking into my office and the first thing I looked for was a fridge. After all, I am the son of a publican and the grandson of a publican. I found the bar fridge there. You could, deadset, fit only six stubbies in it, and I thought, 'This isn't going to be good enough.' So I jumped in the car and headed off to Harvey Norman, locally here in Canberra, and I bought a massive fridge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was standing at the check-out, and the lady said, 'Would you like it delivered?' I said, 'Yes, please.' She said, 'Where to?' and I said, 'Parliament House.' She said, 'Whereabouts in Parliament House?' I said, 'That's a very good question.' So I googled how to ring Parliament House. I rang the switch and I said, 'If I were to have a fridge delivered there, where would I get it delivered to?' She said, 'The loading dock.' I said, 'Okay. How do I get to the loading dock?' and she said, 'I can put you through.' So I spoke to the gentleman at the loading dock and said: 'Mate, I'm going to have a fridge delivered there this afternoon. I'm in RG 83. How do I arrange to get it moved to that office?' He said, 'Mate, I take the deliveries here, but, once it lands on the loading dock, it's your responsibility.' I said, 'Well, have you got something I can put it on?' He said, 'We've got a trolley.' If I had a dollar for every fridge I've moved around in my life, I could retire tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first time I ran into Canberra staffâthe amazing staff in Parliament Houseâwas in the basement. I don't know if any of you've been down in the basement. It is a citadel. There are thousands of people running around the place. I went down to the loading dock, got a trolley, put the fridge on the trolley, manoeuvred down the corridor, put it in the lift, came upstairs and ran into Alan. Alan said to me, 'What are you doing?' I said: 'Mate, these fridges here are crap. I need a fridge that can handle some grog.' He said: 'Right you are. Are you okay? Can I give you a hand?' I said, 'No, I'm sweet.' I moved the fridge in, and that fridge in RG 83âthat office, RG 83âbecameâ</span>

                  <span class="HPS-GeneralInterjecting">A government member:</span>  You didn't leave it there?</span>
              </p>

                  <a href="247130" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr LAUNDY:</span>
                  </a>  I didn't leave it there. It became the social centre of that first term. For the class of 2013, it was right opposite the party room. In other words, I brought being a publican to Canberraâsomething I'm so, so proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When elected I owned only one suit. It was charcoal, because that was a blended colour. Why? Because I could wear it to weddings and funerals. I had only a couple of ties. In 23 years of working in my family's business, I never wore a tie. Why? Because in a punch-up, they're deadlyâthey grab them, they pull them down and it's uppercut central. That's where I come from. It's for that reason, with that zero background, that I want to start tonight by thanking the amazing staff here at Parliament House. I was so green it ain't funny! And they have been so, so good to me. My father, my grandfather and our family business's ethosâand, touch wood, we have been successfulâis that the most valuable asset we have ever had at our disposal has been our amazing staff, and nothing could be truer of the set of staff here at Parliament House. The clerks, David and Claressa; Pete; James; Catherine; Bronwyn; the two guys, Stephen Boyd and Jerome Brown, I dealt with in committees that I chaired; and the amazing Serjeant-at-Arms staff, Rod, Lynnette, Mike and Tracy: for all the assistance you have given me over six years, I will never be able to thank you enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was elected first as a local member, and I had a ball. It was obviously a great story. It was a seat that the Labor Party had held for some 91 years. I managed to pry it from their hands and at the last election, when things didn't go so great for us in New South Wales, I managed to get returned with a swing to me, which I will never forget. But the thing that has struck me as a local memberâand I've been one now for 3Â½ of the six yearsâis that you can actually get stuff done locally. I look back at some of my proudest achievements. I said in my maiden speech we have a real issue in this country with multicultural aged care. We don't do enough in this space. I know that at the 2013 election the Lakemba mosque had been promised money for an aged-care centre and the Maronite community was promised money for an aged-care centre. Both of those still have that money sitting in their bank accounts. I managed to convince Minister Fifield to get me money for the Gallipoli Mosque at Auburn, and the Gallipoli aged-care centre has now been opened. Minister Wyatt was with me when we opened it. It is the first aged-care centre in Australia that is based in the Islamic faith. What a thrill that is, not just because of the 96 bed licences that are in there but because that joint has become a beacon for the whole community, offering out-care right next to the mosque so people can practise their faith. This is the part of Sydney and the part of Australia that I proudly come from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From big projectsâmajor infrastructure like WestConnexâdown to local roads and the roundabouts on Burlington Road at Homebush: that's the scale of stuff you can actually get done for the local community. The local sports groundsâAbbotsford soccer club, Burwood soccer club, West Harbour rugby club, Strathfield Park, Cintra netballâhave been delivered through hard work and advocacy. That's not peculiar to me. We all do the same in this place, giving back to our local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a local member, for me the highlightâand it was the irony of the time I was electedâwas absolutely the Centenary of Anzac celebrations. In my electorate, we used that moneyâas I know you all did. One of my war memorials was 105 years oldâsorry, centenary; wrong way!â95 years old. The footings were gone, the tuck pointing was gone and the roof was falling down. It now looks like the Ritz and will be there for another 100 years. These are the amazing things you can deliver locally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My ministerial journey was first as the federal minister responsible for multiculturalism. I deadset enjoyed this, given the make-up and the profile of my seat. Prime Minister Turnbull entrusted me with the role at a timeâand, sadly, we've been dragged back into it at the momentâwhen we were countering violent extremism. ISIS was brand new. It was front and centre. Islamic extremism was brand new. The Islamic community in Western Sydney and western Melbourne felt under attack, and the solution wasn't through the Attorney-General's office or policing agencies. Yes, both communities worked hand-in-hand with them for intelligence, but it needed the soft sell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Morrison at the time, now Prime Minister Morrison, was smart enough to understand through his connections with the community that that was the place where those dollars needed to be parked and that was the place where these programs needed to be developed. That was why I was so incensed recently. I spoke to Scott. I know how much Scott has done. I know the breadth and the strength of his connections in Sydney's Islamic community. I was with him the night after Tony, you and Jaseâforgive me, Mr Speaker, there'll be a lot of names without seats tonight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  Okay. Just this once.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247130" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr LAUNDY:</span>
                  </a>  I was at the Lakemba mosque with the grand mufti, Sheikh Shady and Samier Dandan and all of our friends in the Islamic community. I saw them embrace then Minister Morrison with open arms. I heard you listen to them. I heard you speak to them. I was filthy, mate, that that's what they were focusing on when I know how much you've done for that community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I then moved on to Industry, Innovation and Science. Christopher said it this afternoon. I was responsible for finishing off implementation of the National Innovation and Science Agenda. I had a ball. I ran into Glenys Beauchamp and her staff in Industry, Innovation and Scienceâsorry, I should have said before Finn Pratt and his staff in multiculturalism. We had a lot of fun. That space is obviously extremely important, and we need to keep investing in it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I had the absolute pleasure again to be a minister. You've heard me tonight make mention of family business and my passion for it. I said to Bruce Billson in my maiden speech that I thought the Minister for Small Business, at that stage for 112 years, had been misnamed. I thought that should be the minister for small and family business. Some four years later I received a phone call from Prime Minister Turnbull and he said, 'Mate, we need you to do a couple things, but we don't know what to call itâsmall business, industrial relations and deregulation.' The first thing I said was, 'Can we please call it small and family business?' It's a unique thrill to not only say something in your maiden speech and see it happen but then be the first-ever minister that this country has had for small and family business. My great hope, whoever wins the next election, is that, for the history of time to come in this country, family businesses are not forgotten, because, although family businesses may get big, they are still very much run through principles that were ingrained when they were small.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to say, in that time, in an economic policy, it was a real buzz, because it gave me the opportunity to drive a change in culture through a department. I would argue that, since Federationâand, today, 118 years laterâwe have always tended to default in this place to our regulatory cap. That's how we think: how can we regulate? I would argue that weâthe government of the day, irrespective of which sideâare a business partner. Depending on your ownership structure, we own between 25 and 49 per cent of that business, so the more we can get out of the wayâreduce compliance costs, make it quicker, cheaper and easierâthen that line item in your profit and loss statement will decrease and the profit will increase. And guess what? We clip the ticket. That will give us more revenue in the economy that we can then spend on essential services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was for that reason that one of my greatest thrills was when I pitched to Malcolm, 'Can I use technology to simplify the way business interacts with government?' and he said, 'Yes, you can.' Kelly O'Dwyer gave me permission to take some of her stuff that she was doing, and we worked with Victor Dominello in New South Wales. It used to take 18 months to open a bar, restaurant or cafe in the Parramatta LGAâlocal government areaâin New South Wales in the country of Australia. You had to fill in and comply with 59 different forms. We asked whether we could use technologyâVictor was right on board, as was Parramatta Councilâand it now takes you three weeks to open the same business. That's 17 months and one week that business is, hopefully, doing two things: making a quidâand we clip the ticketâand paying wages, and we clip the ticket. You and I have had this discussion, Ed. And you mentioned this with policing and technology use, Michael. I hope that in our economic portfolios, especially as we do our 31 business registries, for example, in the next term of government, as we modernise and move those into this century's structure, we can have business front and centre of mind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My favourite parts of being an MP, first and foremost, are the friendships. I'm thrilledâoverwhelmed, actuallyâto have so many people in the chamber tonight, on both sides of the aisle. And the Independents! My mates in the class of 2013 have been an unbelievable team. We have dinners on Monday nights. Each Monday sitting night, we've been each other's confidants; we have gathered together since day one. We lost comrades at the last election, and some are in the gallery tonight. We've all kept together and kept strong. My mates in the Nationals are a very, very unusual crew but I love 'em! As the son-in-law of a cattle farmer, I've always understood them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="247130" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr LAUNDY:</span>
                  </a>  Exactly. In terms of Christmas parties and singing karaoke with Matt Canavan, 'Jessie's Girl' is something we did every yearâno problems at all. You know the drama, though? This is something Australia doesn't see enough of: it's not just friendships that I've been lucky to make on this side; it's friendships I've been lucky to make on the other side. Again, I'm so thrilled to see so many here tonight. You've become great mates. Reid, at the moment, is an island of blue in a sea of red. You will all know that in your own seats the people you most interact with are your electoral neighbours. I'm surrounded by three blokes who have become real good mates: Albo, Tony Burkeâwho was a year ahead of me at St Pat's at Strathfieldâand Jason Clare. I would see these blokes outside of here a couple of times a week. We have worked together, especially at times when parts of our communities were fractured and under pressure. We have worked together, side by side, to keep people calm on both sides of the fence, as well as locally. I want to say a special thankyou to those three guys for always putting party politics aside for the sake of the communityâagain, something that's not seen often enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make special mention of Jase Clare. Jase is a great mate of my family. A night before I was electedâI had not met him but he was a great friend of Dad'sâI got a phone call late at night from Jase. He said: 'Mate, this will be a whirlwind. Are you available for a cup of tea so I can run you through what I think you should do and how you should do it?' The measure of you, Jase, is not just that you did that but that you and I have become great mates. You, Louise and your little bloke have become our great mates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My second part of being a local member was immigration. You win some and lose some. We all know that, especially in our part of Sydney. The wins stick with you. I had a Korean family that was 24 hours away from being deported because a migration agent had stuffed up a paper 10 years ago. They had kids in selective high school and one kid playing golf with the New South Wales under-16s females squad. That family are still here. But you also lose some, which is tough. I had a Pakistani guy full of bone cancer. We tried to get his wife and kids out of a camp in North Pakistan, basically to come and say goodbye. I lobbied the minister at the time. I offered to pick them up at the airport and make sure they got on the plane when they went home. But I knew I wouldn't win. Ultimately Suzie and I ended up buying that gentleman a one-way ticket to go home, full of medication, and, sadly, die with his family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My two biggest wins in immigration, without doubt, as far as I see it, included the increase of 12,000 additional Syrian refugees when it really got willing over thereâit's still willing, but it really got willing. The photo that Soph showed me at the time of a baby on the edge of the water, drowned, prompted me to talk to the relevant ministers and we got a result. The second one was with my great mate the member for McMillan, who's probably here somewhere. He and I went and saw you, Scott, and suggested that it would be a good idea to get the kids off Nauru. You were good enough, mate, to do that. I see that as a great win.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My third favourite part is schoolkids. Why? Because, quite simply, they are the hope of the side. If you think God doesn't have a sense of humour, my last school visiting here is Meriden School from Strathfield, where my two daughters went. I think that's fantastic. The last of my favourite parts is citizenship ceremonies. There is the look on people's faces as they become Australian citizens. Talking to them afterwards and listening to their stories, knowing full well that that day their stories become part of our story, is a thrill.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The worst part of being an MP is simply the fact that you are away from your family and you put them last. You do. Analise, as late as December, would have her end-of-year assembly. The reality is that, in a marginal seat, and I was still up in the airâher school votes for me. There are no votes to swing there. So I went to Concord High School's assembly, which clashed with hers. Why? Because it's in a key swing zone of the electorate. Sadly, if there's a function or whatever that you have to go to, that's often what you end up doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a list of thankyous. Firstly, I thank Mike Baird for inspiring me, challenging me and then supporting me non-stop from day one. He's the reason I'm here. I thank John Brogden for not talking me out of it, although he took hours trying, and then supporting me through my preselection. I thank Joe Tannous and Michael Photios for helping me with my preselection when I knew nothing of the Liberal Party. I thank Neil Harley, who spent a year as my campaign director and then four years as my chief of staff, and then got poached by Gladys Berejiklian to run her campaign two years ago. I would have argued, pre two Saturdays ago, that I always thought that he has one of the sharpest political minds of anyone that I will ever meet, and I think the result Saturday week ago would pay testament to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my FEC presidents, Sandra Blackmore and Gulian Vaccari. You have been amazing supports, as have been all the rank and file in Reid for six years. They took me on trust. I came from the outside to within and they decided to take a punt on me. I hope that I haven't let them down. Gules is also the Mayor of Strathfield and I've worked closely with him. My two state members when I came into parliament were Libs. John Sidoti is still there and was promoted last week to the ministryâso well deserved; such a good mate, my Italian brother. He and his family have been a great support. Charles Casuscelli was there from 2011 to 2015 but, sadly, lost in 2015. Charles was an amazing support through that time. His replacement, Jodi McKay, was cut from the other side of the cloth, but Jodi is a wonderful local member whom I've worked closely with to come up with local solutions. Mayors John Faker and Angelo Tsirekas are, again, Labor mayors whom I've worked with closely to deliver for local communities, as well as Mayors Ronnie Oueik and Ned Attie.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say a big thankyou to my former industry. In the gallery tonight we have John Whelan, Steve Ferguson, Dave Currie, Anthony Ball and Anthony Tremaci. I thank the clubs and pubs and the hospitality industry more broadly. There are two things. Firstly, they were amazed that I was crazy enough to want to do this, but, secondly, they never stopped supporting me. Guys, thank you very much, and I thank the industry more broadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are all of my staffâI have two lots, obviously: my EO staff; two vintages. The first iteration was from 2013 to 2016. I've mentioned Neil Harley. Dom Meoli is up there tonight, as are John Borman and Dave Tanti. Mike Morrow came on board. Alex Lucas has been a mainstay over the six years. He's here with his parents tonight. Sneha Subramaniam and Marc Snape are amazing; they became part of the family. Welcome to family business, guys, albeit politics! The second iteration included Vanessa Papastavros, Olivia Simpson, Matt Harrington and Aaron, who runs my life. Guys and girls, thank you very much for the six years of working with me and putting up with me.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to my friends. Manning booths is a tough gig in a marginal seat, especially with an ageing conference, and I've had friends turn out in droves. The first one wasn't too bad, because the campaign was in spring. The second one was brutal, because it was eight weeks long and in winter, but friends who believed in me and wanted to support me turned up in big numbers, and I will be eternally grateful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to my family. They've thrown me off kilter a little, because I thought only Suz was coming today and I've ended up with two of my three kids, Soph and Charlie, and my father, Arthurâhe's probably more comfortable on your side over there, guys.</span>

I spoke about them all extensively when I made my maiden speech, and my children are nowâwhat?âsix years older. Charlie is now almost 21 and Soph is 20, so they were here at 14 and 13 when I made my maiden speech. I said at the timeâand if you look up at them tonight you'll see that not only was it true then; it's even truer tonightâthat I'm doubly blessed: not only do they take after their mum but they look like her too.</span>

I look forward to the challenges that we will face in the future and I'm very excited about coming home.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We are all ultimately a product of our upbringing and education, and I have been blessed to attend three magnificent schools. The mottos of these three schools have always been a guide to the way I have lived my life. They best capture the way I will work to repay the faith that the people of Reid have shown in me. At Santa Maria Del Monte in Strathfield it was 'Veritas', which means 'truth'. At St Patrick's College in Strathfield it was 'Luceat Lux Vestra', which means 'let your light shine'. And at St Joseph's College at Hunters Hill it was 'In Meliora Contende', which means 'strive for better things'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish you, Scott, and the team all the very best. I've been blessed to serve under you as Prime Minister and under Malcolm as Prime Minister. Obviously, Malcolm is an extremely close mate, and what happened in August last year was tough. To his credit, Tony Abbott worked tirelessly to get me elected in the first place. To those of you who are prepared to write him off in the seat of Warringah: I think you can think again. I absolutely respect the guy and he's a fighter from sun-up to sundown.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish you all the best with whatever comes. I wish everyone in this chamber all the best. I laughed with Paul FletcherâI don't know if Fletcher's hereânot long ago in question time. There's a common complaint when you leave politics that your phone stops ringing. I looked at Fletch and said, 'If only I had that problem.' I like good people. I've been surrounded in this place, on both sides, by good people. If I can ever be of assistance to any of you moving forwardâif it's on the other side of the chamber it will probably be through Dadâplease don't hesitate to give me a yell.</span>

Tonight I'm borrowing it. I want to finish by saying: the record shows I took the blows, and did it my way. Thank you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the Australian public hate politicians. For the first time since Federation, we have had agreement from the basin states in the Commonwealth on the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. When I became minister 15 months ago, I wanted to take the politics out of water. It had to be about leadership. I have to acknowledge the member for Watson, who's sitting opposite, for the leadership that he showed with me. The two million Australians that live up and down the Basin Plan are fatigued. They've had a gutful. They want certainty. The water wars needed to end. And near the end of the 45th Parliament, we sit in this chamber, this great chamber, with great history and great relevance to the Australian people, and we revert to the politicisation of this most important piece of environmental reform. This is the biggest environmental program in our nation's history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of continuing on the pathway of bipartisanship for a plan that was created in 2012, at a point when I was not even in this parliamentâas a minister who lives in an electorate that's been impacted by the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and as a member of parliament who has seen the fatigue and hurt in the lives of those people who have been impacted by thisâI find it abhorrent that we are now standing here trying to tear down the very Basin Plan that we all agreed on. It's not a perfect plan. I acknowledge that in fact the member for Watson was the architect, but I'm delivering it. That's leadership. That is what this nation wants. That is what the Australian people want. They are sick and tired of state against state. To belittle the Australian public and to bring us into conflict, state against state, brother against brother, is something I thought this parliament was above. I thought the people within this parliament were above that. To politicise this for cheap political gain by a political party in South Australia that has political irrelevanceâit is at the fringe of relevance in South Australiaâand to try to pit state against state again sets this nation back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an opportunity for our nation to be led by its politicians, not torn apart. I've never yelled. I've never screamed. I've always made sure we got to this point with bipartisanship. Before I became minister, let me say, the likelihood of delivering the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was next to zero. It took leadership, and that is what I want to continue to deliverânot to let those who want to take advantage for their own political gain in their own electorates try to tear down something that is so important to this nation, to this nation's future and to the certainty of two million Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I sat in a small country town in my own electorate and I held in my arms a 68-year-old man whose town has basically been decimated by buybacks. He owned a small business. He owned a small business that was his superannuation. After 40 years, that business was worth nothing. This man was beside himself. He told me he had nothing to live for. He had nothing left. For a South Australian senator to try to tear away that man's future, that man's certainty, to gain a political point in this place, to bring the parliament of this nation down, is something we should never be proud of. You should never be proud of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't a perfect plan. There's been pain up and down the basin. We all acknowledge that. But let me tell you: if you tear away at this, you will have nothing. For those from South Australia, let me tell you: we've recovered approximately 2,100 gigalitres. If you want to tear away at this plan now, that'll be it. That's all you'll get. The reality is that, unless we have the basin states with us, we won't deliver the plan. So your motion is more about politics than reality. It would be easy for me as a Queenslander, as someone who represents nearly all of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in Queensland, to sit here and say, 'No more; let's tear it apart.' I could do that. But do you know what? That's not the right thing to do. That's not the right thing to do by those people in Queensland. It's not the right thing to do by anybody. We're above this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What you would invariably do is put at risk this fragile peace that has taken so long to achieve, with hard work and with leadership, not only from the federal level and from those on the other side but also from state ministers. For the first time we have had state ministers from all political persuasions agree with the management of this plan. That took courage. That took leadership. I said to those ministers when we got through the Northern Basin Review, the sustainable diversion limits and the 450 gigalitres of up water: 'We have to take a leap of faith with one another. We have to trust one another. For the first time since Federation, we have to take each other's hands and we have to lead.' They did. And now you want to tear it apart. That's something none of us should be proud of. I thought this place was better than that. I thought that we could continue on the pathway of a plan that's not perfect but is one that would deliver outcomes. We had leadership from the states that understood clearly that they had to look outside their state boundaries, and they have. I need to acknowledge former New South Wales water minister Niall Blair for his leadership. It was so easy for the parochialism of each state to stand tall and to call each other names so that the plan didn't progress. It took real leadership and courage for him to stand tall with Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and the ACT and say, 'We've had enough.' That's what we are here to doâto lead. Niall Blair led. So did Lisa Neville. She led and so too did David Speirs, the South Australian minister. He could easily be doing what those from the Centre Alliance are trying to do today to try to gain a cheap political point. He could walk out in front of the Adelaide media and say that he stood up for South Australia and he's going to work for South Australia at the expense of all other states. But he didn't. He showed leadershipânot a cheap political stunt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that David Speirs is one of the most courageous politicians I've seen. He didn't have to come in on any of this. He could have continued on the journey that Ian Hunter was on and was committed to, but instead he thought about the delivery of the plan. It wasn't just about getting as much water across the barrage. More importantly for him, it was also about the environmental benefits up and down the basin. The blunt instrument that we've created in everyone's mind is that to make the plan work we have to get as much water across the barrage as we possibly can. It's not. There are an enormous number of ecosystems up and down the basin that we are getting environmental outcomes on. It's not just a blunt instrumentânot just a cheap political instrument to try to win some points when coming up to an election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Murray will testify, I could have gone out only two weeks ago and stood in front of a hundred angry irrigators who were baying for blood and asking for the plan to pause. I could have gone with the pack. I could have said to them: 'I'm with you. Let's pause the plan and break it up.' But I didn't. The easiest thing for me to do was to fly in there and tell them what they wanted to hear and then never see them again. Instead, I looked them in the eye and told them the truth. I didn't play gamesâI told them the truth. This plan hurts me; it hurts my people. That 68-year-old man is still hurtingâthat man who lives in Western Queensland and worries about his future. I could have done the easy thing. I could have walked away and said: 'You know what? I'm going to blow it up.' But that's not the right thing to do. That's not the right thing for any of us to do. The right thing to do is to stick the course, as ugly as it is, as hard as it is. That's our job as leaders of this nation: to lead the nation and not divide it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is proposed tonight will be a step back from the cliff that we were about to fall over before we came to a bipartisan approach to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, on 7 May last year. We instigated a northern review and the sustainable diversion limitâin fact, a world first in our nation's history of a $40 million Indigenous fund. I sat in St George last week with the elders. Ronnie Waters, a great mate of mine, is a great Indigenous elder in St George, a man who cares about his community and cares about his culture. He understands the economic impacts for his people in St George if we continue down the path of destroying this plan. He's had enough. His people have lost opportunities. But the member for Watson and I were able to get to a point where we brought our First Australians with usâand rightly so. They'd been forgotten in this plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You tear away the $40 million economic plan we have also put in place. If one state falls out of this, the whole thing dominoes. To anyone who says that doesn't happen: let me tell you, it does. I've faced those ministers. I understand the parochialism. We hold this by a thread because of the leadership that we have shown. It's important that we don't blink. As soon as we blink, as soon as we allow politics to creep back into this, we bring back uncertainty and we destroy the lives, again, of two million Australians who expect us to lead. They pay us to lead, to come into this place and work for outcomes, not for our own political glory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The greatest achievement I think I'll ever make in my life is to get the Northern Basin Review throughâthe sustainable diversion limit and the 450 neutrality testâbecause those two million Australians expect it. No matter what else I've achieved, I've achieved that. I can go back and sit in the shop of that 68-year-old man, and look him in the eye and tell him that I led for him. There are more like him right up and down the basin. There's a whole generation that we owe it to to continue the pathânot only the ones that are there now but the next ones to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to divide this nation if we do not use this as a defining moment to continue to come together as a nation and push away the fringe elements that want to destroy it, that want to tear away at the very fabric of what is so great about this nation. When we look down Anzac Avenue and see that memorial to what those brave men and women have fought for, we should respect it in this place. We should respect it by delivering certainty and by giving outcomes. We're a great nation. But, if we continue to tear each other apart to win a vote, then, I'm sorry, we tear away at this nation; we tear away at what we are and what we've become. I say to each and every one of you here tonight: we have an opportunity to lead or divide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been clear. I've got to look my people in the eye. I've been honest with them every step of the way. You need to look them in the eye and be honest. It's not a perfect plan. I acknowledge the work the member for Watson has put into this. He's the architect. It's a legacy that he will leave. It's a legacy I want to leave because I've delivered it, as imperfect as it is to that 68-year-old man who sits out in western Queensland tonight, scared about his livelihood and his future. He's important. He's as important as any other Australian in this country. If we don't lead tonight, then we've let him and everyone else down.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the member for Mayo as the seconder, which, obviously, will happen at the conclusion of my speech. This has come from the Senate and was originally moved by members of Centre Alliance, her party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should, after what the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources just said, explain what the resolution actually says. The resolution, first of all, notes a finding from the royal commission that I don't agree with. This particular recommendation is one that would, in fact, undo the original agreement of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan; that is, that the additional 450 gigalitres be achieved through general tender buyback. A lot of people will say that that is the most efficient way to get the water, and my original premise that I took to the negotiations when they took place was for that water to be attained through buyback. The exact people who the minister referred to as the people we need to be listening to are the people who persuaded me, including the state ministers at the time, that additional water of that nature should be obtained through on-farm infrastructure projects. That's how that water should be obtained. This resolution simply notes that recommendation. If it asked the parliament to back that recommendation, I'd be recommending that we vote against it because it would be a breach of the agreement and it would be a breach of the plan. But it doesn't ask that; it simply notes that recommendation. What the resolution before us does ask the parliament to endorse is a call on the federal government to support the urgent repeal of the cap on buybackâthe 1,500 gigalitre limit on buyback.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, when the minister said, 'For the first time we now have agreement between the states on how the plan should be implemented,' that was not strictly true. We had agreement when the plan was introduced. That agreement disappeared for a period while the member for New England was the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. The minister at the table has worked very hard, to his great credit, to get agreement back on track with the states and across the aisle. I pay tribute to him for that. But it is untrue to say that now is the first time that we've had that sort of agreement; it's not. But it did have to be retrieved, and he's done that work. The reason I say that is not, 'Here's a bit of rhetoric; let's have an argument about it.' It's for this reason: when the original agreement for the plan was put in place, there was no cap on buyback. The cap on buyback was introduced as an election commitment designed by the member for New England, the very person who caused the whole thing to almost collapse. So I don't accept that a promise made by the person who tried so actively to undo the whole plan can be seen as something that is integral to holding the whole thing together. I can't logically accept that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing is: what does a cap on buyback mean? When the cap on buyback first went through, the government had just been elected and they had a mandate for it. We didn't oppose it in the Senate on the basis that where it was set was above where the take was expected to get to anyway, so the cap on buyback was something that had a rhetorical value but didn't in fact have any impact in substance. Since that time we've had two amendments to the plan which were within the parameters of the original agreement. It was said there would be a Northern Basin Review and it was said that there would be things called supply measures which would bring the numbers down. The Northern Basin Review came back with numbers that I didn't like, that I never expected, but they came from the independent authority and were within the parameters of the original agreement, so we agreed for them to go through a negotiation with the minister. The supply measures give a 605 gigalitre reduction in the total amount, and there is some doubt as to the extent to which those supply measures will be fully realised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, here is the catch, and this is where the cap on buyback becomes a real issue that will hit the plan in the next few years. If there is a cap on buyback, the states will know they don't have to go hard on delivering the supply measures they put forward because they have this seatbelt that says, 'If you don't actually deliver, not much can happen under the plan anyway because there's a cap on buyback.' If the cap is removed, we may well find that we never needed to use it anyway because the pressure will be on the states to deliver those supply measures. That's what will happen, because they know full well that, if they don't deliver, buyback becomes a live option. What incentive is there for the states other than how much Commonwealth money they get to take if they know that, whether or not they deliver the supply measures, the Commonwealth has no recourse because there's a statutory limit on buyback?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this has a real outcome. The reason the numbers were allowed to be reduced is that supply measures provide effective ways of delivering under the plan equivalent environmental outcomes using less water. They provide the exact sorts of outcomes the minister was saying we should be able to do to listen to the communities. Whether they're fully delivered or not matters. The reason we need them to be fully delivered is that they go to the health of the basin. We need to get right back to first principles here. Why did the Keating government set up a ministerial council? Why did the Howard government put the Water Act in place? Why did the Gillard government put in place a Murray-Darling Basin Plan? Why, under the Turnbull government, did this minister work so hard to keep it alive? The reason is that the major river system on our continent is at risk of collapse. There are no jobs on dead rivers. If you have ecological collapse, the communities don't get their agriculture water and they don't get their drinking water and you get all the knock-on impacts from that. If you think ecological collapse is an exaggeration then look at the summer we've just had. The need for the plan to be fully delivered is real.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This cap now creates a disincentive for the states to deliver those supply measures. So, please, don't come in here and argue that this is an attempt to have buyback all over the place, because the plan doesn't allow that. I've ruled that out. And, with respect to the 450 gigalitres, the plan doesn't allow a drop of that 450 gigalitres to be through general tender buyback. Those supply measures will only be delivered if the states have an incentive to deliver them. If they don't deliver them and there's a cap on buyback, the river will just take the cut and the ecological collapse that we saw over summer will become an annual event. Don't think it can't happen, because we've watched the beginnings of it happen. This is no ordinary drought. The in-flows are dropping and, as the in-flows to the basin are dropping, the extent to which what once was simply an overallocation now becomes an overextraction that imperils the future of the rivers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't accept the argument that somehow by keeping to the original plan we're playing a political game. I can't accept that. Ultimately, no matter how we negotiate back and forth across the aisle, the rivers have commenced negotiating back, and they are the most uncompromising of all. So I urge members to vote for the amendment that I've moved and the member for Mayo will second, even if you hope that total buyback never goes beyond where the current cap is. By removing the cap you guarantee that the supply projects will happen. I know people will go to their electorates and will want to run a different argument, but this plan was put in place to make sure that the rivers are restored to health and that it's done in a way that works with communities. The cap on buyback is the one part of this that was nothing more than an election commitment concocted by the member for New England.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  I second the amendment. The most economically efficient way for the federal government to help the river is to return more water to the system through water buybacks. This is more efficient than infrastructure or efficiency spends. The water buyback cap was put in place by this government. It was not part of the original plan and it should be removed. Why shouldn't a small irrigator be able to sell to whomever they want? Over here, you talk about free market all the time. That is a free market. If they want to sell their water allocation to the government and benefit the river, why should we, in this place, stand in their way? Is it because the large irrigators are saying one thing to government? Well, I think so. It does not suit their interests but it does suit the river. This government, as I think we've seen, does not care about the little guys any more. It certainly doesn't care about the end of the river, the most vulnerable part of the river.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources wants us to stop talking about politics. That's fine; let's talk about science. That is something we don't talk about enough in here. The Australian Academy of Science released a detailed report on the Menindee fish killsâthe investigation of the causes of the fish kills in the Menindee region, New South Wales, over the summer of 2018-19. I tabled this report in the House in February this year. A key recommendation of the academy's expert panel was that the government should:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the minister and his government cannot cherrypick which parts of science they want to follow. You need to follow the science as it is, and this was the expert panel's position:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission provides yet more evidence that repealing the water buybacks is an urgent and necessary step. Recommendation 8 from the royal commission says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Future water recovery for the environment, including the 450 GL, should be purchased through buyback. This requires repeal of the 1500 GL cap on buybacks in sec 85C of the Water Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the minister that the cap was not there in the original plan in 2012; it was part of the thought bubbles of the then Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, the member for New England. It was not there in the original plan. So let's be very clear as to what was in the original plan and then what was distorted by this government.</span>

So I conclude with a question that I will leave hanging in the air: when will this government govern for the long-term benefit of all communities that rely on the Murrayânot just the ones in their National Party seats, not just the ones in the eastern states, but actually the whole river and the most vulnerable part of the river? I call on every South Australian MP in this placeâand particularly the member for Barker, who has a large section of the river, and the members for Sturt and Boothbyâto vote for your state and what your state needs and not for your party. Every single South Australian will be watching how you vote today. Vote for the science, not for the politics.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there was some very clever speaking just now by the member for Watson. I think what you could have said, Member for Watson, is that you are walking away from your bipartisan approach, because the two things that you have said you are changing were subject to passage through this parliament. You agreed to them. They went through this parliament in 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The letter I have here was written to me by the then Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. Many members of this House have changed, but I've been here for this journey all along. I know the history. I've lived and breathed it and my communities have hurt more than any other group of communities in the country when it comes to water policy. This letter from Tony Abbott clearly said: 'We will implement the triple bottom line'âwe've always said that; we've maintained it all the way throughâ'of the cap on buy-backs of 1,500 gigalitres, the 450 gigs and the socioeconomic test.' The member for Flinders as environment minister then spoke about it in the House in the debate on the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012. It was agreed to by Labor. It went through the parliament and actually changed the socioeconomic test. That was the only reason that we agreed to it. They were the conditions that we signed up to it, because we knew how much it would hurt farmers. We knew it was a piece of politicking by South Australia to add the 450 gigs. It's physically impossible to deliver. Everyone on the southern basin actually understands that. But we agreed to it with these careful tests. They were secured and confirmed by the minister and the ministerial council in December last year at MinCo. So everyone, all the basin states, were on board with this. Only last week, as we lead into the pre-election period, did Labor change their mind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I come back to the plan itself and the awful reality that my constituents now face if there's a change of government. For them, it will go back to what we all call the bad old days of buyback. That's because the buyback was completely nonstrategic. It was completely haphazard. It divided communities, it divided irrigators and, as the minister said, it divided the country. What Labor have told us they will do is go back to buyback and scrub the neutrality test on the 450 gigs. That is absolutely, totally unacceptable. I really want to appeal to the crossbench. Obviously we're locking in behind our teams here on this message from the Senate, but it's the crossbench that holds the key to this. I appeal to my colleague the member for Indi, because she knows what damage this has done and she knows how much these communities have been hurt. She's very familiar with them. She's a person who cares about farming. I understand the member for Mayo has seconded this bill and I understand the member for Melbourne will lock in behind the Greens but, for the rest of us, if this 450 gigalitres is undone in the way it's recovered, the water will come from my electorate and the member for Murray's electorate. For us to confront our communities that are on their knees right now and actually say to them that we have an opposition in Canberra, potentially the government, that will come back into our communities to recover upwards of 200 gigalitres, if you combine our two electorates, and buy that back we may as well lock the door, turn out the lights and forget about the future. We have almost turned the food bowl of Australia into a dust bowl as it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the member for Watson to talk about how this is good for communities and how this will work for communities is absolute nonsense. Walk down the main street of Finley. Look at the number of shops that have closed. Go to the high school. Talk to the kids. Listen to the stories. Understand that farmers are watching what is notionally a healthy river run straight past their doorstep, taking the water past their region. Their allocation is zero. That's rightâzero. We have to accept that the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder know exactly what they're doing with all this environmental water. Not one drop was able to be borrowed by irrigators through a sensible proposal I put forward last year to allow them to finish growing their winter crops and grow food to feed the rest of the country that was struggling with drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These rivers are flooding. It is physically impossible to deliver this water down to the bottom end of the basin. But people all over Australia think they're experts on this subject. Lots of people come in here who have no idea of the reality of life. They have no idea how we have effectively said to some of the best, youngest, smartest, most innovative and efficient farmers in the country, 'Actually, don't worry about your future in farming because it won't exist under a Labor government.' It won't exist if you, the opposition, become the government in Canberra, because turning your back on the Basin Plan at five minutes to midnightâjust before an electionâis absolutely pure politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the minister said, this is not easy. I am just hanging in there. At one stage I said to the New South Wales minister, 'I think it might be time to exit the Basin Plan.' That was before we secured the northern basin disallowance agreement and we sorted that problem out. Before then, the states were the gatekeepers. What's Labor saying? They're creating enemies of the states in their conversation in the House today. They're saying, 'The states won't do the right thing.' The states are doing the right thing. They're looking after their people. They're standing behind their farmers. At the moment, they are the only thing between this Labor Party and decimation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a piece of public policy that is tolerated at best and hated at worst all across the basin. This is so not just in my patch; it is all across the basin. Surely, that sounds an alarm in this parliament that something needs to be done differently. Where are we now? Yes, I accept the plan is a framework. Yes, I'm just hanging in there, along with most of my community. But what I do know is that it needs flexibility. It needs to have the ability to change the rules. It needs a smart assessmentâan examination of water allocations and entitlements that actually proves the viability and the value of irrigated agriculture and our need to have and introduce that flexibility so those communities can say, 'Yes, we're valued by the parliament of Australia. Yes, we're valued by everyone who sits in this place.'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot overstate what I see as the huge risk in the Labor Party in government owning this policy. They're not going to get there; we're going to get there. But people have to think about this very, very carefully and really consider how hard it's going to be for our farming families, their children and their future if this policy passes. This policy crept into the parliament by way of an Independent senator but was seriously backed up by a release put out by Labor last week that they're not really talking about. But don't worry, it has been heard loud and clear across my electorate. It's a release that actually says they will remove the cap on buyback and restore the original socioeconomic definition for delivering the 450 gigalitres to the system. Not only that, they're moving the Murray-Darling Basin Authority compliance functions to the EPA and having an urgent review of climate change impacts on the basin, which, from my point of view and that of my community, is an excuse to get in there and suddenly say the plan's not working, we have to change it, we have to find more water and we have to do these things.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is all this expertise but none of the hard, practical understanding of talking, listening and learning. Anyone anywhere is welcome to come and speak to my people. Understand the situation and think very, very carefully before you take the actions that it looks like you're going to take.</span>

                    </a>  Mr Speaker, I'm seeking for you to clarify; I'm basing this on previous public statements you've made about how you would use the casting vote. The public statements that you have made about how you would use the casting vote said that, for example, for a second reading motion you would always cast with the ayes, because the principle is to allow for further debate, but for a third reading, for example, or for a motion, you would not use the casting vote to make a final decision that the House had not otherwise made. On this occasion, we have a decision of the House as to whether or not we have concurrence with the Senate. We don't have a procedural motion. We have a formal decision of the House. I put to you, Mr Speaker, in terms of what you have previously said on how you would use your casting vote, that this is not a moment where it allows further debate; it is not the ordinary procedural motion that you might otherwise refer to; it is, in fact, a decision of the House. It would be different from precedent and a different use of the casting vote, certainly, to what you had said publicly you would use it for, if the casting vote becomes the reason that the House forms a view on a policy issue.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeContinuation">The SPEAKER:</span>  I'll hear from the Leader of the House. Just before I do, obviously, sometimes, the principles somewhat conflict. I was obviously giving it consideration. On this occasion my understanding is that the minister had moved that the Senate message not be agreed to. We've dealt with the amendment. I'll hear from the Leader of the House. I think the Manager of Opposition Business has made a point worth considering.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr Pyne:</span>
                    </a>  On the points that have been made by the Manager of Opposition Business and by you Mr Speaker, the position you've previously taken publicly and in this building was that you wouldn't use your casting vote on precedent to change anything. The difficulty with using your casting vote to vote no on this occasion would be that we would actually change something, because the message from the Senate would then become a government decision, or a policy of the House of Representatives. You'd be using your casting vote to make an action occur, and you've said previously that you wouldn't do soâthat you would leave things as they are. The only way to leave things as they are is to cast your vote with the ayes. Otherwise, you would be accepting a message from the Senate, which would be an actionâa changing motion. Therefore, I agree with your decision to vote with the ayes and to use your casting vote with the ayes.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  I think, Manager of Opposition Business, I'm reconsidering. There are three propositions. I don't think we need to go through them all. The final question was that the message from the Senate not be agreed to. There are a number of propositions there. One is to allow debate to continue, that's true. Having reflected on it and having listened to the Manager of Opposition Business, I do think that, on reflection, I should cast my vote with the noes, because I shouldn't vote to create a majority on an issue when a majority doesn't exist. I will cast my vote that way, having reflected on it. Where that leaves us is that the minister's motion has not been agreed to. I'll cast my vote with the noes. I think that is consistent with what I've done in the past, although I hope I have the forbearance of members, given the nature of the motion and the amendment, that my initial reaction was to cast it with the ayes, but I think that is rightâI think I should cast it with the noesâand at this late hour I don't want to be being inconsistent. I really don't. That's my position.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the words of Mr Hughes, who, from our first hearing in Sydney, set the tone of this inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 19 September 2018, the Treasurer, the Hon. Josh Frydenberg, referred to the committee an inquiry into the removal of refundable franking credits. The Treasurer asked the committee to inquire into and report on the implications of removing refundable franking credits and, in particular, the stress and complexity it will cause Australians, including older Australians who will be impacted in their retirement. I'm proud that, despite the noise around this inquiry at every point and the attempts by many people to shut it down, the focus of this inquiry has remained where it belongs: to give voice to the people who are affected by this policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the calls by the shadow Treasurer in January of this year that this inquiry was an abuse, this is clearly not the view of many Australians. The public response to this inquiry was extraordinary. The committee held a series of 19 public hearings across the continent to allow Australians to have a say in light of a policy proposed to be introduced on 1 July 2019. These hearings were incredibly well attended. At many other public hearings we might be lucky to have a handful of members of the public. At these hearings the number often exceeded 300 people and was sometimes nearly 500. A total of 1,770 submissions were published and many more documents were received, and we simply ran out of time and the resources to be able to process them all for publication. I want to thank every single person who contributed to this inquiry for their courage. It takes a lot of courage to go on the public record and tell your private story about your own private circumstances and your own private financial affairs. But the reality is the people who did had to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the participation in the inquiry was high, worryingly, the evidence suggests that many people at risk of being impacted from a policy change are unaware of the proposal that could result in them losing a third of their income. The risk is particularly concerning when many retirees in Australia live outside of capital cities and are at a vulnerable stage of their lifeâpeople like Ms Paull, who, at the Upper Coomera hearings, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">My husband and I are both in our 70s and we're self-funded retirees. I belong to that era when females had to resign from the workplace when they married.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember asking, as the chair: 'Does that mean that you earn less than the tax-free threshold of $18,200?' The answer was yes. She continued:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My husband is 78 years old and is in remission from cancer, and has recently developed heart issues. So those out-of-pocket health expenses are now running in the thousands. If we lose a third of my income, which will be approximately $6,000 a year, under Labor's proposal to deny cash rebates for franking credits to low-income and retired shareholdersâwhich I amâwe'll have to seriously consider giving up hospital health insurance â¦</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the public discussions surround the abolition of refundable franking credits have focused primarily on retirees, the committee heard evidence of others who need certainty in their lives and are at risk. These include mothers who have taken a break from employment to have children, those earning below the tax-free threshold and people with a disability with ageing parents who have income from shares to maintain independent living.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes people spoke for those who couldn't. In Chatswood, Ms Truelove represented her mother and said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I'm just going to talk about my mother. I have a mother who is 101 years old. She still lives independently, and one of the reasons why is she can't afford to do otherwise. My mother was brought up on a farm; we have a family farm that was in my father's family. They first settled there in about 1870. My brother has been running the farm. Unfortunately, through drought, a fire that burnt 90 per cent of the farm and some mismanagement, there was a huge debt of $1.3 million on the farm. It was in my brother's name, which meant that the land got sold and the debt was paid. But the debt still stands in my brother's name as an asset to my mother, so she cannot get the pension. She is very talented in terms of what she does with her money. She learnt to invest in shares. Up until a few years ago, she bought and sold a few shares, and she has lived on around $120,000 worth of assets that she's bought and sold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Her income last year was $6,600. Her franking credits were $1,900âI did her tax for her. That is about to be taken away, should the Labor Party get into power. That money pays for her private health fund. She rents an apartment that costs her $100 a week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's simply despicable that such a fiercely proud family would be pushed down the financial stairs by this policy. They are attacking Australians' sacrifice, they are attacking their security and they are attacking their dignity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's against this evidence that the committee has completed the inquiry. The committee has considered the case for removing refundable franking credits and is of the view that the policy is inequitable and deeply flawed. Franking credits play an important role in Australia's tax dividend imputation system. Franking credits are attached to an imputed tax to the individual, to stop double taxation. They are stated on an individual's tax assessment notice as withheld tax and are used to assess an individual's taxable income at the end of the financial year and for access to other benefits, such as healthcare cards. Franking credits are only received when tax is paid, and their abolition for refundability while still being considered as part of a taxable income is poor tax policy and discriminates between taxpayers.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who have made their voice heard put worrying stories to the inquiry, and I've already read some. Many affected retirees spoke of anxiety from the fear of losing a third of their income. There is Karen's story of exhausting and soul-destroying stress, and we heard regularly about people for whom the simple existence of breaking apart the bipartisan consensus is causing anxiety and stress. Others raised concerns that abolishing refundable franking credits would compound the legacy of the gender pay gap. There was Margaret's story of historic sexism and how too many people making decisions for us are totally unaware of our history and our lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there were the straight stories of financial hardship. There was Michael's story of medical challenges and how the removal of refundable franking credits would cause him considerable hardship. In particular, abolishing refundable franking credits would unfairly hit people of modest incomes who have already retired and who are unlikely to be able to return to the workforce to make up the income they will lose. In her submission, Barbara from South Australia said: 'I have been a Labor voter most of my life; however, I could not vote for a Labor Party proposing these changes. Almost 10 years ago I took time off work for the South Australian government and an accident almost killed me, causing paralysis. I never worked again, and after a successful public liability lawsuit I received a settlement. If my funds were invested well, the majority of my disability expenses were covered. However, the proposed changes by the Labor Party jeopardise my ability to do this.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The abolition of refundable franking credits will force many people who have saved throughout their whole lives to be independent onto the age pension. Of course, this undermines any stated objective that it may raise revenue and reduce the dependence on taxpayers resulting from an ageing population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some have argued that the intention to scrap refundable franking credits is designed to tax the wealthy. This, of course, is a deeply unfair characterisation of the 900,000-odd Australians who are going to be affected by losing up to a third of their income. It also does not take into account the introduction of the transfer balance cap in the 2017-18 financial year, which of course means there will now be, ridiculously, an effective 30 per cent tax rate for many Australian retirees unless they're uber richâthen, they get a 15 per cent tax rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Abolition of refundable franking credits is fundamentally regressive. Australia has a tax-free threshold of $18,200 for workers, and yet its abolition of refundable franking credits would apply an effective 30 per cent tax rate from the first dollar earned. The fact-free dehumanisation of franking credit recipients has made it easy to dismiss the concerns of those impacted. The Alliance for a Fairer Retirement System claims that in 2014-15 over half of those receiving cash refunds for their franking credits had incomes below the $18,201 tax-free threshold, and 96 per cent had taxable incomes of less than $87,000. These Australians are hardly high-income earners and yet they stand to lose up to a third of their income overnight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Such a policy discriminates against retirees and self-managed super funds in favour of members of APRA regulated industry and retail superannuation funds and those eligible to receive a part or full age pension before 28 March 2018. Labor have protected their union mates at the expense of those people who have done the right thing. We know this because the shadow Treasurer himself said to those who complained and raised concerns, 'Go and vote for someone else.' This policy may also reduce the value of some Australian shares and reduce investment in Australian companies. A range of submitters were concerned about the need to rearrange their investments and to reduce spending, particularly on private health insurance and charitable donations. The committee is concerned that these serious policy implications have not been addressed in any proposal that is sought to be implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In consideration of the evidence received during this inquiry, the committee strongly recommends against the removal of refundable franking credits. Any policy that could reduce Australian retirees' incomes by up to a third should be considered as part of an equitable package for comprehensive tax reform. A government that seeks to steal the overpaid tax of Australians does not deserve office. A parliamentarian that looks at citizens and their overpaid tax as ATMs does not have a right in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to conclude by thanking the secretariat. This inquiry has been extensive. We have held a number of hearings, and it has at times been quite difficult to manage. There have been many attempts to shut it down. The burden has fallen on the secretariat to act impartially and with cool heads, and they have done so. Despite the nefarious attempts, the secretariat staff have ensured the legitimacy of this report has stayed intact, because it simply gives voice to the Australian people impacted by the proposals considered. My particular thanks go to Stephen Boyd and John White, who spent a lot of time travelling around the country with us. This inquiry was not easy, because we had to channel the rage of thousands of Australians who simply wanted a voice about the impacts on them of losing a third of their income on 1 July if there is a policy change. I am proud to say we have given them that voice. With sorrow, I table the report.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>):  by leaveâThis inquiry has been a farce from the outset. The usual role of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics is to scrutinise government legislation and to hear the views of the Australian public and offer amendments to the House of Representatives. But, because this government is devoid of any economic policies or economic plan of its own, it decided to look into an opposition policy. That's fine, but the manner in which the government, the Treasurer and the coalition members of this committee have run this inquiry is an unprecedented abuse of parliamentary process and committee processes and undermines the standing of the economics committee in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The procedure that the chair established when this inquiry started was for his own website to be set up to take submissions. His website had an official look; it had a coat of arms and it said that it was authorised by the Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics. But then it had articles on that website attacking the Labor Party, our policy and Kerryn Phelps. If you put a submission in to the House of Representatives economics committee through that website, it was a pre-filled-out submission. All you had to do was add your name, and that was a submission to the House of Representatives Economics Committee. This means that roughly a thousand of the submissions to this inquiry were written by the chair, the member for Goldstein. They weren't written by members of the Australian public; they were written by the chair! And then, as a condition of submitting your views to the inquiry, you were asked to tick a box to say that you would sign a Liberal Party petition against Labor's policyâan unprecedented abuse of parliamentary process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we found out that the website was partially funded by Wilson Asset Management, a company that has a vested interest in ensuring that Labor's policy does not get up. We then found out that Geoff Wilson, the principal of Wilson Asset Management, colluded with the chair about establishing the inquiry and the dates and venues at which it occurred to make sure that they could get some of their investors, who had a vested interest in seeing this policy go down, to turn up to the hearings. And the hearings just happened to coincide with investor meetings of Wilson Asset Management. Then, after the first hearing of this inquiry and after Wilson Asset Management had appeared before the committee, we found out that the member for Goldstein, the chair of the inquiry, has shares in Wilson Asset Management. The member for Goldstein, the chair of this inquiry, has a vested interest, a financial interest, in seeing this policy go down.</span>

When we went to the hearings, there were Liberal Party election posters at the front of the venues. When we were in Queensland, the member for Fisher gave evidence to the committee and then encouraged members of the crowd to sign up to the Liberal-National Party. After the members of the crowd had all stopped laughing, he went around the room handing out Liberal Party membership forms. Mr Deputy Speaker, I might remind you that this was an official hearing of the House of Representatives economics committee.</span>

                    </a>  Because of the behaviour of LNP members, naturally many members of the public were outraged. They were outraged at the conduct of the government members on the House of Representatives economics committee and the abuse of taxpayers' dollars. So many members of the public wrote to the committee. They sent emails and letters expressing their disgust at the procedure of the House of Representatives economics committee. Two of them were former members of the House of Representatives. We had a meeting of the House of Representatives economics committee a month ago and I moved a motion that, in the interests of transparency and accountability, the letters from members of the public be published, that the letters be put on the website of the committee. The committee voted, and the committee voted for all. Obviously, Labor and Greens members voted in support of publishing the letters and the coalition members voted against it. The chair used his casting vote to deny publication of those letters. So much for freedom, boys; so much for transparency and accountability. The chair, in one of the hearings, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's policy is fiscally responsible. It's an approach to ensuring that you are closing tax loopholes that overwhelmingly benefit the well-off in this country so we deal with the structural challenges that the budget is facingânamely, the ageing of the population.

                    </a>  We've had a Medicare rebate freeze for the last six years. We've had cuts to hospitals and cuts to school funding. If we're going to ensure that the budget is sustainable and that we can fund those services into the future, we need to make responsible savings. That's what Labor's policy does. When this policy was introduced by the Howard government, it cost the budget $500 million. It now costs $5.8 billion. It's more than we spend on Australian public schools, it is unsustainable, and we're giving tax handouts to people who don't pay tax in this country. Labor is saying that, if we're elected, we will end that policy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PBO analysis of our policy is quite illuminating because it looks at who receives cash refunds for dividend imputation in this country. Fifty per cent of all excess imputation credits refunded to SMSFs accrued to the wealthiest 10 per cent of SMSFs, by fund balance, which had in excess of $2.4 million in the balance of the fund. Eighty-two per cent of those funds had balances of more than $1.04 million. These are not people who are struggling. That is why Labor is doing thisâbecause the claims that this policy targets the poor are not suggested and not supported by the facts. And, of course, Labor guarantee that pensioners won't be affected by this particular policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This policy of refunding franking credits also promotes risk and inhibits investment in Australian companies. We all know that it distorts investment decisions. We heard from many who said that they were advised by their accountant or their financial adviser not to look for where the best companies were investing, their research and innovation, their development proposals or their growth into the future but just to look for the companies that have fully franked dividends and will return a guaranteed income funded by the Australian taxpayer. It inhibits growth in the stock exchange, and it's one of the reasons why many start-up businesses in Australia have to go overseas to try and find capital. They can't get it here in Australia because we have a lazy investment market on the back of this policy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people who gave evidence at this inquiry said that they only invested in the banks and Telstra because of the fully franked dividends that they received at the end of every year. If you're in the retirement phase of your lifestyle, being fully invested in five or six different companies is not a wise investment strategy. It's certainly not encouraging diversification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other myth that was propelled by the government around this is that it is a tax. It's simply not a tax at all. We're asking people who don't pay any income tax in a particular year to refund those franking credit refunds that they've been receiving. It's not retrospective. It was announced last year to give people the opportunity to digest the policy and, importantly, to get financial advice from their accountants or their financial advisers. It is not a withholding tax. It's a good policy, and Labor backs it to the hilt.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00ATG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  Women and men of Australia, a budget should sketch the big picture, build for the long term, write Australia large, be ambitious, be as bold as the Australian people. That's what a Labor government will do: strive for the best, because Australians deserve the best. But instead, on Tuesday night, we received an exercise in numerology, a recitation of numbersâno passion, no national story, no vision laid out to divine where the country is and where the country is going and no reform. They were the same promises made and broken six years running. Yes, there is a third Prime Minister and a third Treasurer but, where it mattered, the same Liberal budgetâthe same void where an energy policy should be, the same failure on stagnant wages and rising cost of living, the same denial on climate change, the same $14 billion cut to schools and the same $2.8 billion cut to hospitals. So tonight the first commitment I can give Australians, and one of the most important, is: if we win the next election, we will put back every single dollar that the Liberals have cut from public schools and public hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be fair, there was one new feature in this budget, albeit troubling: the short-changing of the National Disability Insurance Scheme by $1.6 billion to prop up a flimsy budget surplus forecast. Now, it looks a lot more like dodgy accounting than good economic management. I freely acknowledge that government members sincerely care about people with disability, but the truth is in the record of the last six years. The government has made a record of poor decisions regarding the NDISâsacking the board; delaying the signing of funding agreements with the states; capping staff numbers for the National Disability Insurance Agency, leading to an outbreak of contractors and consultants undermining the system. And then, after all these policies that hamstring delivery of services, the government shrugs and says, 'The $1.6 billion wasn't needed, because of a lack of demand.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are thousands of Australians who've embraced the promise of the NDIS but whose legitimate demands have simply not been met. There is the young man in Ballarat who waited for more than two years for a wheelchairâwaited so long that he ended up in hospital with pressure sores. There is the family whose daughter has an intellectual disability who waited 10 months for the funding for the speech therapy she needed to learn to make friends at school. Or there is the family of a profoundly deaf young man who was denied interpreters and training in Auslan who have spent the last 2Â½ years appealing the decision. All these peopleâthe carers seeking modest respite; the parents and the loved ones filling out the forms, calling time and time again for promises not fulfilled, waiting on the phonesâthey do not tell me that there is a lack of demand. They're talking about a desperate need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Working with Jenny Macklin, working with people with disability, their carers and an army of advocates to help create the National Disability Insurance Scheme, is one of the most rewarding things that I've ever been part of. Tonight, I can give every Australian living with a disability, and the people who love them, this personal commitment: if we are elected as the next government of Australia we will lift the NDIA cap on staff numbers so that we can get the support out the door and keep the promises made to people with disabilities. We will put people with disability at the centre of decision-making in the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We will get the NDIS back on track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that our opponents have finally seen the light on supporting the bigger, better and fairer tax cuts for 10 million Australians that I put forward at my last budget reply speech. Tonight, I can confirm that, from 1 July, if you earn between $48,000 and $126,000, no matter who you vote for in May you will get the same tax refund. But the Liberal tax plan does not do enough for 2.9 million Australians who will earn less than $40,000. About 57 per cent of these are womenâchildcare workers, classroom assistants, hairdressers, office managers, and parents returning to work part time. In a lot of these cases these are the very same workers in retail, hospitals, pharmacy and fast food who've already had their penalty rates arbitrarily cut. Tonight, I am pleased to say that in Chris Bowen's first budget Labor will provide a bigger tax refund than the Liberals for 3.6 million Australiansâall told, an extra $1 billion for low-income earners in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's always a lot of talk about tax from those opposite, but here's the simple truth: 6.4 million working people will pay the same amount of income tax under Labor as under the Liberals and another 3.6 million will pay less tax under Labor. But we will not be signing up to the Liberals' radical, right-wing, flat-tax experiment way off in the future, a scheme that would see a nurse on $50,000 paying the same tax rate as a surgeon on $200,000. We won't back a plan that gives a retail worker on $35,000 less than $5 a week while an investment banker pockets more than $11,000 a year. This is not a tax plan; it's a ticking debt bomb. It is neither fair nor responsible to lock in those billions of dollars in tax giveaways flowing disproportionately to a relatively few Australians, and so far into the future, especially when you consider the foreboding we see in the global environment: Brexit, trade wars, the write-downs in global growth, the massive increase in global debt and the drop in the 10-year bond yields. This is the time when Australia should be building a strong surplus, a fiscal buffer. The Liberals talk so much about being back in the black, but the budget papers reveal a much paler shade of grey. What we need is a fighting fund for the nationâa strong surplus to protect us from international shocks. Surpluses can only be built on real reform, not by cutting schools and hospitals, not by short-changing the NDIS and not by banking on the price of ore and a blue-sky environment. Tonight, I recommit that that is what Labor will take to the next electionâstronger surpluses paying down national debt faster, guaranteeing everything from our commitment to defence spending at two per cent of GDP to drought relief for farmers and keeping our borders secure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nearly six years ago my united team and I made a choice. We decided not to be the kind of opposition who just stay quiet, cross our fingers and hope that the government tears itself apart. We decided to lead the reform debate with a bold agenda. We believe the Australian people are hungry for a united, stable government with a real vision for the futureâone that can make hard decisions. We believe that government has a responsibility to leave the place better than when we found it. That is why we are going to stop the intergenerational unfairness in our tax system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're currently negatively gearing, the rules won't change. If you want to use it on new homes, you still can. But you cannot have property investors playing with loaded dice against our young people, generation Y and the millennials. Instead of patronising millions of young Australians with lectures about cutting back on smashed avo, why don't we tell them the truth? Getting together a 20 per cent deposit plus stamp duty is much, much harder than it was 20 or 25 years ago. And it is even more difficult when your government uses your taxpayer money to subsidise the property investors bidding against you. The intergenerational bias that the tax system has against young people must be called out. A government must be brave enough and decent enough to stop the bias against first home buyers and young Australiansâand we will be that government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the same goes for dividend imputation. If the tax office pays a tax credit to someone who pays no tax, this is a gift. It is a gift that is costing taxpayers nearly $6 billion every year and it is growing so fast it will soon be more than what we spend on our public schools. It's not illegal, it's not immoral, but it's just not sustainable anymore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reform which delivers intergenerational fairness to our young must include real action on climate change. The climate change debate has poisoned this parliament for 10 yearsâand it's most certainly paralysed the current government. So tonight let's deal in simple facts. Climate change is real. It is doing real damage to our economy and to our environment. And we can measure the cost of inactionâbushfires, droughts, floods, extreme weather and damage to our farmland and our reef. For the sake of the Australia that we hand on to our children, a Labor government will not shirk the task of reform; it will take real action on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, and at this election, Labor is offering the Australian people a fully-funded, fair-go action plan: building an economy that works for everyone; investing in an education system that creates opportunity for everyone; fixing the wages system so it delivers for everyone; reforming the tax system so it is fair for everyone; and funding a health system that is there for everyone. We believe that Australia does best when working-class and middle-class Australia gets a fair go, when the economy is managed in the interests of everyone, when the people who create our national wealth get their fair share of the national wealth and when everyone has an equal chance to fulfil their personal potential. This is why investing in the future always begins with education. And this is where the difference between Labor and the government could not be more stark. Nine out of 10 new jobs created in the next four years will require either a university degree or a TAFE qualification, and only a Labor government will be prepared to properly fund both. We'll uncap university places, opening the doors of higher education to an additional 200,000 Australians. And, when it comes to vocational education, Labor is backing public TAFE all the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been fortunate to visit about 30 TAFEs around Australia since the last election. The teachers and students are inspirational. So tonight I'm pleased to announce that we're going to double the size of our rebuilding TAFE fundâup to $200 million to renovate campuses in regional and outer suburban Australia. This will mean new training facilities for training nurses in Caboolture and Devonport, new workshops in Midland and Bellevue to make sure the METRONET train carriages work goes to apprentices, new construction centres for tradies in Chadstone and Frankston and so much more. Labor will also pay the up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE places to get more Australians training in high-priority courses. Tonight, I am proud to announce that 20,000 of these places will be allocated to a new generation of aged-care workers and paid carers for the National Disability Insurance Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My mother was a great teacher. She taught me that you can measure a nation's values by how much it values education. I want every child in Australia to get the one-on-one attention that they need to thrive. I want Aboriginal kids to get genuine equal opportunity and children with disability or learning difficulties to get the support they need. I want every child participating in sport, trying drama, learning music, going on camps and getting access to new technologyâand not as optional extras to which parents pay increasing levies, not as luxuries that rely on the teachers raising the money themselves. I want it guaranteedâguaranteed because every school in Australia should offer every child the same world of opportunity. There is one more thing that we'll do to make Australian schools the best in the world: we'll make Tanya Plibersek the minister for education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Experts tell us that 90 per cent of a child's brain develops before the age of five. Two years of preschool or kindergarten is the rule in countries at the top of the global education ladder: South Korea, Norway, New Zealand, France and the United Kingdom. Last year, China enrolled 46 million three-year-olds in preschool programs. But Australia's falling behind in the early-years education, and that affects our children right through their educational lives. If you vote Labor, we will guarantee universal access to preschool or kinder for every three-year-old and every four-year-old in Australiaâ15 hours a week, 40 weeks a year. Two years of preschool is global best practice, and it's only just good enough for our kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our vision for education and training is all about putting Australia on the high road to the futureâhigh-skilled workers, highest-quality products, high-value services and higher-wage jobs. It means backing local businesses and industries. We backed a tax cut for small and medium businesses and we will provide an extra 20 per cent tax break for every business that invests in productivity-boosting equipment above $20,000, whether that's a big manufacturer buying new technology or a tradie getting a new ute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will invest in industries where Australia can be the best in the world. I speak of agricultural, tourism, hydrogen energy, science and research, advanced manufacturing, mineral exploration to unearth new wealth, the defence industry and commercial shipbuilding to revive our merchant marine and see more Australian ships flying the Australian ensign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Embracing renewables will also create thousands upon thousands of new jobs for Australia. Labor will provide a $2,000 payment to families who want to join the fight against climate change and the fight to lower their power bills by installing a battery storage system. Here's the remarkable thing: we already have every single resource to make a lithium battery right here in Australia. So, instead of the usual trope of shipping the minerals overseas and buying back the finished product at vastly inflated prices, let's make the batteries here. And let's do this with electric vehicles, charging equipment and stations too, supported by Australia's first electric vehicle policy. Rather than relying on China and India to accept our plastic and waste or to leave it choking our waterways and killing our marine life, let's recycle it here at home. When it comes to clean technology, I believe we can make three words famous right around the worldâ'made in Australia'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Building an economy that works for everyone means a massive building program right across our nation. We will reinvigorate jobs in the construction sector with our build-to-rent plan, targeting negative gearing to new housing, renovating the national energy grid with new pipelines, interconnectors, hydro and storage and launching the biggest affordable housing program since the Second World War, building a quarter of a million new homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will invest in safe accommodation for women fleeing violent relationships because too often, when the worst happens, people still ask, 'Why didn't she leave?' What we should ask is, 'Where would she go?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have transport plans and projects ready to go in every state and territoryâthe Cross River Rail in Brisbane, the Western Sydney metro, the Suburban Rail Loop in Melbourne, the Bridgewater Bridge in Tassie, South Road in South Australia, METRONET in Perth, upgrading the roads around Kakadu and phase 2 of the ACT light rail. Thanks to Albo's hard work, the work is just beginning. Labor will continue to develop and support the development of northern Australia, including overdue upgrades for the beef roads and the Rocky ring road. Tonight, I can announce we will deliver $1.5 billion to upgrade the Gateway Motorway from Bracken Ridge to the Pine River and the next stage of the Bruce Highway from the northern suburbs to Caboolture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another big difference between Liberal and Labor on infrastructure. In their budget, you have to vote for the current Prime Minister at this election and then you have to vote for whoever is their leader at the next electionâand that's before anyone even digs a hole. Our projects are not on the never-never. They're locked into our first budget. But there's another difference that I offer the Australian people, frustrated by the constant short-termism in the infrastructure debateâif we are elected, I will invite the then opposition leader to be involved in nominating directors to Infrastructure Australia so we take the politics out and we make generational decisions in infrastructure for once and for all time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time we invest Commonwealth dollars in infrastructure projects, we'll make the rule that one in 10 people employed must be an Australian apprentice. The sad news of the last six years is that, under the current government, apprenticeship numbers have fallen by 150,000. The good news is that, because of our vision in infrastructure, housing construction, the NDIS, TAFE and training, health and hospitals, early childhood education, energy and the digital economy, a Labor government can repair the damage done. Tonight I say we will help train 150,000 apprentices for the jobs of the future and we'll provide additional support for the businesses who take them on, both young people and mature-age workers looking to retrain and to learn new skills. And we will also create an apprentice advocate, because the tragic death of an 18-year-old apprentice on the Macquarie Park site last week reminds us that we've got to protect our apprentices and make sure they come home safe, just like everybody else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next election will be a referendum on wages. We need to get wages growth going again for workers, for the economy, for confidence and consumption, because when we boost the spending power of working people the money flows back into the tills of small business. In the last six years, three Liberal prime ministers and three Liberal treasurers have signed off on official forecasts for wages growth. They've been wrong 27 times in a row. Twenty-seven times they have promised and not delivered. On Tuesday night, to be fair, the Treasurer boldly said that he would 'like' wages growth to be high. He would like that. But, after six years of wages stagnation, liking and wishing and hoping is not a plan for working people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last six years we've tried it their way, the government's way: the invisible hand; 'Leave it to the market.' We now know how that all ends. Since the last election, wages have risen by around five per cent, whilst company profits have increased nearly 40 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only Labor have a concrete, practical plan to get wages moving again: (1) if we win the election, we'll legislate to restore the arbitrary cuts to Sunday and public penalty rates in our first 100 days; (2) we will stop companies using sham contracts and dodgy labour-hire arrangements to cut people's pay; and (3) our tradie pay guarantee means that subbies working on Commonwealth projects get paid on time every time. And we will help the 1.2 million lowest-paid Australians by creating a living wage. Of course we will consult with employers and the independent umpire, and of course we will take into account the capacity of business and the economy to sustain the wages growth. But I don't want any Australian adult who works full-time to be trapped in poverty. A sensible, overdue plan to achieve moderate but meaningful improvement in wages is what we offer Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And whenever we talk about fair pay it includes equal pay and fairer conditions for the women of Australia; a new push for better pay for women and in women-dominated industries like early education; new measures to help boost the superannuation of working women; and 10 days of paid leave for people dealing with family violence. This is what you get from a political party that walks the walk on equality for women and has so many talented women in our ranks in parliament right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this election we're offering a genuine alternative for regional Australia: better support for our dairy farmers to get a fair deal; working to restore the Murray-Darling to health; helping restock the cattle herd of North Queensland; new investments in eliminating mobile blackspots; and a more reliable NBN for small business. And not only will we put back the $83 million the Liberals cut from the ABC; we'll provide another $10 million to support regional news and emergency broadcasting, especially in areas affected by natural disasters, such as Townsville, Tasmania and regional Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can also give regional communities this simple, important pledge: no more privatising and outsourcing human services in the bush. If you are a pensioner or a veteran living in the regions, you shouldn't be stuck on hold for hours waiting for help; you should be able to speak to a human being face to face. You deserve no less.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And to my fellow Australians tonight, I want to conclude by talking to you directly in your lounge rooms about our vision for the most significant investment in Medicare in a generation. Cancer is one of the biggest killers in our nation. Not for nothing is it called the emperor of all maladies. One in two of us will be diagnosed with cancer at some stage in our life. One hundred and forty-five thousand of our fellow Australians are diagnosed with cancer each year and 50,000 die. One way or another, we will all witness the ordeal. I saw it with my mum and her battle with breast cancer. Chloe and I have seen it with dear friends of oursâsome old, some far too young.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cancer is frightening. It's isolating. It's exhausting. And all too often, though, it's impoverishing. For so many people, cancer makes you sick and then paying for the treatment makes you poor. I think a lot of Australians would be surprised to learn that all these vital scans and tests and consultations with specialists are not fully covered by Medicare. Instead, they cost hundreds of dollars, adding up to thousands out of your own pocket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has the highest rates of skin cancer in the world, and most people pay over $5,000 for the first two years of their treatment. One in four women diagnosed with breast cancer pay over $10,000 for two years of scans and tests. Some men with prostate cancer are paying more than $18,000. And if you're in stage 4 cancer you have to quit work, so your finances are already under horrendous strain. If you live in the regions, there are the added costs of travel and accommodation. Every year, 300,000 Australians who need radiology just don't get it because they can't afford it. That's 300,000 of us. We're a smart country. We've got the best healthcare staff. We are a rich country. We're a generous country, and we are better than the statistics I read out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If someone you love has cancer, you'd sell the roof over your head. If it would help, you'd sell the shirt off your back. But should you have to? Our fellow Australians pay their taxes to Canberra. You pay your Medicare levy. If I'm elected Prime Minister, I'm going to make sure that the healthcare system is there for you when you need it most. So tonight I'm announcing the most important investment in Medicare since Bob Hawke created it: Labor's $2.3 billion Medicare cancer plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my fellow Australians, I'll explain what that would be used for. First, if we win the election, we will invest $600 million towards eliminating all of the out-of-pocket costs for diagnostic imaging. Over four years this will mean six million free cancer scans funded by MedicareâCT scans, PET scans, mammograms, X-rays and ultrasoundsâreducing the out-of-pocket costs for cancer patients from hundreds of dollars to zero, and this will apply to MRIs too. Today only half of the MRI machinesâthat amazing technologyâin Australia are covered by Medicare. People in the bush and the regions often have to drive hours or pay thousands. If we win this election, not only will we provide new MRI machines to communities where they are needed most; we're going to change the game. We will guarantee that every single MRI machine which meets national standards is covered by Medicare for cancer scans, full stop. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of our plan is to deal with the cost of seeing a specialist. As anyone knows, treating cancer relies on a marvellous team of experts: medical oncologists in charge of your diagnosis and ongoing chemotherapy and immunotherapy, surgeons performing your operations and monitoring your recovery, radiation oncologists designing targeted radiation therapy plans to destroy cancer cells. These appointments are part of your weekly routine, often for years. There are the trips, the waiting, the treatment, the recoveryâthousands of dollars. A new Labor government will invest $433 million to immediately cover specialist consultations for cancer patients. What this means over the next four years is that an additional three million appointments will be bulk-billed with no out-of-pocket costs, reducing what you pay from hundreds of dollars to zero.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third part of our plan is our affordable medicine guarantee. Every drug recommended by the independent experts will be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemeânot just cutting the cost of your treatment; cutting the cost of your cancer medication too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cancer is a curse. I wish I could stand here tonight and guarantee that we'll find a cure for each cancer. No politician can give that promise. We will continue to support our scientists in their work. We'll invest in the research and the clinical trials. Until the day that we find a cure, I promise the men and women of Australia this: under Labor, if you're battling cancer, you focus on getting well without worrying about going broke. I can promise you that, if you're in the fight of your life, a Labor government will be alongside you every step of the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To summarise what our first four years of Labor's Medicare Cancer Plan means for Australians: up to six million free cancer scans, three million free appointments with specialists and an affordable medicine guarantee. This is our vision for the future. This is our vision to build Medicare. We can pay for it and we can deliver it because of our reform decisions. We choose our healthcare system over bigger tax loopholes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in conclusion, my fellow Australians, I suspect that some in the government will spend a lot of time telling you to be afraidâafraid of change, afraid of new ideas, afraid of the future, afraid of each other. I expect we'll see more of that in the campaign ahead. I have a different view. I'm optimistic about our nation's future because this country has so much going for us: a continent to call our own, next to the fastest-growing economies in the world and the resources to be an energy superpower. We have the skills, the science and the get-up-and-go to create new industries. Best of all, we have our people. Australians are hardworking, caring, brave, smart and generous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll never be the biggest country in the world. We'll never seek to impose our ideology on other nations. But I do believe that, if we're not the biggest, we should still aim to be the bestâthe best in education and skills; the best in health and aged care and looking after people with dementia; and the best in fair wages and fair reward for your work. That is the real choice that our country faces at this election. It is the decision which every Australian has the right to make. Do we want the best healthcare system in the world or the biggest tax loopholes? Do we want our children to get the world's best education or the world's most generous tax subsidies? Do we want a fairer, more equal country where the economy works in the interests of everyone, or do we want another three years of drift, with the top end of town profiting much better than everybody else?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My team and I have made the reform decisions to put forward the Fair Go Action Plan for Australia so that Australia can be the best that we should be. Labor offers stability, unity and a vision for the nation. We choose hope over fear. We choose the future over the past. We choose the best support possible for people with cancer. We choose fair wages and good jobs. We choose TAFE and apprenticeships. We choose a voice for First Australians enshrined in our Constitution. We choose renewables and we choose real action on climate change. We choose the ABC. We choose equality for the women of Australia; equality for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If these things matter to youâif you believe that, when all is said and done about politics, the most important things are family and health, if you believe in handing on a better deal to your kids than the one you inherited from your parentsâif you believe that's the sort of vision we should have for Australia, then, when you cast your vote in May, choose a Labor government for all Australians.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  The people I represent in Fremantle, East Fremantle and Cockburn know that the most important things are the public goods and services we create and share together: our schools, our parks and coastal reserves and our public health system. That's why I'm so pleased that Labor is committed to providing $5 million for an urgent-care clinic at Fremantle Hospital as part of Labor's $2.8 billion better hospitals fund. It's why I've been so glad to be involved in delivering grants through the stronger community grants program to the Freo Street Doctor, the Fremantle Women's Health Centre and the oral health clinic at St Patrick's Community Support Centre. All these services are vital to providing health care and dental care to people in my community, and especially to those facing disadvantage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The urgent-care clinic, which would be funded by a Labor government if elected, is a much needed investment in local health services. It means that people in the Fremantle area will have access to free out-of-hours health care for serious but not life-threatening illnesses or injuries, the kinds of issues for which many of us would have presented in the past to the ED at Freo hospital, needing care for either ourselves or our kids. With an urgent-care clinic at Freo hospital that service will exist again and not only will provide better, closer and more-accessible health care when accidents or illnesses flare up out of the blue but, in so doing, will also take pressure off the fantastic new ED at Fiona Stanley. For those reasons I'm very glad to make the urgent-care clinic the focus of my campaign in Fremantle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, the people I represent in Fremantle, East Fremantle and Cockburn know that the most important things are the public goods and services we create and share together: our parks, our coastal reserves, our public health system and, of course, our education system and our local schools. The people I represent know that, unfortunately, every level of education, from early childhood through schools to TAFE and university, has been squeezed and neglected by this Liberal government. It means kids are simply not getting the chance to be their best and our schools are not set up to provide teaching resources where they're most needed. It means we're not equipping people for the jobs of the future and we're not unlocking the creativity and innovation that is critical to Australia's future as a whole. That's why Labor has an across-the-board grassroots-to-treetop plan for sustaining high-quality education in this country. We're creating 100,000 fee-free TAFE places, we're abolishing the cap on university places and we're introducing a national preschool and kindy program. In the Fremantle electorate, that means an additional $24 million in funding to schools on the basis of need. Every school in the Fremantle electorate will receive more funding. It means $1.4 million over three years for Lakeland Senior High School, $1.3 million for Fremantle College, Beeliar Primary School would get an extra $620,000 and South Coogee primary school would get $560,000. My community knows that education is the key to opportunity and equality. It's the key to inclusive prosperity and shared wellbeing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOOD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  Today I wish to bring to the attention of the chamber the desperate need for major upgrades of sports facilities in Berwickâin particular for the Berwick football and netball clubsâand also in the Pakenham area. When it comes to the Berwick football and netball clubs, the netballers currently have no change rooms or showers for training or game day. They have two small public toilet cubicles or their cars to get changed into and out of their playing gear, which is totally unacceptable. There is nowhere even to have a shower: the way they dry off is basically to stand around until their clothes are no longer wet, which is an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The great news is that I've worked with the Australian federal government, and we've been able to receive $1.5 million for the Berwick football and netball clubs. I'd really like to thank Peter Hughes for all the great work he has done. Working with me too have been Glenn Gambetta, and Mel Bradley from the netballers. I also want to give special thanks to the Casey council, to the mayor, Amanda Stapledon, and to councillor Susan Serey, as Casey council has matched the funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come now to the Pakenham area, which I have just inherited under the redistribution. I visited the Pakenham Football and Netball Club, and I have been very proud to announce $1.5 million. I'd like to acknowledge Travis Hamilton for the work he has done to secure this funding, as well as Ian Shaw, Tom Dalton and Marg Jones. When I first visited the netball facility, the girls had no toilets and no change rooms. It was an absolute disgrace. That will now change into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to the junior sports over in Pakenham: the Pakenham Junior Football Club, Little Athletics and the cricket and baseball clubs. Again, their facilities are totally unacceptable. Again, there are no female change rooms. They have hundreds of junior players there each week. The great news is the federal government have been able to secure $3 million in funding. This is going to make a huge difference to sports, and especially junior sports. I'd like to thank the junior football club president, Salv Mileto; at Little Athletics, Bol Woutars; at the cricket club, Phil Anning; and at the baseball club, Greg Clutterbuck. When I first visited the Little Athletics area and also the junior football club, they told me no government council has ever helped their club out before. So this is fantastic news to support needy clubs in the electorate of La Trobe. It's something I'm very proud the Morrison government is doing every day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="193430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  A generation ago, 80 per cent of Australian kids used active transport to get to school every dayâwalking, cycling, scooting. Today, that figure is just 20 per cent. We really need to turn this around. 22 March was National Ride2School Day, a Bicycle Network initiative where schools around the country hold special events to encourage their students to use active transport to get to school. Making Ride2School Day a carnival event opens an opportunity for schools, parents and students to talk about what our community can do to get more children to use active transport. Indeed, on Ride2School Day the national active transport participation rate amongst kids increases to 60 per cent, a threefold increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across Australia, our kids need to be more active. Over 90 per cent of young Australians don't get the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Health experts tell me that using active transport to get to school is best way for our kids to get that activity and the No. 1 way we can reduce Australia's chronic disease burden.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nearly 1,000 school communities across Australia participated in Ride2School Day this year, and 10 of those schools were in my electorate in Melbourne's west. I personally sponsored five local schools to have Ride2School Day events at their schools. Point Cook P-9 College, Footscray City Primary School, Footscray Primary School, Footscray North Primary School and Altona Primary School each received a healthy breakfast of fresh fruit and baked goods and prizes for kids who rode, walked, scooted or skated to school. On the day, I went to Point Cook P-9 College and I was blown away how active their students were. Kids at Point Cook P-9 College use active transport at double the national average, and not just on Ride2School Day but all year round.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Point Cook P-9 College shows what is possible if our schools, families and government work together. After receiving a local council grant to install active travel paths, the school has been promoting active transport for years. They hold Point Cook P-9 College events each year and monitor their progress by doing a hands-up count every Wednesday. Point Cook P-9 College aren't content with 50 per cent of their students using active transport, though; they're about to relaunch their active travel paths program because they know more kids can be walking, cycling, skating or scooting to school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ride2School Day had a great turnout from our community in Melbourne's west, and it was great to see so many young people embracing the opportunity to be physically active and connect with one another. I want to thank Masters Fresh Fruit in Footscray Market, Bakers Delight, Ted's Cycles, the Transport Accident Commission, the City of Maribyrnong, Footscray police, Franjos Kitchen and Gerry's Bicycle Service &amp; Repair for their generous donations to our local schools for this day. Thank you to school communities for getting behind the day, to all the teachers and parents who volunteered to help serve up breakfast and marshal participants and, most of all, to all of the kids who got active on the day. I want to thank Bicycle Network for their important advocacy on this issue for many days. As I said at the beginning, 80 per cent of kids used to ride a bike at school or use active transport. Point Cook P-9 College and Ride2School Day show that doesn't have to be our past; it can also be Australia's future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  Last month saw the Bunbury Geographe Gift celebrate its second year, which brings some of the best athletes not only from around Australia but also internationally to the city of Bunbury. It is an event that combines two of my favourite things: sport and bringing people to our amazing south-west. The Bunbury Geographe Gift is a two-day athletic event attracting some of the most talented runners and sprinters to our region, similar to the Stawell Gift and the Leonora Golden Gift in the Goldfields.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first Bunbury Geographe Gift was held last year and featured Olympic athletes and Commonwealth Games medal winners, as well as some of the most talented juniors in our great country. Athletes and their families and friends flocked to Bunbury for the inaugural Bunbury Geographe Gift, allowing these visitors to enjoy not just Bunbury itself but also the entire south-west. Volunteers and organisers worked around the clock to make it one of the best inaugural events ever held in our region, with races ranging from 90-metre sprints to longer distances across a range of age groups, culminating in the men's and women's 120-metre gift. One of Bunbury's finest athletes, Dylan Panizza, made the final of the major race, where he came fourth against some of the best sprinters from across Australia. This was a fantastic achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, as an opener for the event, a pole vault competition was held in the main street of Bunbury, which saw some of the best competitors in Australia, including Commonwealth Games medallist Nina Kennedy, impress the large crowd gathered in the CBD. This year's Bunbury Geographe Gift saw a 54 per cent increase in competitors, as well as an impressive increase in sponsorship, which meant that it was free entry for all spectators. This year's women's gift winner was Perth sprinter Eliza Wilson, while the men's event was won by South Australian athlete Jesse Cordoma.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After only two years, the Bunbury Geographe Gift is one of the most anticipated events in my electorate of Forrest in the south-west and has brought a welcomed boost to local tourism and hospitality. I want to thank those who helped put this event together, some of those including Colin Piacentini, Tom Dillon, Dylan Panizza, Jo O'dea and the host of volunteers who work behind the scenes. I would also like to thank the Bunbury Runners Club for their hard work in hosting the event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's after only two years that the Bunbury Geographe Gift has become one of the highlights of the south-west sporting calendar, and I look forward to seeing it grow bigger and better in the future. But mostly I would like to say thank you very, very much to all of the volunteers who work tirelessly for weeks and months in advance to make these events happen. There's always a small group; they are outstanding people and great people in my community. They do a fantastic job, and this event is the result.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  April is World Autism Month. Autism affects one in 58 children. As a matter of fact, 85 per cent of Australians diagnosed with autism are under the age of 25. That's why it's important that, as a society, we better understand and certainly encourage those diagnosed with autism and give them all the help and assistance they need to reach their full potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My Western Sydney electorate of Fowler is, as you know, Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, incredibly diverse. It's very colourful and very vibrant. However, my electorate is also over-represented with people with a disability, and, in particular, families that live with autism. As a matter of fact, more than half of all families living in New South Wales with autism live within a 20-kilometre radius of the Liverpool CBD.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being one of the most multicultural communities in Australia means that families in my community often struggle to access and fully understand the services available to them. Raising a child with autism certainly requires incredible patience and persistence. Sadly, 80 per cent of families that live with autism are single-parent families. Clearly the impact of raising a child with autism undoubtedly adds incredible stress to relationships. That's why we must work towards cultivating a community founded on acceptance and understanding to better ensure that those with autism are not limited or defined by their diagnosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My grandson Nathaniel is on the spectrum, and I very much understand the challenges faced by these families. Nathaniel is an incredibly bright and able person, he's someone I'm extremely proud of, and it gives me reassurance that those with autism can achieve great things if they are offered the right support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to say that the Autism Advisory and Support Service in Liverpool is a great source of comfort to families not only in my community but across the state. It operates a 24/7 service and supports families in desperate need. Grace Fava, who only recently received the Order of Australia, founded the AASS. She often sees families who are at their wits' end and in dire need of help. She supports families struggling to access support through agencies like the NDIS and those feeling let down by the system. Like her organisation, we should all be working towards building a community that ensures that those with autism are accepted in the normal fabric of our society, without prejudice, without limitations, and can, like the rest of us, reach their full potential.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  Please excuse me, colleagues, but I am fortunate to represent the best electorate in Australia. Bennelong is the home of innovation, from wi-fi to the Granny Smith apple, and is the base of dozens of the country's most innovative businesses. We are the most multicultural electorate in the country, with tens of thousands of locals who once called somewhere else home. We are a rich community of excellent schools, supportive families, hardworking small businesses, charities and volunteerism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, our greatest challenge is overdevelopment. Overdevelopment is the disease; congestion is the symptom. This is why I've been pushing the government for more support to bust congestion, and they have listened. We are already getting over $3 million from the Urban Congestion Fund to upgrade the bottleneck at Balaclava and Blaxland Roads. With this fund being quadrupled in this week's budget, I'm confident we will be able to secure more fixes to our infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overdevelopment is just development without supporting infrastructure. I've been a tireless advocate for better infrastructure. The $100 million Macquarie Park interchange will connect our high-rise developments, largest shopping hub and business park with our local bus network and the brand-new Northwest Metro. The Northwest Metro is particularly exciting, as most of our traffic is imported from the north-west. When this modern and efficient Metro line opens in the next few weeks, we should see an enormous reduction in the number of cars on our roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also been a tireless advocate for high-speed rail, not because of the train itself but because it is the catalyst to decentralise our overburdened cities and suburbs. It's great to see both sides of parliament coming around to this thinking and the government pledging fast rail in the budget this week. We're not just funding transport infrastructure, though; we're putting $350,000 into rebuilding the old Scouts boatshed at Meadowbank, creating a new wharf for the community in the process. We're funding schools and students to record levels and we're supporting the state government in building and comprehensively upgrading over 10 schools. We're also putting our own Bennelong spin on the schools investment by repeating our table tennis in schools program and providing free table tennis tables to all schools, thanks to Hyundai.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much more happening locally, and I don't have the time to mention it all in detail. Our Bennelong Village Businesses initiative continues, with the help for small businesses that this week's budget sets out. Our fabulous volunteering groups are being supported like never before, through our grants program, as are our rich ethnic communities, who make our community so vibrant and diverse. It is a great honour to support this wonderful electorate in parliament. I hope to return to continue the good work in the 46th Parliament.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  New South Wales has now become the only state without an environment department. Having talked a lot about environment during the election campaign, one of the first acts of Premier Berejiklian in the new parliament has been to abolish the Office of Environment and Heritage. Environment ends up in the planning department, which is exactly where it shouldn't be. The environmental problems facing the state include more than a thousand plant and animal species threatened with extinction; an 800 per cent increase in land clearing during the past three years; waterways like the Darling that are in crisis; and those in my electorate of Macquarie that are neglected. It means that, on major development projects, there is no unconflicted voice in the New South Wales government for the environmentâno voice for habitat under threat by the proposed raising of the Warragamba Dam wall, no voice for the koalas that populate the mountains when more housing is planned, no voice for the environmental impacts of major projects like a second Sydney airport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving Heritage to the Arts portfolio shows how little they care. Heritage isn't just a block of sandstone in Macquarie Street. In the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury, it is all around us and it is disappearing. The Aboriginal heritage that will be flooded if the Warragamba wall goes higher is part of who we all are, and deserves a strong voice to protect it. As the community who have for 2,084 days kept a 24-hour vigil in Thompson Square in Windsor know, heritage is already too easily sacrificed by this Liberal government. I pay tribute to the CAWBies, as they let the RMS take over Australia's oldest public square. New South Wales now has even less chance of anything from Aboriginal or colonial past surviving the rampaging and vandalism of the New South Wales Liberals, doing the bidding of developers with a grotesque conflict of interest embedded in their new bureaucracy. We need Labor's strong federal environmental laws more than ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government continues to let down parents and educators of preschoolers. This week's budget has no long-term funding for four-year-oldsâjust a one-year extension. There's no guarantee that the essential subsidy which helps cover the cost of a preschool program, whether it's community preschool or a long day care centre, will continue beyond that. Now, how do you plan to expand child care or keep staff if you've only got one year of subsidy? We know that every dollar invested in early education pays huge dividends, and 15 hours of subsidy for four-year-olds is a minimum. Fantastic preschools in my electorate in the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains know this, and all they've got after six years of a Liberal government is uncertainty. Labor will extend the subsidy to three-year-olds and make it permanent, fully funded and fully costed. We're the only ones who will invest in this country's future leaders.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  As members in this chamber and in the other place will know, on many occasions I've spoken about the No. 1 issue for my constituents; that is, congestion of roads in the electorate of Menzies. This is in part caused by the increasing population growth of Melbourne, on track to become the largest city in Australia, but also the topography of Melbourne. One of my boundaries is the Yarra River. It stretches for dozens of kilometres, yet there are just three crossings of that river. For traffic that wants to traverse the northern and north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Greensborough and Eltham further out, to the south-eastern suburbs, they have to cross the river at one of these three places. Equally, traffic coming off the northern ring road that wants to connect with the Eastern Freeway and EastLink has to use one of these three crossings to traverse the Yarra. The consequence of that is that, for hours every day, there are huge hold-ups and traffic jams out in suburban Menzies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that my constituents have been saying to me for some time now, which I've reflected in remarks in this place, is that we need to improve these pinch points, and, in particular, improve the pinch point where Fitzsimons Lane crosses the Yarra River between Templestowe to the south and Eltham to the north. Fitzsimons Lane itself is not the problem. Despite being called a laneâthat goes back to the 1800s, when, indeed, it wasâit's now a four-lane highway. But at the end of a couple of kilometres of four-lane highway, we go back to normal state roads. At the south there's a huge traffic build-up on Williamsons Road and Porter Street, and at the northern end there's a huge traffic build-up near Eltham and Montmorency on Main Road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased, therefore, to take the cities minister, the Hon. Alan Tudge, out to show him this build-up of traffic, which occurs every day in the morning, in the afternoon and, indeed, increasingly throughout the day, to show him what the problem was and to plead with him and urge him to provide funding from the budget in order to resolve or help to resolve this ongoing problem. Ultimately, the North East Link will deal with this, for which the Commonwealth is providing some $1.75 billion. But until that is built, which is some years away, traffic congestion will continue to be a problem. I was delighted, therefore, to announce with the minister just a few weeks ago $10 million worth of funding: $5 million for the city of Manningham and $5 million for the shire of Nillumbikâso either end of Fitzsimons Laneâto deal with this major traffic congestion. That's funding out of the 2018-19 budget; in other words, that's funding there ready to be spent on projects that will ease congestion to the benefit of my constituents, to get them to work and get them home earlier than they otherwise would.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  In the wake of the New South Wales election, it's full steam ahead with the Liberals' disastrous proposal for a massive cruise ship terminal in Yarra Bay. In the campaign for the state seat of Maroubra, where Yarra Bay is situated, all of the local candidates opposed this crazy proposal. Even the unsuccessful Liberal candidate vowed to fight Gladys Berejiklian to stop the looming catastrophe in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know is that the current Prime Minister, the member for Cook, has gone missing in action on the question of a cruise ship terminal at Yarra Bay, despite the fact that his electorate is within sight of the proposed development of the terminal. We also know that it was the then Liberal Prime Minister, the former member for Wentworth, who made a captain's call to rule out Garden Island as the preferred location in Sydney for this new cruise ship terminal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former New South Wales Liberal state leader Peter Collins was appointed as the head of the Cruise Industry Reference Group. His job was to identify possible solutions to the current crush of cruise ships coming into Sydney Harbour. The preferred option for an additional cruise ship terminal was Garden Island West, with option 2 being North-East Garden Island. Further down the list of recommendations by the reference group, it clearly stated that options 3 and 4 were Molineaux Point/Botany Bay, and Yarra Bay/Botany Bay respectively. They called for consultation with Indigenous local community representatives in accordance with environmental standards. This, of course, hasn't happened, and the community may pay the price.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Politics has trumped sensible policy. Once again the Bidjigal<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>people, the traditional owners of that land, whose ancestors have inhabited those shores for tens of thousands of years and have called Yarra Bay their home, have not been consulted about this disastrous plan. They say that a cruise ship terminal in their backyard will destroy local traditional fishing areas and livelihoods. There would be massive environmental damage from this proposal. Once again, Botany Bay would have to be dredged, and it's a haven for the weedy sea dragon and the pygmy pipehorse, which are protected species in Australia. And of course recreation in the bay would be severely affected, particularly for the Yarra Bay Sailing Club, which conducts its sailing events in the bay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The numbers don't add up. The independent review shows that accommodating a cruise ship terminal at Garden Island would only be $143 million, yet taxpayers would be asked to foot the bill for over half a billion dollars if it was located at Yarra Bay. This proposal simply does not make sense. I will oppose the cruise ship terminal at Yarra Bay because it is not in the best interests of the people in our community, and I call on the Prime Minister, the member for Cook, to do the sameâto get on the phone to Gladys Berejiklian and rule out a cruise ship terminal for Yarra Bay.</span>

There has been record funding for New South Wales government hospitals in Taree, Wauchope, Port Macquarie and Maitland, and also massive increases in funding of aged care.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I assumed responsibility for caring for the Lyne electorate, aged-care funding was only $90 million a yearâand we have one of the oldest and most ageing demographics in the nation. That funding is now above $135 million annually. We've got capital works extensions occurring in Forster at Pacific Cape, a massive 144-bed complex. There are also grants of $8 million for expansion to Bundaleer in Wauchope; in Taree; in Largs; for Banyula Village in Old Bar; at Bushland Health seniors' living complex in Taree; in Hawks Nest; and we have just turned the sod on a brand-new nursing home and seniors complex in Gloucester.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other day, I had the honour of announcing $8Â½ million for Bushland Health to start work on their $28 million vertical seniors' living complex on the banks of the mighty Manning River. This grant will fund public infrastructure which will allow this development to go ahead. Bushland Health's seniors living complex is the first cab out of the rank. There is a master plan for a $455 million residential, commercial and public space development which will be catalysed by this investment. There will be 180 jobs in the Bushland Health projects alone.</span>

A new library, public space, retail and community spaces in Forster will result. This is a massive growth in aged care across the electorate.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BYRNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  When you drive south along Clyde Road to Tooradin or north towards Berwick, depending on which part of Clyde Road you're on, you see the new Casey Hospital. It's been renovated by the Andrews state Labor government. If there is anything that symbolised the investment of the Andrews state Labor government in our regionâin the state seat of Cranbourne, in particular and in Narre south and Narre northâwith the huge infrastructure investment by Daniel Andrews, it's the Casey Hospital. It's the roads that have been built, it's the schools that have been built and it's the hospitals that have been built. It's the social infrastructure that's been built by the Andrews Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that period of time, in that four years, we've had a Labor government investing in what people need in the outer south-eastern suburbs. But what we haven't had is a partner, a federal partner, that would seek to co-invest with us to ensure that the people in our region get the infrastructure that they need and they deserve, and what they pay their taxes for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine my delight when the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, came down to Thompsons Road on Sunday morning 24 March to announce an $850 million co-investment with the Andrews Labor government to invest in roads in the south-east. We were on Thompsons Road, which is a key east-west feeder road for the south-eastern region. It affects seats like Dunkley, Isaacs, La Trobe, my seat and Flinders. It's a key east-west movement point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so for people in the outer suburbs to see the Leader of the Opposition there sent a very powerful signal. He was standing along Dan Andrews, as I was, when we announced a co-investment: an $850 million upgrade to congested roads. It will also create new jobs and, obviously, slash travel times for residents of the south-eastern suburbs. It's a partnership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this means in Holt is that an extra lane will be added each way, in each direction, to the Narre Warren-Cranbourne Road in Cranbourne. And we're also going to invest $65 million towards the completion of the upgrade and duplication of the 10.7 kilometre stretch of Thompsons Road between the Dandenong-Frankston Road and the Berwick-Cranbourne Road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're Australia's fastest-growing cityâthat's Melbourneâbut despite being home to a quarter of our population we've received a spend as little as 7c in the dollar on infrastructure from the federal government. This state, Victoria, needs; the country needs; and Holt needs a Shorten Labor government to co-invest with Daniel Andrews to give them the infrastructure that they need.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:34</span>):  My vision for Moore is to see the city of Joondalup continue to grow and prosper and become a safe, vibrant regional city which provides locals with employment opportunities close to home. Over the past 5Â½ years I have been extremely fortunate to represent the electorate of Moore, which is home to the pristine northern coastline as well as the economic hub of the city of Joondalup.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am committed to ensuring continued access to world-class health care at our local Joondalup hospital, which will be extended; a wide variety of professional services within the emerging central business district of Joondalup; and higher education opportunities within our innovative learning precinct at Edith Cowan University and the North Metropolitan TAFE to develop the skilled workforce of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to working cooperatively with the business community to promote Joondalup as a destination for tourism and investment and to develop new business opportunities and markets for our products and services. Together we must promote the commercialisation of Australian research and development and the application of innovative and new technology into our industries to drive employment growth for our residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to continuing as a strong advocate for increased federal funding for roads, infrastructure and essential services such as health, education and defence to benefit my community of Moore. May I take this opportunity to thank all of my retiring colleagues and the staff at Parliament House for their dedicated service and wish them well for their future. I thank the community for placing its trust in me and respectfully seek that support to continue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  At this time of the year in my community we're all out in force celebrating the many key cultural festival activities that have now become annual events in our areas, making the federal seat of Calwell the most multicultural electorate in all of Australia. Last weekend alone we celebrated community new year festivals, and we are still celebrating International Women's Day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Sunday my day began bright and early at the Highgate Recreation Reserve in Craigieburn to celebrate Sri Lankan New Yearâa wonderful day for the Sri Lankan community to enjoy its cultural and sporting activities. This is organised by the North Victoria Welfare and Cultural Association. I want to thank Chandra Bamunusinghe for the tremendous work he does to make this a Sinhalese-Tamil celebration. This has been the case for many years now. For me, then it was off to Broadmeadows to the Seabrook Reserve to celebrate the Assyrian New Year. Following that, I had to dash across to Dallas to celebrate the Chaldean Babylonian New Year, otherwise known as the Akitu festival. This was organised by The Australian Chaldean Federation of Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The night before thatâon Saturday nightâI had the opportunity to hit the dance floor, literally, with my Chaldean women's league, who were celebrating a belated International Women's Day function. I want to thank Jonar Warda in particular for organising this wonderful event. I can tell you it's always a joy to be amongst these wonderful women. They take such great pride in their appearance, and I'm going to declare them as the most beautiful women in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month I too held my annual International Women's Day celebrationâa morning tea at the Newbury Child and Community Centre in Craigieburn. I want to thank, in particular, Archana Nayak, Anne Coall and all the staff from the Newbury Child and Community Centre for helping out on that day and making it a really, really successful morning tea. I want to thank my local businesswoman Patricia Surace of Baked Provisions, who provided the very delicious cakes, muffins and treats that we all enjoyed. And, of course, I want to give a great shout-out to our mayor, Carly Moore, and our deputy mayor, Naim Kurt, from the Hume City Council for coming along on the day and sharing in the festivities with us. Lastly, I want to thank the good Samaritan school mothers, who themselves on the day provided great entertainment for us all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, one of my favourite days in the annual calendar is Harmony Day. It's a day to reflect on and celebrate the social cohesion and inclusiveness of our communities and to show our support for the diverse cultures and backgrounds. This year Harmony Day was celebrated by the Dallas Neighbourhood House. They did a wonderful job, and I congratulate them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to use my last speech in this parliament to thank the people who have made my life a great joy in being here. I want to start by thanking my conference. We have the largest and most diverse Liberal Party conference in New South Wales. It's ably led by Matt Cross, Helen McNamee, Michael McAuley, Tom Green and Susan Carter. I also want to acknowledge the former office-bearers, Kate Golder and Brian Jepsen. Probably more than any other person, Brian Jepsen is responsible for me being a parliamentarian, and I owe Brian more than I will be able to repay. I want to acknowledge Pat McNamee, who ran my campaign in 2016 and who is backed up for a second stint, and also Maria Kovacic, who is assisting him.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the staff who have served me. We are nothing as parliamentarians without our staff. I want to acknowledge Pip Englund, who headed up my office from the beginning until her family moved to Queensland at the end of last year. She did a magnificent job challenging me and encouraging me to be the best MP I could. Of Annette McHugh, who has come on board, she and I have been looking for many years for an opportunity to work together. She has great intellectual and emotional intelligence and an ability to look at old problems from new angles and never loses her enthusiasm for this place or the project we're trying to achieve. Daniel Dummer has been with me almost from the beginning. He served so many constituents. They've benefited from his advice and his hard work, and he's literally changed lives. Two Traceys have served as my EA: Tracey Shute and Tracey Barrowcliff. I pinch myself every day that such experienced, dedicated people have given up their time and choose to come and work with me. Annie Phillips has been running our media activities. She follows a long line of people that includes Dan Mumford, Gus McManus and Tom O'Brien, all of whom have gone on to bigger and better things in different fields.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  In the last few weeks we have seen the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and a number of ministers come down to Geelong to announce a $2 billion project to build a fast railâa bullet trainâbetween Geelong and Melbourne. In addition to that, there has been an announcement badged as 'Saving Sarah', the member for Corangamite: a $700 million promise to duplicate the rail line between South Geelong and Waurn Ponds in the southern suburbs of Geelong. The total $2.7 billion worth of promises sounds pretty good. This has been put forward as: 'This is going to happen. It is a commitment by government.' In fact, it's a complete hoax. Of the $2.7 billion that has been talked about in respect of those two announcements, what we discovered in the federal budget on Tuesday night was $100 million. Of the $2.7 billion, there is 0.1 actually provided for in the federal budget. In respect of the fast rail, the Prime Minister was talking about construction within the next couple of years. The reality when you look at the budget is that there is a $50 million commitment towards it in the second half of the forwards, and that begins with a feasibility study, a fact which the Prime Minister has acknowledged himself, which means there is no chance that there is going to be construction within that period of time. There is no intent whatsoever on the part of the coalition to build a fast train between Geelong and Melbourne. This is nothing other than peddling false hope. This is all about a headline. It is not about substance at all. In respect of the duplication of the line from South Geelong to Waurn Ponds, what was committed to in the federal budget on Tuesday night would actually represent a slowing-down of the time frame for the delivery of what is a really important piece of infrastructure that the state Labor government committed to in its election last November.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you actually unpack these miraculous announcements, the truth is that there is very little there. There is no intention to actually do anything, and, to the extent that they have walked into the space, it is to such a modest degree that it will actually slow down the progress of what infrastructure is being built. I can tell you this: the most successful entity in terms of building infrastructure in Victoria in living memory has been this state government. If a Shorten government is elected, we will work closely with the Daniel Andrews Labor government at a state level to deliver fast transport between Melbourne and Geelong, as has been committed to by the state government. We will be more ambitious than the federal government has been in terms of its interventions here, which to this point in time have been nothing other than a hoax.</span>

With the support of the Mudgee and Districts Can Assist branch, it was named Community Event of the Year. The 11th annual Can Cruise was recently held, and I'm told it was a huge success, with 220 cars participating and $25,000 raised.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  Recently, Saint Francis of the Fields Primary School student Chelsea Breene wrote to me about her concerns on climate change, or the inaction of this place in relation to climate change. Saint Francis of the Fields is one of our Catholic schools based in Strathfieldsaye. I was invited by Chelsea to come and meet with her and her fellow students to discuss this issue. They raised a number of concerns. Particularly important to Chelsea was a crackdown on plastic, making sure that we stop plastic getting into our waterways. She wanted to see us ban the plastic bag in particular. The students raised concerns about the use of thermal coal, particularly in relation to the impact that it is having on our carbon emissions. They raised lots of ideas that they had on how we can better address and act on climate change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was similar to a conversation that I had with the students at Castlemaine North Primary School. I should give a shout-out to the Castlemaine North Primary School students for the conversation that we had about what they would do if they were the Prime Minister of this country. They said they would crack down on illegal dumping, particularly of rubbish. They said they wanted to see greater protection for species in danger. They also expressed their concern about climate change. There are other issues that they raised that they would address if they were Prime Minister. Some students said that we're not doing enough to support people who are homeless, that we need to make sure we help those most in need so that they have a comfortable home and enough money to buy food. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final school I wish to really give a shout-out today is St Ambrose Parish Primary School in Woodend. They've been here this week and they had the opportunity to do the tour of Parliament House. Last Friday we held a leadership forum with the mayor of the Macedon Ranges shire. We held a political forum and discussionâour own <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A</span>. In that, the students asked questions about local infrastructure. They also asked questions about women in leadership. They couldn't understand why in 2019 we don't have fifty-fifty representation of women in this parliament. They didn't buy the merit argument that's been put forward by those opposite. They really were surprised. They supported Labor's position and where we will be after the next election. They asked whether it was about the workplace, about the culture or about the way in which we support women in politics in regard to caring responsibilities. I did say, 'It's all of the above, but some of us here are working on it.' These students from across these schools are our future leaders, and we can be very proud of them. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  The Liberal-National coalition's strong and responsible economic management over the last 5Â½ years is delivering great results for rural and regional Australia and certainly in my electorate of Murray. Since being elected to represent the people of Murray, I've had the honour to work with primary producers, local government, business owners, industry leaders, community groups and health providers to deliver a range of productive outcomes for the whole community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most important infrastructure projects for the region that has been advocated over the last 10 to 20 years has been the Shepparton bypass. It was a fantastic honour to be able to announce federal funding for the first stage of the Shepparton bypass earlier this week. We've only been able to achieve this $208 million in funding because of the financially strong position that the federal government finds itself in, and because of the Nationals playing a strong part in that responsible government. I've been able to work very closely with the Deputy Prime Minister, who is Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, over the last few years. I want to thank Minister McCormack for making the bypass funding a reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a core belief of the National Party and I'm sure of the Liberal Party that we have to at least make sure we can balance the books before we can deliver for all Australians and before we can look after all of the vulnerable people, which is our main aim. As most people would know, the poorest Australians tend to live in National Party seats. We are proud to represent them and fight for them as hard as we possibly can. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago, we were also able to announce a $15 million injection into FRUITCo. The fruit industry has an opportunity to bring its competitiveness forward when it comes to the processing and the packing side of its industry. In Australia we're currently let down by our packing and sorting processes. This injection into the infrastructure around the fruit industry is much needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in relation to infrastructure, the Mitiamo pipeline project is in the throes of being funded. We've been working very closely with Minister McCormack, and that announcement is imminent. It's a fantastic project that will bring reliable, clean, high-quality water to over 200 farms that currently don't have it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only last week I was able to announce, with Minister Chester, a memorial to Brigadier Sir Murray Bourchier. He was a fantastic military figure from the Goulburn Valley who led the charge at the Battle of Beersheba and helped turn the course of the First World War. His great-great-niece Lucy is in the parliament as part of a delegation as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265975" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAMB</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  Today is almost certainly the last sitting day of this 45th Parliament, and under the Liberalsâunder Prime Minister Turnbull and under Prime Minister Scott Morrisonâthese last three years have been nothing short of chaotic. Of course, in the years before that, under Prime Minister Abbott, they weren't much better either. Year after year, budget after budget, our community has been attacked, disappointed and let down by the Liberals. We live in a wonderful community in the electorate of Longman. It is full of regular hardworking Australian people, but government have turned their backs on us, because their priorities simply lie with the top end of town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Tuesday night the Treasurer released his budget. After six years of the Liberals' cuts and chaos, and around six weeks before an election, this budget was their last chance to reverse the cuts to the essential services that everyday Australians rely upon. But again Longman residents have been let down by the same cuts to hospitals, schools, pensions, penalty rates and TAFE. While, unfortunately, that didn't come as a surprise to me, what I wasn't quite prepared for was what the government did in this budget. This time they're relying on a huge, $1.6 billion underspend on the NDIS to fund this con of a budget. It is an absolute disgrace. It is not an achievement at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, will announce Labor's positive plan for Australia. He will reaffirm the commitment that a Labor government will have different priorities to the Liberals. Labor will prioritise working people over the top end of town. We will prioritise hospitals and schools over banks. While this government has given up governing, Labor will be leading the way forward. We have a plan that will bring back a fair go for people in my communityâfor people at Bribie, for people in Caboolture and Woodford, Narangba, Burpengary and Wamuran. We're sticking up for local workers and standing up for what's fair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For far too long my community has been let down by this Liberal government's misguided priorities. That's why I'm proud to be standing with Labor to reverse the Liberals' cutsâto reinvest the millions they ripped out of our local schools; to put the $2.9 million back into Caboolture Hospital; and to give the many, many workers who've had their take-home pay slashed under the Liberals their hard-earned penalty rates back. I know that in six weeks, when the election rolls around, the people of Longman won't forget what the Liberals have done in the last six years. They won't forget the cuts and they won't forget the chaos. They want someone to stand up and fight for them, to stand up for a fair go. Tonight in Labor's budget reply we'll show them that's only possible under a Shorten Labor government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Benny attended Wilson Park Special School during his primary years. After turning 18, he worked at Summerland House Farm, formally known as House With No Steps, and he recently received a medal for his dedication to the job after 35 years service at the farm. From customers to staff, he greets them with a smile. He will go out of his way to help people and is very well known there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Benny also loves his sport. He's a life member of the Marist Brothers Rams Rugby League Club, a president of the Lismore City Rugby Club and an avid Broncos fan and Queensland supporter in State of Origin. I forgive you for that, Benny!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">His dedication to the Rams earned him his nickname, Benny the Ram. He's one of the hardest workers at the club, and he's also their mascot. Before every home game he sets up the pads on the posts, he puts out the bins, he sets up the canteen and does the barbecue. At every Christmas event he plays Santa Claus, and he even has his own Santa business card. At one time, Benny was a regular on local radio station 2LM, sharing his footy tips every week with Neil Marks.</span>

After her death 11 years ago he has looked after himself ever since. He has two sisters, Mara and Jane, who are very proud of their brother. Benny, congratulations on reaching your milestone of 35 years at Summerland House Farm. Your mother would be very proud of you, and so are we.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dakoda Walters from Angourie has just finished competing in the Key Sun Zinke Sydney Pro Junior surfing event in Manly, where he finished runner-up in his first pro junior final. This has put him in the world top 5 of junior surfers. I want to congratulate him on that. I also want to acknowledge other local surfers who are doing very well. Chris Zaffis from Angourie is ranked 110th in the men's qualifying series, Taj Watson from Moonee Beach is 13th in the junior series, Callum Robson is 96th in the men's qualifying series, Zack McMahon from Evans Head is 23rd in the junior series, and Carly Shanahan from Wooli is fifth in the junior series.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="91219" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  So much promise was invested in the budget this week. This was the budget of the Morrison government, following on from the Turnbull and Abbott governments. This would be the clean break where we would see a whole different direction and new ideas that would be potentially emerging out of this document. There was much faith and very little to show for it as a result of Tuesday night because, despite the promise that there would be a lot of difference in this budget as a result of this new Prime Minister and a new Treasurer, we pretty much saw more of the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see this particularly in the portfolio that I am proud to be a shadow minister for, Human Services, where we saw not a clean break but a continuation of the same old agenda when it comes to Centrelink and Medicare. In respect of the Department of Human Services, what did we see? Over many years we have seen job cuts, we have seen worsening service and we have seen complaints soar. What we saw on Tuesday night, again, was more of the same. It can be summed up in this way: more jobs to go, more robo-debt to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that stood out in my mind was more job cuts at the Department of Human Services. Two hundred jobs that we have identified have been targeted to go out of the Department of Human Services. It's not enough that they've cut 2,500 jobs from the Department of Human Services in the last few years, principally covering Centrelink and Medicare; they're cutting more. Not satisfied with the jobs that have gone, they're cutting more jobs out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that was revealed in that budget is the expected $2 billion saving on the way in which income will be treated through what is known as the Single Touch Payroll system and the automation of decision-making in there. There's no problem with applying technology to do things efficiently if you have thought ahead about the impact. We saw what happened with automated decision-making under this government through robo-debt, where people were sent notices of debts that they did not owe because the system had not been designed properly. This is a disgrace. People were sent debt notices, they paid them and they never actually owed the debt. This government is looking to potentially ratchet that up in what it's claiming will be a $2 billion saving. As I said, under this budget: more jobs to go, more robo-debt to come, no lessons learned by this government and no change in the way that they're treating the recipients who use Centrelink and Medicare services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our side of politics is committed to different. We have said we will invest in better jobs and better service. We have announced in the last year 1,200 jobsâpermanent full-time roles in Centrelink and Medicare across the country in places where there is high need for those services or where an investment in those jobs will mean something for local economies and communities. I have been proud of the announcements that we have made through the course of the year designed to do just that. We want to see a reduction in wait times. We want to see improvements in service. We want to see permanent full-time roles where people are trained up and can provide the service required instead of always running to a contractor to provide those services, as those opposite do. Centrelink, for the coalition, is simply a targetâa target to cut jobs, to cut service and to make life harder for average Australians. It's just wrong, and Labor are committed to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my final moments in respect of this speech, I want to send out a huge congratulations to Yasodai Selvakumaran, a humanities teacher in her ninth year at Rooty Hill High School in my electorate of Chifley. Rooty Hill High has been doing some terrific things, thinking ahead about how to prepare young people in our area in Western Sydney for, particularly, the way that work will roll out into the future and building up their skills. Rooty Hill High was named as one of Australia's 40 most innovative schools in 2016 and 2017, and Yasodai was recognised as one of the 30 rising stars under the age of 35 in Australian education by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Educator</span> magazine. I want to congratulate Yas for recently being shortlisted as a top 10 candidate for the 2019 Global Teacher Prize. She travelled to Dubai to represent our community. We are extremely proud of her achievements, her dedication and what she's doing to prepare young people for jobs of the future.</span>

One of the reasons we can fund and support some of these terrific organisations and groups is this government is managing the budget well, and we've got an economy that, as a result, is providing the resources to the government to fund these organisations. It is a dividend to our communities as a result of their hard work and enterprise that this government has encouraged.</span>

Logan Basketball look after some 3,000 players across five clubs at the Cornubia Park Sports Centre and they do an outstanding job, led by Sandra and Joshua in particular. I'm pleased to say that the government has invested $264,000 as part of the Move It AUS Community Sport Infrastructure grantâ</span>

                  </a>  As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted, one of the great clubs in my electorate is Logan Basketball. We've had the pleasure of providing them with an additional $264,000 of funding under the community sport infrastructure grant program. This funding will go to building new change room facilities at Logan Basketball. This means a lot to the club because the club is continuing to grow. Funding these new change rooms will see increased participation and the club continue to grow, particularly the women's section of the club. The change rooms are currently in poor condition, particularly for the women. During this period of growth we're seeing enormous growth in women's participation. Separating the change rooms will give added incentive for women to come back and play basketball.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Logan Basketball was formed 21 years ago. It was the first basketball club formed in Logan. I'm proud to say that this government is prioritising investment in grassroots local sporting clubs because it recognises the wider health, social and community benefits that come from greater activity and participation in sport.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another terrific community organisation in my electorateâand it also covers areas of Rankinâis the Street Doctor, which a Logan City medical service provider set up to provide further help and support to the homeless, those suffering domestic violence, the vulnerable and the disadvantaged. It has been operating for over four years. The Street Doctor delivers after-hours bulk-billed and accessible care in a secure environment for those living rough on the streets. It was interesting talking to them about the services they provide and the people that they see. This terrific service fulfils a great need in our community, as, sadly, there are a number of people in our community who are disconnected and, for whatever reason, don't have the connections and support mechanisms necessary to engage more fully in society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week we announced $600,000 worth of funding to Street Doctor for them to extend their service and to better help those most disadvantaged; that's $200,000 a year over the next three years. In addition, we provided $600,000 to Pharmaceutical Rehabilitation Services in my electorate. This is a targeted program with a focus on drug and alcohol treatment, preventing primary disease, chronic disease management and mental health. PRS engages with local GPs to assist them with patients who have drug and alcohol dependency, and also to help with hep-C treatment methods.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This support to these organisations across our community is designed to help those most in need. I'm very proud to say that this government, through its prudent budget management, has the funds to support these great local organisations, and I thank them for the work they do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  Last week the Prime Minister made the right decision in directing all Liberal Party branches to place One Nation on the very bottom of their how-to-vote cards in the forthcoming election. I congratulate him for making the decision. I will overlook the fact that he exhausted every possible alternative to that decision before reaching the right thing to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The xenophobic, racist and bigoted comments, and the stunts and the vaulting hypocrisy, of the One Nation party deserve no place in our democracy. That last straw was drawn when it was revealed on ABC television last week that they had somehow sought to bring the poisoned, toxic and corrupt politics of the National Rifle Association into our democracy. There can be no place for this toxic, poisoned politics in Australian democracy. It corrupts our public debate, it is dangerous and we reject it utterly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What could have been a unifying moment for the entire nation, for every respectable political party in this country, unfortunately, did not come to pass. We've expected the member for Warringah to take every possible opportunity he can to be a perverse and ridiculous figure in Australian politics. But, frankly, I would have expected more from the National Party. The member for Warringah; and the member for Stirling, who is on his way out the door, said that One Nation, frankly, should be above Labor and many other parties on the how-to-vote card. But the National Party, a party which is hoping to win seats in the next election, has not taken that approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a time for leadership. It is incumbent upon every mainstream party that seeks to get elected and every serious candidate getting elected in seats to show leadership on this issue. There can be no place for racism and bigotry in the forthcoming election. It is the obligation of the National Partyâand I don't care whether it's in Queensland, where they're on razor-thin margins and think that they are reliant on One Nation preferences, or throughout New South Wales, Victoria or Tasmaniaâto do the right thing by Australian democracy and to do the right thing by their electorates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They should put One Nation last. But that's only the first thing they should do. They should then turn to their electors, to their citizens, and explain why. If I were the member for Dawson, for example, I would be explaining to my electors that we cannot say to the rest of the world: 'We want you to buy our wheat, we want you to buy our beef, we want you to buy our sugar and we want you to buy our coal and our iron ore, but we don't like you. We don't like you, we don't like the look of you and we don't like your religion. We don't want you to come and visit, and if you do come and visit we don't want you to stay.' This is unsustainable. It's morally wrong and it's not in the interest of those electorates. It's certainly not in the interest of any of those northern and Central Queensland electorates which rely on commodities from and trade with the rest of the world for their economic wellbeing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a very simple argument to make, and the challenge for all those LNP candidates in the forthcoming election is to do what I have just said: take the argument up to the bigots and take the argument up to the racists. If you can't do it on the basis that they're wrong, then do it on the basis that it is poor economic policy. The challenge is there for you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all of those clowns in the right-wing media who have attempted to create some sort of moral equivalence between One Nation and the Greens and other parties on the Left, let me make this point. There has to be a price for entry to mainstream politics in this country. We can argue about economic policy, we can argue about environmental policy, we can argue about law and justice and all of the other issues that we are faced with in this august parliament, but there are some things which are above argument, and they are bigotry and racism. There can be no place for bigotry and racism in this parliament or in our politics. It's the price of entry to Australian politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So once again I put the challenge out to all of the coalition parties: do the right thing. Follow the lead of Tim Fischer and all of those other old-school conservatives. Do the right thing. Put the bigots and racists last.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0D" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VASTA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  I'm proud to be part of a coalition government, a government that is making real progress and delivering for all Australians, including the constituents of my electorate of Bonner. I've been speaking to locals this week, and they've told me that they are pleased that the coalition has delivered a strong budget with no additional taxes, all while delivering essential services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the dad of two boys, aged six and four, it is very important to me and to my constituents that we are investing in our future generations. The coalition knows how important that is and that our nation's children need the best possible start in life. That's why we're investing $453 million to extend preschool education, enabling hundreds of thousands of children to have access to 15 hours of quality early learning per week in the year before school. Kerry from Tingalpa kindy told me that this investment is great for parents and families in Bonner. She said, 'If this funding wasn't available, local families would have to fork out thousands of dollars, meaning that for most children early learning education wouldn't be an option.' Kerry said, 'Local community childcare centres like Tingalpa kindy are run by the community, and, without this continual funding, the centres would not be viable to run.' Kerry said, 'Families in Bonner rely so heavily on this kindy funding, and if it didn't exist those who need it most would have less choice, and the children would miss out.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the coalition, funding for all public, independent and Catholic schools in Bonner is at a record high, and it will continually grow substantially in the decade ahead. We are committing around $300 billion to all schools. This is a total increase of 63 per cent. We are able to do this because we are the government of fiscal responsibility. We know how to live within our means and deliver for all of Bonner without imposing any new taxes on our hardworking families. We've invested $30.2 million to establish the Local School Communities Fund to support priority projects in local schoolsâprojects that benefit students and their communities. This means schools in Bonner can apply for project upgrades to libraries, classrooms and play equipment. The coalition knows how important investment in education is, but it's important also to improve skills, support our educators and deliver quality education. We are investing $5 million over the next three years, from 2019 to 2022, for Life Education Australia to develop a new range of free training resources to help teachers support the social and emotional needs of students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that Labor can't manage money, and that's why they come after yours. The constituents of Bonner can rest easy knowing the coalition is delivering for them. More than 71,000 constituents in Bonner will benefit from tax relief in 2018-19, thanks to the coalition's personal income tax plan, and almost 30,000 of those people will receive the full tax offset of $1,080 back into their own pockets. These are the largest personal income tax cuts since the time of the Howard government. For a family in Bonner, this money means more fuel, more food on the table and more quality time to do the things that families love doing together, like going to the movies or being able to drive to the beach for the day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also increased funding to all hospitals in Queensland by 84 per cent since we came to government, and the GP bulk-billing rate in Bonner is now 79 per cent. Last year, over 739,353 GP visits in Bonner were bulk-billed. That is 179,000 more than in Labor's last year in government. Thanks to the coalition, 17,564 small and medium businesses in Bonner will benefit from our tax relief measures. More than 17,000 small and medium businesses will also benefit from the coalition's extension of the instant asset write-off scheme, enabling them to invest in machinery and equipment up to the value of $30,000. Investing in business is investing in jobs. When the coalition assumed its rightful place in government in 2013, the unemployment rate in Bonner was 5.2 per cent; it's now 4.7 per cent. Nationally, there are fewer people on welfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're working hard for the hardworking people in Bonner. A strong economy means that the coalition is able to deliver and invest in vital infrastructure that communities like mine in Bonner desperately need. Just remember, Labor is the bill that you and your family cannot afford.</span>

                  <a href="LTU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Batman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  Every week or so I do a little video for my constituents of Cooper that updates them on what I've been up to in the electorate and what has been keeping the people of the electorate activated. I decided that I would bring that to parliament and do my 'Cooper Chronicles' update from here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you would know, it's budget week. I'm sure you've noticed that there is not much in the budget for the good people of Cooper. There are certainly no ideas, no great vision, for this country. Laura Tingle had it right when she wrote recently for the ABC:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A tumultuous six years of declared debt and deficit crises, culture wars and internal warfare, the Coalition's sixth Budget seems to reflect a government that has collapsed, exhausted, in on itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing that you, the good people of Cooper, care about has had a budget boost. That's including our beloved ABC, which I know the people of Cooper care very greatly about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weeks ago, the wonderful Linda Burney visited Cooper and she met with some families and individuals struggling with the NDIS. She met parents of children with really complex care needs who cannot get their packages updated in a timely manner to deliver the rapidly changing care needs of their children. They cannot get crucial updates for their houses, like ramps, and assistance with bathing their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We spoke to two families in particular. I have to say they were at the very limits of managing. I could see the tension and anxiety in their eyes. I could hear the exhaustion in their voices from the frustration of inaction by the agency, and I felt the tension and pressure that this situation had put them under. To think that the delays and underspending had been by design, to think that this government has willingly put those poor people through that to save money for a fake surplus, is beyond belief. You deserve better than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are jobs. There was a major dispute in Cooper that ended just last week. Workers at the distribution centre for Chemist Warehouse went on strike. They had major concerns about casualisation, worker harassment, poor wages. They won their dispute after a long and bitter battle, and I congratulate them and their union, the NUW. I was proud to go down and support them at their protestâthe workers and the other community members of Cooper who went down to help. Just imagine what your life is like if you have to wait for a text message at night-time to tell you that you have a shift the next day at work. The anxiety and insecurity that that creates is unbelievable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a situation for so many, and, if you are not in a workplace that is highly organised with your union, it is almost impossible to just go up and ask for a pay rise. You may not get that text that night; you may not get that next shift; you may not get that next pay packet. Insecure work, low wages and few rightsâit's a story that I hear over and over again from people in my electorate. There is nothing from this government to help raise wages. There is nothing from this government to ensure decent jobs and a living wage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I know also that climate is a huge issue for the people of Cooper. We have many wonderful activists in my seat who come and see me almost on a daily basis. They want action. They want urgent action. They want us to be on an emergency footing to deal with climate change. Labor will address this on a large scale. We have a large plan; we have a plan that is achievable. We have a plan that will make a difference, and it is ambitious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's so much that can be done on a local level in Cooper. Did you know, for example, that Cooper has some of the least canopied streets in the state? Yes, fewer trees means higher temperatures and add to global warming. We need to do something about that. We have some wonderful creeks in CooperâDarebin Creek, Merri Creek, Edgars Creekâand they are screaming out for care, for extra resources, to make sure that they stay clean. The management associations do a great job, but I'm pleased to say that we will commit $1 million to the waterways of Cooper to make sure they are clean.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have committed $4 million to the Moreland Energy Foundation to help establish community-run sustainable energy providers. We will put $40 million into extending the Gilbert Road tram. We will have Indigenous rangers. We know that these things are important to the people of Cooper, and I'm proud to say that I am in the Labor Party. Should we form government, we'll provide action on all of these things and make life better for the people in my electorate.</span>

Nationally, it delivers the first surplus inâhow long?â12 years. Did you hear that? Twelve years! There is $100 billion in infrastructure investment. There is $300 billion for schools and help with energy bills for older Australians, and it does it all while delivering $158 billion in lower income taxes.</span>

More than 20,000 businesses in my electorate will be eligible for the budget's extended and expanded instant asset write-off, with companies with a turnover of up to $50 million able to apply it to assets costing up to $30,000.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Liberal-National government can let Fisher residents and businesses keep more of their own money because we know how to build a strong economy. Labor want to slug the people of Fisher with $200 billion of new taxes, because their answer to everything is to spend other people's money. A strong economy means we can help people in Fisher to get home sooner and more safely by building the infrastructure our community deserves. In the last two budgets this Liberal-National government invested $3.13 billion in upgrades to the Bruce Highway between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, and $390 million to duplicate the North Coast railway line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget commits another $91.4 million to improving the Maroochydore Road interchange on the Bruce Highway. There's $3.65 million for making Sunshine Coast roads safer and $12 million to rebuild the bridge over Mayes Canal on Brisbane Road in Mooloolaba. Locals know that this is one of the major routes into Mooloolaba, and it is a terrible congestion hotspot. I've been advocating action to improve it, along with my friend John Connolly, the local councillor, and he has done a great job in advocating that, so well done to John. The new bridge will allow for two lanes each way and make a very big difference to Mooloolaba, for locals and tourists alike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong economy helps to create the jobs that local people want, but it also pays for the vital services that we need. This is the whyâwhy we have a strong economy; why we need to have budget surpluses. This budget continues the Liberal-National government's record investment in schools and hospitals. In the period to 2025, we'll see $266 million in extra funding for schools in Fisher and an estimated $261.7 million extra for our local hospitals. This budget invests a further $20 million in Fisher healthcare projects that are close to my heart and I've been fighting for on behalf of the local residents. Twelve million dollars will go to Wishlist, to build low- and no-cost accommodation for families visiting sick people at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital; $4Â½ million will be committed to the endED Butterfly House in Mooloolah Valley; and a further $2Â½ million will be committed to the Thompson institute. That's on top of the $5 million that we provided for them in the 2017 budget. That will go to dementia programs, youth mental health and suicide prevention. Only the Liberal-National government can afford to support these fantastic initiatives, and I wholly commend the budget.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="262273" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEAY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  Almost three years ago I was extremely fortunate to be elected to this place by the good people of Braddon. It is remarkable that, over the last three years, the issues and challenges for my region have remained the same. And those issues will remain the same unless there is a change of government. The budget handed down this week by the Prime Minister and his Treasurer has confirmed that the people of Braddon will be better off under a Shorten Labor government. In all the key priority areas for our region, Labor has a better planâfor health, education, TAFE, apprenticeships, tax cuts, jobs and economic growth, and let's not forget wages. This government has no plan to help boost the wages of people in my electorate. My local paperâ<span style="font-style:italic;">The Advocate</span>, the wonderful Fairfax daily paper in my electorateâtoday talks about how subdued wages have led to a significant decline in retail turnover. That's not good for businesses in my electorate. But this government has forgotten those people who earn under $40,000 a year. In my electorate, the gross income for 25 per cent of people is $33,000 a year or less. This government has completely forgotten them. We've got a household median income that is $330 a week less than the Australian median income, and this government doesn't really seem to care about the people in my electorate. Let's talk about penalty rates. Because this government hasn't acted on penalty rates, it has cost businesses in my electorate $10 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many issues that I could speak on in the time that I have, but I want to particularly focus on two: support for our farmers and support for our people when they are unwell. During the 2016 election, farmers in my electorate were devastated by a combination of flood and dairy price clawbacks. They wanted government support, but none of that was given. The minister at the time, the member for New England, couldn't even be bothered to come down and speak to my farmers. But now, three years on, farmers are telling me they want support from government to increase their productivity, increase local jobs and grow our economy. They want government to invest in more irrigation, building upon Labor's tranche 1 and 2 Tasmanian irrigation schemes. I note the irony in those opposite turning up in Tasmania in recent times taking credit for the completion of tranche 2 schemes. They forget that every irrigation scheme constructed in Tasmania over the last 20 years has been either planned or funded by Labor. For the last six years, this government has done nothingâa lack of vision, a lack of leadership. So once again it's up to Labor to lead the way and roll out the next phase of Tasmanian irrigation projects. A Shorten Labor government will provide $100 million towards these projects, many of which are in my electorate of Braddon, in our wonderful dairying areas in the far north-west. But this government offers Tasmanian farmers nothingânot a centâfor irrigation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shortly after I was elected in 2016, I received an email from Dr John O'Sullivan from the Devonport GP Superclinic. Dr O'Sullivan was concerned that this government had axed a fund called TAZREACH that enabled visiting medical specialists to come to his practice and many areas in my region, including the west coast of Tasmania, Circular Head and King Island. His concerns at the time were shared by the West Coast Council mayor, Phil Vickers, who said that this loss was detrimental to his community. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The loss of these services places more stress on unwell residents and will also place more pressure on these services in other regions as West Coasters will now have to travel to attend appointments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three years later these health cuts remain in place. Sick people are being forced to travel, and some are not even going to their appointments. Labor will re-establish this fund, with $4Â½ million, to get visiting medical specialists to regional and rural areas of Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank Dr John O'Sullivan and all the small businesses across the north-west for helping us collect signatures for this petition I hold. I'm unable to table it because the Petitions Committee has not met, but over 1,000 people in my electorate have signed this petition. We've been campaigning on this for three years. But, again, the budget on Tuesday night did not fund this service. This government has no care or respect for those in regional Australia, particularly in regional Tasmania, and doesn't care about making sure that they get the best care outcomes possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr O'Sullivan said recently:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We had a great service, with cardiologists, physicians and psychiatrists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They were on site to be able to look after our patients but now these patients have to travel for some of their care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have an elderly population and patients who are unwell. They need access to ready medical care in rural areas and should not have to travel 60kms or 100kms for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has failed again. But the choice is clear. Labor will invest in health. Labor will be there to support our farmers.</span>

For the first time in 12 years the budget is back in black and Australia is back on track, and our country is far stronger than it was when we came to government six years ago.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr IRONS:</span>
                  </a>  I hear the opposition cheering over there! By restoring our nation's finances and strengthening our economy, we're able to invest in a significant new skills and infrastructure agenda and continue to deliver essential services Australians rely on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to update the House with a few of the exciting projects that will be happening in my electorate of SwanâI'm sure the member for Hunter can't wait to hear! It was a pleasure to host the Prime Minister last week in my electorate of Swan, where he announced that the Morrison Liberal government 2019-20 federal budget would lock in an additional $1.6 billion investment for critical infrastructure across Perth and regional Western Australia. Of that, I secured $207.5 million for the removal of three key level crossings at Oats Street, Welshpool Road and Mint Street, and a further $13.25 million for the Abernethy Road upgrade in High Wycombe. The replacement of these three key level crossings in Swan will change the way we move around our city and benefit the entire community. I know that constituents of mine who have to sit for 10 or 15 minutes at a railway crossing will be very pleased about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has provided the money, and the state will do the work. This is real money in a real budget that will help many people in Swan get home to their families quicker and safer. You might not enjoy this, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinouâor you might but you won't be surprisedâbut what Bill Shorten and his candidate decided to do the next day was announce that, if elected, they will match the commitment. But, of course, that's only if Bill's candidate is elected. Did they miss the announcement? It's already funded, it's already in the budget, it's real money, but they're going out and announcing it the next day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor always love to boast that they care for hospitals and that they're the ones to trust on health. But as I've always said in this House: don't believe what they say; look at what they do. I assure you that there is a stark contrast. The WA Labor government don't support Bentley Hospital in my electorate of Swan. They started their attacks when I was first elected in 2007 and ramped them back up in 2017 when they came into government. When Jim McGinty was the state health minister in 2007, he attempted to close down the maternity services for Bentley Hospital. Under the leadership of the WA Liberals, we stopped Labor's campaign to undermine one of the key services offered at Bentley Hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't end there, though. Following the WA Labor government's 2017 budget, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Southern Gazette</span> reported, in September 2017:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ten million dollars earmarked for the redevelopment of Bentley Hospital was quietly passed to Royal Perth Hospital's fire needs in the recent State Budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They took $10 million out of Bentley Hospital. Guess what happened recently? It's one of the oldest hospitals in Perth's south, it's still in operation, but Labor believed it wasn't important, so they cut $10 million. Conveniently, Bill Shorten's candidate was in the Premier's office at the time as an adviser during the preparation of this budget that decided that Bentley Hospital did not need an upgrade. But now the Leader of the Opposition's candidate and Labor have attempted to hide their cuts to Bentley Hospital, and Bill Shorten has come over to announceâwait for itâ$10 million with his candidate for Swan.</span>
              </p>

                  </a>  They don't want to hear this, because it's a contrast. WA Labor take $10 million out of the operating budget, and then the Leader of the Opposition comes over and announces it like it is new. How hypocritical! I hope you're keeping up. If you are, you would have worked out that Labor has done absolutely nothing for the hospital except return the initial funding that it cut in the first place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Liberals, as the Treasurer announced, we are back in the black, and we will stay that way. Western Australians know that when the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer come to WA they will be in their back pocket quicker than they can say, 'Tax and spend.' The people of Swan are far smarter than the Leader of the Opposition and his candidates take them for. It's disappointing that they're pulling political stunts like this with hospitals in my electorate of Swan. I've said it once and I'll say it again: when Labor run out of money, they come after your money. Under the Liberals, as the Treasurer announced, we are now back in the black.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FITZGIBBON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  Very sadly, the most common source of complaint to my busy electorate office is the National Disability Insurance Scheme. People with disability, their carers, their families and their loved ones are usually at their wits end when they come to us. These typically self-sufficient people don't really want to come to their member of parliament but are forced to do so out of sheer frustration and their inability to get the service, care and equipment that they need for their loved one or, indeed, for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I get it. I think more than 600,000 Australians are making the transition from the old system to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It's a big exercise. There were always going to be challenges, including teething problems, but we could never have feared that the system could let people down so badly. Like our Centrelink staff, who are also under-resourced, NDIA staff are copping much of the brunt of people's frustration, and they shouldn't be. I have the highest regard for the agency staff. They are doing their best in very difficult circumstances, circumstances driven in large part by the staffing cap that this government has placed on the agency. They're trying to do a very difficult and challenging task in the most challenging of circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I shouldn't be surprised that so many people are coming into my office, because something like 77,000 fewer people have made their way to the NDIS than should have been the case. That's a lot of people. Obviously each of the 150 members of the House of Representatives have their share of those 77,000 people. You can imagine how distressed those people and their families were to learn on Tuesday night that the Prime Minister built his wafer-thin budget surplus in part on the back of their pain. He funded his surplus by underspending on the NDIS. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister say, 'But it's demand driven.' Yes, it is, and 77,000 people aren't placing any demand on the system because they can't get into the system. What an outrageous thing for a government to do. Does it have no conscience, heart or care for these people? It's very disappointing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an opposition we don't pretend that this mess is going to be easy to fix. We have to be careful about expectations management as well, because what we will inherit will be somewhat of a train wreck. We do make the commitment that we will remove that cap, and that in itself will make a big difference. We will work as hard as we can for these people to fix their problems. We will make this an absolute priority for a Shorten Labor government. Why shouldn't it be a priority? Surely there's no greater responsibility than for us to take care of those less advantaged than we are. Certainly there's no group of people in our community more worthy of support than those who are finding themselves frustrated by the National Disability Insurance Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind people that the budget surplus is around $7 billion. You have to be careful suggesting that $1 billion is not a lot of moneyâof course it isâbut, in federal government budget terms, it is not that much more than this government is spending on giving cash rebates on dividend imputation for people in this country who don't pay tax. Of course 80 per cent of that money is going to 20 per cent of the highest-income earners in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where are the government's priorities? Are we that concerned about people getting a tax rebate when they don't pay tax? Or are we more concerned about the people in this country, their carers, their families and their service providers, who are as frustrated as those with disabilities themselves? Where are our priorities? Our priorities should be with those with a disability and all those other people suffering disadvantage in our communities, including those on Newstart. Those on that side like to demonise people on Newstart as if it's somehow always their fault. Sure, there are people who could try harder, but there are more people who, for whatever reason and through no fault of their own, have struggled to get work in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  I appreciate this opportunityâmy last opportunity to speak in this parliament. Upon reflection, we have been a good government. We have returned the budget to surplus. We inherited a budget deep in deficit and we have turned that around. We have the budget back in surplus. We have seen the creation under this government of 1.2 million new jobs, a number that was laughed at when we first suggested a million new jobs. We have unemployment under five per centâwith a four in front of itâa tremendous achievement. The AAA credit rating has been maintained. We have stopped the boats, there have been no further deaths at sea, and we have been able to increase our humanitarian refugee intake from places like Syria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet I look at the possibility of the alternative Labor government and I am frightened for the future of our nation. We have Labor's housing tax, which will slash house prices in electorates across the nation. In my electorate, those who own a house are likely to see a $100,000 devaluation of their homes. We see their attack on self-funded retirees on modest incomesâa discriminatory, regressive tax that slugs those people that have saved and worked under the rules of the day, only to find in their old age that the Labor Party wants to move the goalposts and steal their franking credits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, we have the report from Brian Fisher of BAEconomicsâtruly independent modelling from Brian Fisher, who used to be employed by the Keating government and the Hawke government. Labor's 45 per cent emissions reduction target that they brag about will cost this nation 336,000 full-time jobs. We'll be able to fill up the MCG three times with the number of people that Labor's policies will put in the unemployment lines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the slash for those that still have jobsâan eight per cent cut in real wages across the board. The opposition leader said this should be a referendum about wages. I say, 'Bring it on!' because he is taking to this election policies that will slash wages by eight per cent. For the average wage earner, by 2030 that will be something like $9,000.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have Labor's policy on electricity. The modelling tells us that it'll increase the wholesale price of electricity by up to 58 per cent. We already have some of the highest electricity prices in the world. The Labor Party's policy will see a de-industrialisation of this nation if they proceed with those reckless and wanton targets.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my greatest concerns about what the Labor Party's policies will do if they're elected is about motoring and the freedom of people to own and purchase the type of car that they would like to buy. We have seen this absurd stunt of talking about electric cars.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Electric cars are nothing other than expensive green toys for rich virtue-signalling people. If someone wants to buy an electric car, good luck to them, but they should not come with their hand out asking for a government subsidy and asking governments to assist them. This morning we saw how absolutely clueless the Leader of the Opposition is in this area. He was asked how long it takes to charge an electric car. After a long pause, he said something along the lines of, 'Oh, um, ah, it depends onâit can take eight to 10 minutes.' This shows how completely clueless he is and that he is not across his brief. The time to charge a Nissan Leaf at home from 0 to full on a three-pin plug is 18 hours! On a special 3.7-kilowatt plug, it is 11 hours. Even on the so-called fast charge, it is six hours. A Tesla Model S charged at home takes 44 hours to charge! We have had the Leader of the Opposition out there today saying it will take eight to 10 minutes! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  As the 45th Parliament draws to a close, I'm reflecting on what the government has done for the people of Werriwa. The answer is not much, and not much for the NDIS in particular. This government has woefully underspent. It has let down recipients and carers alike. Many of my constituents have been left suffering, waiting 12 months for plan reviews. The stories that I hear in my electorate are heartbreaking, as were those detailed by the member for Hunter. This should not be happening to provide a surplus. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not much has changed about the NBN either. Much of Werriwa is still waiting for the NBN, and those who have actually got it would like it to work even when it rains! Some parts of my electorate, like Long Point, which I've spoken about in this House on several occasions, won't see it for another 12 monthsâalthough, given that every time that we check the website, that date seems to move back, 12 months may also be a pipedream. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is not much for Western Sydney Airport. Werriwa is home to Sydney's new airport, but we don't know if this government will deliver the road, rail and fuel line needs  for the promised economic boom. There is also not much for education. School and TAFEs, which promise opportunity for the people of my electorate, are being left to stagnate by this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we get to energy billsâthey have never been higher. Residents of Werriwa are feeling the squeeze of the cost of living and the lack of energy policy that is leading to the uncertainty that is keeping power bills high. Werriwa's had enough. We need a Labor government to deliver the health care, education and infrastructure our community deserves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Buongiorno! Last month I attended the beginners Italian class at Marco Polo Italian School. The school is hosted by CNA-Italian Australian Services. My electorate of Werriwa has a large Italian community. When I speak to my constituents, they're concerned about their children and grandchildren maintaining a connection to their culture and their language. While visiting CNA, I spoke to some of the HSC students learning Italian. These young people highlighted how important it was for them to continue learning the language of their grandparents, so they can connect to them and their cultural heritage. Money is tight at CNA and other language schools in Werriwa, but they still do their best to deliver services to as many of our citizens as possible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why Labor's $8 million investment in community language schools is so important. We want our young citizens in a diverse and multicultural Australia to have an affordable way to connect with their language and their culture. We want our young people to be able to communicate with their grandparents and their relatives, and be part of our global economy. Under our plan, the not-for profit language schools will be able to apply for grants of up to $25,000 to upgrade resources, improve teacher training and expand their programs to preschool-age children. Having seen the CNA school, I know just how much difference this money will make, and I look forward to community language schools flourishing under a Shorten Labor government. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In February I visited John Edmondson High School in Horningsea Park for a very special ceremony. Together with Principal Leon Weatherstone, I unveiled a plaque commemorating the support of the Edmondson, Hurst and Peacock families during both World War I and World War II. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We think of World War I as the time when Australia became a nation in her own right. Whilst the Gallipoli campaign was catastrophic, it brought Australians together to share in the bravery and sacrifice of our own soldiers and those of New Zealand across the Ditch. We know both wars are significant in terms of Australian history and world history, but something we reflect less on is the individual sacrifices and the impact those sacrifices had on families and communities back home. John Edmondson, whom the high school is named for, died when he was 27, on the battlefields in Tobruk. While we rightly commemorate the bravery and sacrifice of John Edmondson himself, what we often forget to consider is the grief of his family and the grief of the community he left back home in Liverpool. John's parents, Joseph and Maude, had to wave goodbye to a son they would never see again. John was their only child. This story was common among countless families who bravely supported their children to fight for their country and whose children never returned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The plaque was funded under the Armistice Centenary Grants Program. These grants enable community organisations to commemorate, as part of Australia's military history, the end of World War I, as well as the war's effect on their communities.</span>

In the budget this week, along with the surplus, we announced a record $100 billion over 10 years for roads and rail projects right across the country, in our rural areas and in our cities. This includes $2 billion to finally get fast rail going in this nation, from Geelong to Melbourne, to deliver a 32-minute journey. As soon as the state government can match this fundingâwe're calling on the state government to match this fundingâand is willing to build this rail line, the money will be there. It is in our budget on page 64 of Budget Paper No. 2, and the reference is from 2021-22: $2 billion for the delivery of fast rail from Melbourne to Geelong to reduce travel times, increase train patronage and ease congestion on the Princes Highway and West Gate Bridge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also delivered $700 million more for the Geelong rail duplication project, a project that I have championed since 2015. In 2016, we delivered $1 million for planning at a time when the Minister for Transport Infrastructure, Jacinta Allan, said this was not a priority. In the 2017 budget, there was $100 million; in the 2018 budget, there was $50 million; and now, of course, there is $700 million, bringing it to a total of $850 million for this project. There's also money for a business case to look at the Geelong rail tunnel, and additional money left over for the provision of future construction works to deliver that dual track that we desperately need to provide more frequent, reliable and faster rail services through Geelong. We know how critical rail infrastructure is.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What an absolute joke that is. That is a patent lie. As I've documented very clearly, we've delivered $150 million already, and now, in this budget, which preceded this candidate making this statement, we are delivering another $700 million. Of course, just two weeks ago we announced $2 billion. So, what a mockery! Politics is full of people who come to politics for all the right reasons, but Australians want their politicians to have integrity, and there is no integrity when a candidate makes that sort of statement after our government has delivered this sort of money for the Corangamite region. Of course, the total amount of money available and announced by our government up until the budget was $1.75 billion for the Regional Rail Revival package, when the state Labor government had provided only $150 million.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we have the member for Corio making more untruthful statements, claiming that the $2 billion for fast rail is not in the budget. That is patently untrue. They are desperate. It is clear that the Labor Party does not support fast rail. The Labor Party does not support faster, more reliable rail services into our region. The member for Corio is on a mission to campaign against better rail services. I say to the member for Corio: shame on you. We are incredibly proud of our commitment to fast rail. I call him out on his statements, which are completely untruthful, and I call on the Victorian government to provide the $2 billion in matching funding that we need to get on with this project; to expedite the $50 million that it's allocated in its business plan for fast rail; and to bring forward the construction timetable of the rail duplication project so we can get on with this project.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr Robert:</span>
                  </a>  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) In 2018, Scamwatch received 27,110 reports of scams with losses of $9.0 million in which the reporter mentioned a telecommunications provider. Of these reports, 7,731 (29 per cent) were reported by those over 65 years old, with $4.3 million lost. These reports include those that mention Telstra, Optus, Vodafone, NBN, and Broadband. 'Telecommunications scams' can also include those where a scammer used a telecommunications network to contact a victim. In 2018, Scamwatch received 83,247 reports of scams with losses of $30.3 million in which the reporter was contacted using a telecommunications network. Of these reports, 13,726 (16 per cent) were reported by those over 65 years old, with $7.7 million lost. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Scamwatch reports do not indicate any specific targeting of a particular age group, but instead suggest scammers attempt to make contact with as many potential victims as possible via a range of communications mediums. Overall in 2018, the age group that lost the most money was those aged 55-64 years old with $24.9 million lost. However this is likely due to a number of factors rather than the age group being specifically targeted by scammers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The ACCC's scam education strategy involves a mixed media and engagement approach including digital communication, appearances on popular radio and television programmes by ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard and monthly media releases to encourage coverage by traditional media.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ACCC has also conducted a number of targeted communication campaigns aimed at helping older Australians. Each year the ACCC coordinates the Scams Awareness Week (formerly 'Consumer Fraud Awareness Week'). This annual communication campaign is aimed at educating Australians about current scam trends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ACCC also produces and promotes a hard copy resource about scams called the Little Black Book of Scams, so that those who are not online have access to some information about common scams.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In 2018 the ACCC released a number of resources to educate aged care recipients in the home care sector about their consumer rights. These resources included a scam warning as it offered a unique opportunity to reach older Australians. The ACCC has distributed over  60,000 of the printed consumer brochures.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Status Resolution Officers (SROs â formerly known as case managers) work with detainees to assist them in resolving their immigration status in a fully-informed manner consistent with legislation and government policy. SROs are alert to issues which may impede status resolution and engage with relevant stakeholders and service providers to remove or reduce barriers to achieving an immigration outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">SROs do not advocate for a particular immigration outcome on behalf of a person or actively service a person's needs. The role of an SRO is one of stewardship, ensuring coordination and oversight of appropriate services and that all parties are working collaboratively towards the objectives of the status resolution program.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The number of SROs required to manage cases in detention varies due to the composition of the detainee population at any given time. Factors include the number of detainees, reasons for detention, location of detainees and complexity of individual cases. SROs also manage cases in the community (residence determination) in addition to the held detention caseload. The number of cases allocated to each SRP is dependent on a number of factors, including complexity of individual cases, vulnerabilities identified and the status resolution pathway for each individual detainee. Generally caseloads can vary between 15-30 detainees per SRO. SROs meet with their clients on a regular basis â either monthly or quarterly, depending on the determined level of support required.</span>

The Facilities and Detainee Service Provider (FDSP's) staffing resources across the immigration detention network are based on projected detainee populations supplied by the Department for threeâmonth future periods. As such, the FDSP is given sufficient notice to provide adequate staffing resources to meet their contractual obligations in providing services under the Contract. Within this framework, it is a matter for the FDSP to decide how to utilise their staffing resources at the facilities to ensure that services are being delivered in accordance with the Contract</span>
