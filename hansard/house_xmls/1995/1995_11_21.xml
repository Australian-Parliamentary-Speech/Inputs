        The amendment to the ANL Sale Bill 1995 made in the Senate sets a cap on the expenditure that may be appropriated for the purpose of clause 67(2). This clause appropriates money which may be necessary to meet the needs for working capital of any Commonwealth company that is to hold assets, rights, liabilities and obligations transferred out of ANL prior to its sale to P&amp;O in accordance with the draft sale agreement.

         The amendment was moved by the government in the Senate to meet concerns that this appropriation was unlimited. In fact, the original appropriation was only to be available to provide working capital for the 1995-96 financial year. But the government is prepared to set an upper limit of $1 million on the amounts that may be appropriated for this purpose. The amendment inserts into clause 67 section 2A, which sets a ceiling of $1 million on the amount that may be provided under clause 67(2). I commend the amendment.

         —I was very pleased to see the amendment moved. I addressed the question of that appropriation together with the other much larger appropriation of $15 million during my speech on the second reading debate and in consideration in detail. We had many concerns about both appropriations. I was pleased to get an early undertaking in the open parliament concerning this $1 million limit being placed. The $15 million, which was of far more concern, was then subject to undertakings given to me by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) personally on the eve of the Senate hearing. On that basis, the bill has been agreed to. I am pleased to see this amendment now.

        The Family Law Reform Bill 1994 passed this House on 9 November 1994. One year and five days later the bill passed the other place with 95 amendments, to which this House's agreement is now sought. The majority of these amendments were moved by the government following further consultation which occurred during that time. All government amendments were accepted by the other place.

         The most significant feature of the bill is the changed approach to children in the new part VII of the Family Law Act. I am pleased that both here and in the other place speakers in the debate have enthusiastically supported the new approach. The bill provides for principles on which the new part VII is based, including the child's right to know and be cared for by both parents and to have contact with both parents and with other people significant to his or her care, welfare and development.

         The government proposed an amendment to provide a best interests qualification to the principle recognising the child's right to contact with both parents. However, the government accepts that qualification of all the principles underlying the part by reference to the best interests of the child may assist in strengthening the message to parents that they cannot seek to subvert these principles to argue for their own rights rather than those of their children. The government, therefore, supported in the other place an amendment to provide this qualification to all the principles. As amended, the principles therefore establish a presumption of shared responsibility by parents for caring for their children. This sharing of responsibility can only be altered by agreement between the parents or by the court if it is not in the best interests of the child.

         The original intention of the late Senator Murphy was that the Family Law Act would create a rebuttable presumption of shared parenting, but over the years the Family Court has chosen to largely ignore that. It is hoped that these reforms will now call for much closer attention to this presumption and that the Family Court will give full and proper effect to the intention of the parliament.

         One amendment which I particularly commend to the House is the amendment of section 69C, which deals with applications to the court in children's matters. This section will now include a specific reference to grandparents as persons who may apply for orders in relation to children. Grandparents are in some cases the major point of stability for children during the breakdown of their parents' relationship. While grandparents are able to make application under the current provisions, and have done so, this express reference to grandparents will reinforce the bill's message to parents that they must focus on what is best for their children by including grandparents and other members of the extended family important to the children when they are settling arrangements for the care of children.

         The amendments strengthen the requirement upon the Family Court generally to make orders which are consistent with any family violence orders and to ensure that the terms of its orders do not expose people to risk of family violence. The encouragement of the use of primary dispute resolution processes is tempered by a more overt recognition that these processes are not always appropriate.

         The bill lists the factors that the court must take into account in determining the best interests of the child. These factors are expanded by a number of amendments. One of the government amendments requires consideration of any need to maintain a connection with Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders. In addition, a new paragraph has been inserted to require the court to consider the practicalities of contact and whether there are practical difficulties and expense which will affect the child's right to have contact with both parents. The government will accept this amendment which may be of assistance in ensuring that full consideration is given to the effects of, for example, parents living a long way apart. Another amendment which improves the bill ensures that the best interests of the child are given paramount consideration by the court, regardless of whether or not an order is made by consent, and that the court is provided with a discretion in the case of consent orders as to the factors which are to be taken into account.

         A significant feature of the new part VII is parenting plans. The purpose of these provisions is to encourage parents to agree together, or with assistance from a counsellor or mediator, on matters affecting children rather than to have them judicially determined. Again, parents are directed to give the best interests of the child paramount consideration in working out their agreed plan.

         The government believes that the requirements of a parenting plan should simply be that it be in writing and that it be made between the parents. In general, a parenting plan corresponds with a parenting order. Accordingly, it may deal with child residence, contact or maintenance or any other relevant issue. We recognise that parents should be able to make decisions on such issues without interference from external sources. However, registration with the court is necessary if the agreement is to be enforceable.

         Unfortunately, consideration of this matter in the other place has led to significantly increased formality and cost in registration.

         —The amendments to the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 which are before us arise as a result of very detailed consideration by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. We do not oppose the broad principles of this bill. We did have a number of concerns about it. The bill deals with a number of issues relating to mediation and children. It contains some philosophical changes relating to custody and, in particular, access. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) has dealt with those matters. As I understand it, the Senate committee produced two reports. There are still some matters relating to a separate bill—the Family Law Reform Bill (No. 2) 1994—which need consideration, but my comments relate to the Family Law Reform Bill 1994.

         I observe that there has always been a very healthy interest in family law matters in this parliament. I was here when the Family Law Act was first enacted. The parliament debated the contents of that bill over a very much longer period than we would normally see accorded to legislation today. Interestingly enough, in relation to those deliberations, there were views expressed across the normal partisan party political boundaries.

         What interests me here is that it is only one house of this parliament that is devoting itself to consideration of important issues on which I think members of this House equally have a view. We are going to adopt amendments today—the opposition will not be opposing the proposals that have come forward from the Senate any more than the government has—in order to get the bill, and there will be some compromises. But the fact is that those compromises are being formed and determined in another chamber involving our colleagues, who obviously would be approached on these matters by their constituents within the states they represent. But I would hazard a guess that they are probably not as frequently approached by constituents anguished about the Family Law Act and its operations as we in this chamber are.

         The matters I will discuss relate to the parenting plans, the imprisonment of registrars, family violence and grandparents. The most notable failure of the government was its difficulty with the implementation of committee recommendations with respect to parenting plans. The parliamentary secretary foreshadowed concerns about the complexity. These parenting plans do deal with welfare of children, residents, contacts and schooling matters—a whole host of issues in which parties do try to reach some agreement.

         It was an issue in which the role of the Family Court with respect to parenting plans was going to have to be addressed. Parenting plans as registered can become orders of the court. At present there are, I understand, 1,000 such agreements, compared with something of the order of 100,000 consent orders in 1993-94.

         The Law Council did raise some concerns with the committee about the lack of scrutiny of parenting plans. They were not to be examined by the court to ensure that the best interests of the child were addressed. The Law Council suggested that there should be a level of what they call minimal scrutiny, such as a form 12A procedure that is already in place in relation to court orders on other matters, such as property, which often seem to be more important than children. The concern of cost was raised, but the Law Council submitted that that procedure was not expensive.

         In respect of parenting plans, while the Chief Justice of the Family Court indicated that he did not think it was really necessary, he also indicated that he would have no objection to a registrar being required to scrutinise the parenting plans. So the committee recommended that the Family Court monitor parenting plans when filed within the registry and that a court ought to be able to make orders specifying information required to be addressed in the plan. The government rejected this approach on the basis that scrutiny would defeat the intention of this bill to facilitate greater use of non-litigious methods of settlement.

         We accordingly proposed an amendment in the Senate following negotiations with the Australian Democrats and the government and the Senate then sought to have passed these amendments to the parenting plan provisions. The amendment requires that, before a parenting plan is registered, the parties must either have received independent advice or have developed the plan in consultation with a family or child counsellor. In addition, the amendment requires that, for registration, the plan must be accompanied by certain information that will be prescribed by the rules of the court. In determining whether to register the plan, the court must have regard, in addition to the plan itself, to the information accompanying the plan. The intention is that there be a checklist of factors for consideration by the court to highlight to the court potential problems with the plan.

         The issue of imprisonment of registrars was of interest to me. I thought it rather interesting that registrars could be subjected to imprisonment. The first committee report recommended that that provision be deleted. The government rejected this recommendation. The coalition believes it is not appropriate that registrars be subjected to the penalty of imprisonment and, accordingly, we supported an amendment from the Greens (WA) to substitute for the imprisonment penalty a financial penalty of up to $12,000.

         In the second round of committee hearings family violence was a significant issue of concern in relation to a lack of focus in the bill on family violence and violence against women in particular. The National Women's Justice Coalition has been at the forefront of expressing these concerns. That coalition makes the point that the legislation, on its face, does not give nearly enough focus to issues of family violence. The concerns extend to all aspects of the bill and focus on primary dispute resolution and parenting plans, amongst others.

         One suggestion, however, was not accepted by the government but was moved as an amendment that, on balance, we supported.

Section 43 sets out the principles to be applied by the court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under the act. The amendment specifically includes a reference to the need to ensure safety from family violence. That amendment was endorsed by the Family Law Council and the family law section of the Law Council of Australia.

         Finally, in relation to grandparents, and amendment No. 73, during the committee hearings a number of grandparents organisations strongly argued that the act should make specific reference to the rights of grandparents. They do play a vital role in the lives of their grandchildren. That role can be particularly important at a time of breakdown. To the extent that the bill helps facilitate agreement between parents in relation to their children, it is hoped that it will also facilitate agreement with respect to contact with grandparents.

         The bill before the parliament gives neither parents nor any other persons rights in relation to children. The bill looks at what is in the best interests of the child.

         The coalition supports the thrust of the bill in this respect. The legislative scheme facilitates, either by agreement or court order, contact or residence arrangements that are in the child's best interests. That will be best served often by regular contact with grandparents and, in some cases, by the child living with the grandparents. The bill allows persons concerned with day-to-day care, welfare and development of the child to apply for parenting orders in relation to children, and this will give most grandparents standing to be heard before the court.

         Although grandparents will have standing in fact, grandparents organisations wanted specific reference to grandparents in the bill. The committee recommended the government consider including grandparents in the standing provision, section 69C. In its response to the committee recommendations in this respect, the government indicated an amendment would not be appropriate because grandparents already have standing under the broadly worded provision. Subsequently, however, the government did agree to introduce an amendment to specifically refer to grandparents in the standing provision, and the coalition is happy to support this amendment which recognises that grandparents do play a significant role in children's lives.

         —I rise to support the remarks of the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) in relation to the amendments that are being moved to the Family Law Reform Bill. At the outset, can I also endorse his comments in relation to the role of this chamber in relation to legislation. All too often we see legislation brought back to this House amended in ways that have been suggested in this House after committee consideration in the Senate. The intransigence of the government in refusing to refer bills to committees or to invite the attention of House committees to legislation is to be deplored. We are all too often saved by the Senate, and it does this House no credit that that occurs.

         There are just two amendments to the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 to which I want to make special reference, and then I will refer to another matter. They relate, firstly, to the need to ensure safety from domestic or family violence and, secondly, to the formal recognition of the significant role played by grandparents in their grandchildren's lives.

         During the hearings before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee there was significant concern expressed about the failure of government to legislate in relation to violence within the family. As indicated by the honourable member for Berowra, the principal proponent of these views was the National Women's Justice Coalition. As a result of the concerns expressed by the NWJC, the committee made a number of recommendations that included the provision of positive safeguards to protect the parties from family violence. Amendments incorporating most of these recommendations were moved by the government in the Senate and supported by the coalition.

         One suggestion made by the NWJC was moved as an amendment by the Australian Democrats and carried with the support of the coalition, despite the government's opposition. This is an amendment to the section of the Family Law Act that sets out the principles to be applied by the courts in the exercise of their jurisdiction under the act. The Democrat amendment adds a principle in terms of the need to ensure safety from family violence. This amendment was endorsed by both the Family Law Council and the Law Council of Australia. While it is only a small step in dealing with an extremely difficult but widespread problem, it is hoped that the attention of the court will be more directly focused upon family violence as a problem.

         In relation to grandparents, there has been a lot of pressure from groups representing them to amend the act to include a specific reference to the rights of grandparents in relation to the children of a marriage. In the second reading debate on 8 November last year, I commented on parenting plans by referring to grandparents. I indicated:

        It is the right of the child to have the continuing involvement of both parents in the child's care and upbringing. It is a pleasing reform that this is expressly recognised in the bill. There can be no doubt that it is a great advantage to a child to have the love and care of both parents and, through them, involvement with the parents' respective families—the grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.
       </para>
       <para>
        Amendment No. 73 deals with grandparents explicitly. The bill states that the principle underlying the object of what is best for the child is that `children have a right of contact, on a regular basis, with both their parents and with other people significant to their care, welfare and development'. Grandparents, of course, will fall into this category.

         The committee dealt with this issue, and, as indicated by the member for Berowra, the government opposed as inappropriate an amendment that would have given specific reference to the grandparents, the argument being that the grandparents already have standing under the broadly worded provision. Subsequently, however, the government did agree to introduce an amendment to specifically refer to grandparents in the standing provision. I for one am very happy to support this because it gives greater recognition to the significant role that grandparents play in children's lives.

         A child's concept of who the child is and its esteem can be very significantly influenced by its being the focus of attention of relatives. In this respect, grandparents can be very important. I believe this amendment will assist in ensuring that a child maintains contact with its grandparents, aunts, uncles and others, even if the marriage between the parents has entirely broken down.

         A further matter to which I wish to refer relates, in effect, to children's rights. In a recent decision, the full court of the Family Court of Australia referred to a number of circumstances—there were 14, from memory—in which it is appropriate that a child be separately represented before the court in proceedings relating to the family of which the child is a member. This is a very important decision. It means that there is a greater recognition, within the unfortunately litigious process by which families' breakdowns are resolved, of the interest of the child being quite separate in many ways from those of either or both parents.

         While the decision is to be applauded in that respect, it is not without its practical consequences. I recently met with the directors of the various legal aid and legal services commissions when they were meeting in Perth and in Margaret River. An informal estimate by the directors of the cost to legal aid alone for representation of children in Family Court proceedings is about $6 million to $7 million per annum. In the context of very tight legal aid budgets, that represents a very significant proportion of the total funding provided by the Commonwealth in respect of what is a Commonwealth matter.

         Obviously, given the already sparing allocation of legal aid to those seeking legal aid for the purposes of their own proceedings, not all of the needs of the children are going to be met in cases where it is appropriate. This is something that needs very close attention from the government, just as the question of the cost of representation of those accused of serious criminal offences needed attention following the decision of the High Court in the case of Dietrich.

         I support the amendments proposed by the government. It is a matter of regret that the government did not suggest that this bill be referred to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues for consideration. Instead, it was dealt with by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. In future with any such legislation which is of great concern across the community and to all members across all parties, I urge the government to consider that it be referred to a House committee in the first instance.

         —I want to make a couple of brief points particularly with regard to amendment No. 73, which is the inclusion of the recognition of grandparents and their role in the domestic situation of family break-up. The reason I want to do this is that one of my constituents, Mrs Di Underwood, has made this her personal crusade over the last 12 months with a number of different organisations across Australia. It was born out of her particular and individual experience with her own son and grandchild and the access that they have been denied and that they believe is necessary for the balanced upbringing of that child.

         Since I have maintained a close contact with Di over the last 12 months she has certainly brought to the fore a very unnerving sort of relevance to this issue as far as the depth and breadth of this problem within society is concerned. I do not think there would be anybody in this House or in the other place who would not at some point in their extended family have encountered this situation and I believe it has probably touched every extended family in Australia.

         So it is with great import that these amendments come back to the House of Representatives—as I think a previous speaker indicated, some 12 months or more after the Family Law Reform Bill passed through this place and went to the Senate—and are being supported by the coalition, in particular amendment No. 73 which, as I have said, is particularly important.

They have done an important job, particularly in lobbying a lot of the senators who have been involved in the process of developing these amendments.

         —in reply—I just want to close the debate by making a couple of comments. Firstly, I listened with interest to the comments made by a couple of members about their concerns about having proper debate of important bills like this bill, the Family Law Reform Bill, with suitable approaches for amendments and the like. From my point of view, whenever people have raised reasonable amendments with me I have always taken them into account, and I will continue to do so.

         The other point I want to make is in relation to the issue of parenting plans being not only lodged with the court but also scrutinised by the court. I would simply make the point that, whilst the government has accepted this amendment—the large proportion of children who are not in any way subjected to the Family Court may be 80 or 90 per cent of children—society, of course, does not seek in any way to scrutinise the parenting arrangements between their parents. I simply think that we have injected a degree of bureaucracy into the parenting plan arrangements for no valid purpose.

         That is a tragedy because it may be that the parenting plan arrangements for which many people hold high hopes will not be as effective as they might otherwise have been. I think registering them with the court is entirely appropriate but, where the two parents have been able to reach an agreement, why we then need the court to scrutinise them is open to serious doubt. With those few comments, I commend the amendments to the House.

         —When important bills such as the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill we are debating today are introduced with such haste and in such a slapdash manner, it seems only wise to speak later rather than earlier. The government has produced here two weak and complicated pieces of legislation. It should come as no surprise that they have been changed. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill is already significantly different from the draft version that was circulated for discussion. The coalition's campaign against the removal of women under 40 for eligibility for the wife pension scared the government backbench into revolt, forcing changes to the bill.

         The government has also been embarrassed by our foreshadowed amendments to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and announced a package to assist Meridian Investment unit holders—a package, I might add, that is mean-spirited when compared with the coalition's proposals. This bill has already created a great deal of concern over its lack of detail. I trust that the coalition will be able to force a few more changes on it so that the pensioners the legislation affects will enjoy some real certainty, as opposed to the vagueness of what the government is offering.

         I do not want to speak for long today. However, I do want to canvass some of the aspects of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and the extended deeming provisions that have caused the greatest worry for the coalition and the community. The shadow minister, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), has foreshadowed an amendment condemning the government for its cavalier treatment of the House by providing insufficient time for consideration of the detailed provisions of this bill. The amendment goes on to condemn the government for its failure to include details of the timing and regularity of valuation of financial investments under the extended deeming rules; for its failure to adequately warn people affected by these new measures; for its failure to assist investors in Meridian Investment Trust from unfair penalisation under the unrealised capital gains provisions; and, finally, for its failure to properly deal with the potentially adverse impact of extended deeming on the holders of investments in friendly societies. They are all points worth making, and the government should stand condemned on all counts.

         Complex social security law creates difficulties every day for the people who have to administer it and for the people it attempts to assist.

Some of these were truly remarkable, such as the finding that $5 million could be saved if staff spent only five minutes less each day reading instructions. I cannot imagine that today's measures will be the first step to improve this situation. They are a perfect illustration of the way the government has created the problem.

         The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 is not just a slapdash piece of legislation. It is also incomplete. It does not contain all the details necessary to introduce extended deeming. Under the new deeming rules a single pensioner will be deemed to earn a return of five per cent on financial investments worth up to $30,000—$50,000 for couples—and the balance of investments will be deemed to earn seven per cent. The government claims that this system will create certainty as pensioners' payments will not be affected by market volatility as the value of their investments moves up and down.

Pensioners' deeming rates will move up and down with the value of their assets. However, the government will not let us know when these official revaluations are going to occur. It seems appropriate to ask if pensioners will be able to choose if and when they want the value of their investments revised or if revaluation will occur at a time when it will benefit the government.

         It was interesting to find hidden away in the budget papers the government's own estimation that 207,000 pensioners will suffer a decrease in pension if they do not rearrange their assets. As the shadow minister rightly observed, Social Security was able to successfully explain changes to the wife pension to its clients with some clear and helpful letters and brochures. It would have been a simple matter to do the same with this measure to pensioners with shares. If the government intends to propose changes such as these it should have the courtesy to pass on the fullest possible amount of information to the people who will be affected by its final outcome.

         Of course, it should also be noted, when considering the numbers of people affected by this move, that the government did not receive the savings originally anticipated from its treatment of unrealised capital gains. This, presumably, is one of the reasons why the government is moving to a new scheme. The revised budget forecasts that the Treasurer has said will be released some time before Christmas are already expected to show that the government's financial strategy is in tatters. One can only wonder how effective the extended deeming proposals will prove to be.

         The issues of friendly society bonds is another matter for concern coming from the haste in which this legislation has been prepared. The Australian Friendly Societies Association has suggested that prepaid investments such as friendly society bonds should be treated differently from financial products where tax is not prepaid and investors pay tax at their own marginal tax rates. The association has argued that returns from tax prepaid products will necessarily be lower as the tax has been paid before the distribution to investors and that its investors will be unfairly affected by extended deeming. For this reason we believe the Senate community affairs committee should also examine these implications of today's bills.

         I was not here when the original unrealised capital gains and deeming measures were debated, but I quickly learnt from my mail bag and talking with my constituents just how controversial they had been. The coalition has long promised to repeal the unfair unrealised capital gains provisions. We have criticised the government for the way in which pension incomes can alter so much depending on the vagaries of the share market and the uncertainty and hardship that this system can cause. Today's patchy bills, and the review they will need, show that the government still has a lot to learn before it produces something workable.

         I rise to speak in this cognate debate and to expand on some of the comments made by my colleague the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne). I also indicate that the way in which the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill have been introduced raises one's eyebrows. They have been introduced at a time when many people who rely on either the age pension wholly or partly or have their own investments and still qualify for an age pension spend most of their waking hours worrying themselves sick that the government is going to change the rules again and take their pension away.

         As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, would know, we live in constantly changing times. People's perceptions of change are grossly exaggerated at times by the amount of change that appears to be going on around them at any particular time. The types of changes in the bills before us do nothing to reassure those who feel that their lives, their incomes and their opportunities for maintaining their standard of living are under challenge once again.

        These comments arise from the extraordinary scenario created by the introduction of the deeming provisions in the first place. As we know from experience, and having been a campaigner against the way in which these deeming provisions were introduced in the social security legislation, there are instances where they will impact unfairly on one particular group of people who have a particular type of investment.

         We now find that, in order to allegedly simplify these arrangements, the changes have been made whereby the total value of a pensioner's financial investments will be used to calculate his or her income from those investments. A deeming rate of five per cent will apply to the first $30,000 of investments for a single pensioner, or the first $50,000 for couples. Thereafter a deeming rate of seven per cent will apply. Pensioners will receive a full pension where income from financial investments is less than $43,000 for a single pensioner or $75,000 for a couple.

         As the member for Sturt, who has obviously received representations—as I have and as, I imagine, many other members have—has indicated, the friendly societies have indicated some serious concerns with these changes, serious enough to cause their members some disquiet and to be destabilised or to find themselves feeling insecure about their retirement income. I must say, while we have the parliamentary secretary at the table, that this destabilisation, this constant change, has been a feature of government policy throughout its life and it has accelerated in recent times.

The complaints of people or organisations like the friendly societies are reflecting this basic rise in insecurity on the part of people who are pensioners or self-funded retirees.

         The United Ancient Order of Druids have indicated in their letter to me that the present or proposed deeming rates in the bill make no allowance for tax paid investments. In other words, the flat rates are set at five per cent up to 30 per cent, as I said, and seven per cent beyond. They are based on tax unpaid returns provided by banks, building societies, credit unions, et cetera. Investments like safe friendly society bonds are given no chance to compete because they are obliged to pay 33 per cent tax before bonuses are credited to the bond. That is hardly a level playing field in the competition to offer retirement income investments to likely customers.

         Some 400,000 pensioners have about $2.8 billion invested with friendly societies which are asking on behalf of their members why they should be treated unfairly. What they are asking for in this case is a fair go for their members. They have indicated in their submission two ways in which they believe the matter could be resolved. The first is the setting of a tax paid equivalent deeming rate; in other words, five per cent, less 33 per cent, equivalent to 3.35 per cent. The second is giving friendly societies the option to provide their pensioner members with a tax unpaid cash paying bond, leaving the liability for tax in the pensioner's or recipient's hands.

         The societies have asked me—and others—to make representations on their behalf. I am conscious of the fact that there is comment abroad that the friendly societies perhaps ought to be looking at offering other sorts of products to their likely members or their likely customers instead of tax prepaid bonds. That is a fair comment to a certain extent because, in many cases, pensioners are not taxpayers. They are not likely to be paying tax and, therefore, the product may not necessarily be the most suitable in their case. However, as I indicated earlier, we are dealing with people who have made investment decisions for their long-term retirement income in the hope that those decisions will be concrete decisions that will provide them with a fair standard of living throughout their retired lives.

         I will now comment on the income test treatment of Meridian Investment Trust. I refer to the press release of the Minister for Social Security on 25 October. He announces that the government decided to apply concessional income tax treatment to pensioners affected by the failure of Estate Mortgage in 1990. He points out that Global Funds Management took over the funds of the Estate Mortgage group in 1990 and consolidated them into one trust called the Meridian Investment Trust. This trust was listed on the Stock Exchange in December 1993. The listing meant that the trust comes under the rate of return rules for valuing managed investments under social security income tests.

         Until recently, the price of the stock was such that there was little impact on pensions. However, recent increases in the Stock Exchange price are now being reflected in a pension reduction and many of those concerns of the Minister for Social Security. This problem will cease to exist next July when the government's extended deeming measure will replace the rate of return rules. However, given the circumstances of the Estate Mortgage failure in 1990, there are particular features of this situation that justify concessional treatment in the meantime. The minister announced that the government has therefore decided to apply concessional income tax treatment to these investments.

         This is precisely the type of circumstance that many of us predicted in relation to the application of deeming rates in the first place. We have the somewhat invidious position that, where an investment incurs a loss during the particular period of its treatment under the deeming rate rules, there is no provision for the person who may have had a gain in the previous financial year and suffered a loss in the next financial year to get a replacement or transfer of that loss back into their retirement income. Having lost the pension as a consequence of the deemed rise in income under the deeming provisions, that pensioner would not be eligible to claim back or in any way claw back the loss from the performance of their invested income over the next ensuing financial period.

         In relation to Meridian, I make a plea to the minister. The investors who invested with Heine Management have understandably reported on the adverse effects to the social security benefit entitlements of many unit holders in flexi property trust. They have asked the minister for a similar extension of this treatment that Meridian Investments have enjoyed to the people who are flexi unit holders. In other words, it will allow them to obtain a change to the current unreasonable treatment of their unit holders by the DSS.

         One of the changes that has been proposed in the legislation that is before us today is in relation to the pensioner loans system, which is quite a lengthy piece of paperwork. That scheme is a first-rate scheme. Of all the things the government has done in recent times, that is one of the good ones. If the parliamentary secretary has had anything to do with that scheme she ought to be congratulated because it is a scheme that many have found to be most useful. It is a great idea because it allows pensioners to draw down extra income, or perhaps extra funds, from the asset value of their homes.

This scheme allows people to improve their lifestyle using the asset value of their home to take a loan which is not repayable until they pass away. That is a good idea. From time to time, one can congratulate the government for good ideas. They are entitled to accept the congratulations of those who have taken advantage of it.

Her husband suffered from chronic Alzheimer's disease and needed 24-hour supervision. Neither Mrs S nor her family wanted to send Mr S, the person suffering from the disease, to a nursing home or a big town. Mrs S is eligible for a carers pension, but she cannot cope with her husband's needs all the time. They looked around for somebody who would be prepared to come to Wiluna, which is where they live, to help care for Mr S. After four or five tries, they found a woman who was suitable and who wanted to stay in this remote location and help. Unfortunately, she was on a working visa, which meant that she could not hold down a job for more than three months at a time. To make matters worse, Mrs S could not claim a carers pension or benefit for the carer who was willing to go there because the CES required that they advertise Australia-wide to ensure that no other Australians were available to take the job. Of course, that would have required tremendous effort and would have taken many months.

         In listening to the contributions of those opposite to this debate in the House, I noted that one of the points that kept coming out time and time again was the eight days for consideration of this bill in detail. When the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) got up and made his first contribution to this debate, he mentioned the eight days for consideration in detail of the bill, as did every other opposition member who followed him thereafter. I thought that was quite extraordinary. With all due respect, it got to the stage where I thought that someone had written a speech and then distributed it around. We indicated what we were going to do during the May budget. I do not know how many more months we need to do that.

Yet I find that the original one that was circulated has amendments and changes to it. So we cannot have it both ways. Obviously, he had been given an opportunity to look at the information, along with all other opposition members, but then he came back and said that eight days was not enough. I really think that was a bit of a furphy. Those opposite should have commended and congratulated the government on the number of steps that it has taken in respect of the bills before the House to make sure that what we do is at all times give account and consideration to the people whom we want to benefit from it—that is, the pensioners and those who are disadvantaged within our society.

         There are a couple of other points that I would like to raise. One of the criticisms, if I could put it that way, of the opposition, which was again mentioned in a repetitive style, related to deeming. Just about every opposition speaker got up and condemned deeming. I do not know whether they condemned it because they do not understand it or because they just wanted to make political points from it. Obviously, if they condemned it from a political point of view, they did not give any consideration to the comments of many pensioners within our society and organisations far and wide who have commended and congratulated the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and the government on the steps that have now been taken in the simplification of deeming.

         Others are saying, `It is some new invention.' I think one of the opposition spokespersons said, `Why have we got to have it and what are we doing with it?' We have called it extended deeming because we are building on what is already in place. In so doing, we have simplified it. We have been circulating that message to all pensioners and pension organisations for something like five months now and we will continue to do so with information going out through our pensioner newsletters and also other methods of circulation, particularly

         I was leading up to a couple of points on deeming. Why has the government done it? This is the ongoing point made by the opposition. We did it because we had been approached by many organisations—our pensioner income and assets test review came out of that—and people saying, `We want a deeming approach, and it is certainly preferable.' We had that reviewed and it has come into being because it is simpler. It replaces the numerous rules that originally applied to different financial assets with one set of rules. That makes it easier for people to understand and appreciate it.

         This system is fairer because it ensures that our clients with the same level of financial assets receive a similar assessment, no matter how their assets are invested. It is very predictable. This predictability encourages our clients to increase their total income by eliminating the risk of large changes to entitlements. By that I mean the short-term fluctuations in the market value of managed investments and shares.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It also simplifies the choice of investments. Treating all financial assets in the same way encourages those clients with whom we are dealing, day in and day out, to choose investments on their merits instead of their likely effect on entitlements. Also, it really puts the means test system as our pensioners understand and appreciate it on a more sound, long-term footing. Of course, we need to have this in place as the population ages. One of the comments made was, `Why are we having extended deeming?' We have called it extended deeming because, as I have said, we are putting it into place and building on what is already there.

         Other concerns were raised by the opposition regarding  financial investments, such as what deeming is going to include and what it is going to exclude. That, too, has been circulated.

         One of the things I reiterate, to make sure it is on the record for this debate today and so that we do not have these alarming statements going out to our pensioners and all of those people living on limited income, is that the financial investments do not include the individual's house or contents. It does not include the car, the boat or the caravan. It does not include the stamp or coin collection, if that is what they have. It does not include the standard life insurance policy or the holiday home, farm or other real estate. Income will not be deemed on any of these.

         Financial investments also do not include superannuation, allocated pensions, immediate annuities or allocated annuities. Actually, under the pension and allowance income test, the income from all financial investments will be assessed under one simple set of rules. That is why I continue to reiterate the fairness of the system this bill is now covering, the fairness of bringing into place a deeming that will allow people to have all of their assets fairly treated. We will not have a great differentiation between one particular group that has small savings and another that has shares, because in this legislation I believe we are looking after the interests of all of our clients—whether the opposition believes us or not. It is a fact and it has been accepted. We are creating a level playing field for people to make those investment choices. I can only reiterate that treating investments equally does encourage all of our people to select investments on their overall merits.

         I do not have with me the list of those people who participated in the debate, but I say generally that a number of other comments were made that our pensioners do not understand the impact of extended deeming. Our government has directly written to all pensioners and, through the

         Through our publicity we have stressed that our financial information officers provide a free service to all of our clients going through our Department of Social Security offices and, if there is any concern out there at large, `Don't listen to rumour, contact those people; they'll be only too happy to sit down, explain and provide the information and set out the rules for you free of charge as part of a service from the Department of Social Security.' We have found considerable interest amongst pensioners approaching our financial information officers. We have had a good community response to that information.

         It is also important to reiterate that deeming itself does not affect the majority of our pensioners. I would like to put an example on the record. If a single pensioner has no other income, then they can have as much as $43,000 worth of financial investments before their pension is reduced. Of course, it goes up for married couples. But the opposition is being alarmist by continually saying that people will have to stop their savings, withdraw them and change and, therefore, they are flustered and do not understand. Let me tell you: the response is that they more than understand. In fact, they are saying, `We very much appreciate what you have been able to do.'

         The member for Moore (Mr Filing), just before I rose on my right of reply, said again that no-one has advised the pensioners of deeming. I think I have covered that point. I would also like to reiterate that we sent out a personal letter to some 2.3 million pensioners. Within a few days of the budget, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) sent out a similar information letter to 350,000 Department of Veterans' Affairs pensioners explaining 12 months in advance the changes that were going to occur.

         Global Funds Management, the manager of MIT incorporating the old Estate Mortgage Trust, approached the government requesting that consideration be given under the social security income test to the particular difficulties faced by the unit holders in this area.

         In fact, I was very pleased when the Minister for Social Security announced on 25 October that concessional income test treatment would apply to pensioners and allowees affected by the failure of Estate Mortgage. That concessional treatment will now bring forward the extended deeming rules for MIT investments for social security customers who held them on 24 October 1995. Fortnightly social security payments will be adjusted from 24 October—in fact, they have been—to July 1996 when extended deeming will be introduced for all financial investments.

         At present, of course, the legislation requires that the rate of return be assessed on the managed investments, such as the MIT units but based on distribution of the change in value of the investments during the previous 12 months. Although there has been no distribution to MIT unit holders since the trust was first listed on the stock exchange, which was in December 1993, the price of the units has increased significantly over the past 12 months such that the rates of return in excess of 40 per cent are now causing substantial reductions in payments to some of our clients.

         As I have said previously, in dealing with social security legislation, which deals with people, the legislation is never set in concrete. We have to be concerned about change because people change and circumstances change, and I do not believe at any time that we can have legislation dealing with social security matters where we can say, `Here is how it is today; here is how it will be next year or the year after.' Of course we have to have amendments and of course we have to have flexibility, because without flexibility we are not taking on board—as a government rightly should do—the concerns of the people. We have to make sure that the present-day commitment is being serviced, and we have to make sure that those people we should care about at all times have accessibility and are getting what they rightfully deserve. I commend these bills to the House.

        The matter we are dealing with first is the amendment to delete paragraph 9 of schedule 2. Paragraph 9 says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        After the end of each financial year, each agency must give the Privacy Commissioner a report including matters relating to the data-matching program that are carried out . . .

       </para>
       <para>
        The reason for moving to delete that paragraph is that the opposition is of the view that the existing sunset clause ought to be maintained and that the parliament ought to be in a position to be adequately informed, particularly as to the way in which the data-matching program is being carried out. These provisions, of course, require for the data-matching program to be carried out under supervision and for certain reporting requirements to the parliament. They were part and parcel of the schema that was developed first by the Senate for ensuring that these provisions were adequately reviewed by the parliament on the basis of regular provision of information.

         I have certainly found the information that has been provided to me relating to the data-matching program comprehensive and helpful. It has enabled people to have a better understanding of how it is operating. The reason that we seek to maintain the clause relating to terminating the operation of data-matching is that we still have doubts as to how efficacious it has been. That is the reason for the approach that we have taken on this matter.

         If you are going to come to a concluded judgment that it has shown to be extraordinarily effective, as the government often claims, then that information ought to be available for the parliament to come to that view. The fact that we have come to a view at the moment that suggests that it has not been efficacious but we are prepared to give it extra time to ensure that it is able to work is a compromise on our part. As part of that compromise, the government ought to accept the continuation of the sunset clause and the reporting requirement.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for allowing us to have the amendments considered separately. I am sure that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and the opposition will agree when I explain why. I completely agree with the sentiments that have just been expressed. The amendments before us now concern two parts, which is reflected on page 21, paragraph 9, of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill. One is a deletion; the other is an addition. The addition is the reinstatement of the sunset clause, bringing it back to 1999. We have no trouble with that. In fairness and to get the bills through, if this is what is required we are quite prepared to accept it.

         In relation to the other clause, the honourable member for Berowra has just stated in his argument that he finds it very informative and that we should have the facility for the extension of the activity. But, in moving the amendment, he has eliminated completely the role of reporting. By eliminating paragraph 9 and not substituting anything else, he is basically saying that the participating agencies in tabling the reports in the parliament are in accordance with the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act.

       <para first-indent="16">

         To reiterate for the honourable member, the present requirement states that agencies report annually and separately. We admit that it is costly in terms of resources, and it is probably no longer necessary to demonstrate the value of the program. But, with that in mind, and to ensure that the parliament is adequately informed about the operation of the data-matching program, the bill provides for the data-matching act to be amended to require agencies to present reports to parliament every three years.

         The honourable member for Berowra, in moving the amendment on behalf of the opposition, has basically indicated that he does not consider that the three-year reporting regime is sufficient. I have just heard the debate, accordingly, to support that amendment. We on the government side are a little puzzled by the amendment which the member for Berowra has circulated. Far from requiring annual reporting by agencies, if the amendment goes through in its form now, it will dispense with the mandatory reporting requirement altogether. I do not think that he wants that, and nor do we.

         All of the previous reporting requirements under the data-matching act have been met. Unless further amendments are made to the act, there will be no future need for agencies to report. Paragraph 9 of schedule 2, part 2, of the carer bill seeks to amend the data-matching act so as to require agencies to report to the parliament every three years, with the interim reporting provided to the Privacy Commissioner annually. I am sure that the member for Berowra did not mean by his amendment simply to omit paragraph 9 without providing any alternative reporting requirements and to dispense with the reporting requirement.

         I am sure that many officers in the Department of Social Security, including me, would welcome that, but I do not think that is the intent of his amendment, and I do not think that is the intent of the government. We do not want to have eliminated completely the right of reporting, which is basically what this amendment would do. That is why I asked for consideration of the amendments in two parts.

The parliamentary secretary would know that the drafting of amendments is not something that I do in isolation; I do it with advice from the clerks. I in no way blame the clerks for this, but I have to say that your view as to my intention is correct. I will certainly accede, on the basis of this discussion, to a view that the matter will be dealt with not by division but by the voices. In the meantime, I foreshadow that we will examine more closely the submission that has been made and if we have to propose an amendment in another place in an alternative form to achieve our objective we will do it, and I think that is the more appropriate course to follow. I thank the parliamentary secretary for bringing it to my attention, although I would have been happier if I had been in a position to consider alternative advice, particularly as this was circulated some three weeks ago.

        What has happened here is that, in the drafting of the bill and some of the amendments that have been made accordingly, this matter was eliminated—it was never the intent to do so—and this minor amendment will make sure that that is now redeemed. I table the explanatory memorandum.

         —Schedule 6 is the schedule that I would like to speak to. I do not mean to entrap the parliamentary secretary in this matter but I have only just received advice of some concerns by Aged Care Australia in relation to the way in which the residential care allowance, which is to be implemented in schedule 6, is to be dealt with. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the residential care allowance is to replace rent assistance for people living in nursing homes and hostels. It states that the same rate, threshold, indexation and other arrangements will apply as now apply to rent assistance.

         People residing in nursing homes are currently paid rent assistance. This new form of payment is seen as a more appropriate way to address the circumstances of people living in residential care, while preserving the same level of entitlement. But the explanatory memorandum goes on to say that, in the longer term, the new residential care allowance is to be administered by the Department of Human Services and Health. However, in the shorter term, it will remain as a social security payment. It goes on to say that the people who will transfer from rent assistance to residential care allowance are basically those residing in nursing homes and similar accommodation which the Commonwealth supports.

         Aged Care Australia simply say that they have not yet been able to get detailed information as to the timetable for implementation of these changes, particularly the change to the Department of Human Services and Health. They have asked the government for discussions with peak organisations. They have also sought a response from the Department of Human Services and Health on a number of important questions.

         They ask these questions, and I hope the parliamentary secretary may be able to answer them. The first is: will the residential care allowance be paid direct to recipients, as is the case with payment of rent assistance, under arrangements which recognise residents' rights to manage their own financial affairs, or will it be paid to service providers as part of recurrent subsidies, therefore removing an important residential right? That is a particularly poignant question. It reflects on the government's philosophy of assisting people in residential care to be able to exercise personal responsibility.

         One cannot help wondering why there is a move to Human Services and Health, unless the government has in mind integrating the payment with other forms of payment that are made to the organisation itself—in other words, removing that personal responsibility. If the payment is direct to service providers, will it be regarded as folded into the service pension? If so, will the fees charged to residents be increased beyond the present 87.5 per cent for nursing homes or 85 per cent for hostels thereby reducing the residual amounts available to residents?

I am not meaning to entrap the parliamentary secretary, if it is appropriate to get advice at a later time, but I would foreshadow that we do regard it as a significant issue and one that needs to be clarified.

         I think the first part of your question was the concern raised by a number of people as to when the allowance would come into operation. I have been told that the department is giving consideration to 1 January 1997 but that it will not do that without consultation with the people concerned. It has been put into place in this way so that it has a certain amount of flexibility, but at the same time it allows us to pay the money to the direct services of those particular people in the nursing home.

         —The parliamentary secretary was seeking some assistance when I put the two questions. I will put the two questions again. When this change occurs will the benefit be paid direct to recipients or is it going to be in fact folded into the payments that are made to the organisation? It is a very important question because it goes to the issue of whether or not those people in care are assuming responsibility for their own financial affairs—the moneys that they have to handle.

         We have been spending a lot of time on the question of promoting the rights of residents. I often go into nursing homes and residential care facilities. We are told that these places should have a home-like environment. I have seen a sign pinned up on the wall—perhaps with blu-tack—saying that these are the residents' rights. In that way the residents are supposed to be acquainted with them. I do not know whether anyone has residential rights pinned up with blu-tack in the hallway of their own homes. I have not gone into it to that extent with my daughters.

         Nevertheless, there is this emphasis on people being able to accept some personal responsibility for managing their own affairs. It flies in the face of that philosophy if the government is going to incorporate it as part of the fees. The second part of the question is this: will it reduce the residual amounts of money available to residents? That is also a very important question. For completeness, some clarification of that would assist.

         —The amendments that I seek to move relate essentially to the Meridian Investment Trust issue in both cases. The proposal that we have advanced, in contradistinction to the situation that the government has addressed essentially through payments of an ex gratia nature, is to in fact put the trust unit holders in the position that they would have been in were it not for the fact that Estate Mortgage Trust failed and was later relisted. The implication of that is that the approach we wish to take would see them defined as saved investments in the same way that other trusts were saved if they were established before September 1988.

         Our proposal is to ensure that those folk who have these forms of market-linked investments, or Estate Mortgage trusts, are not disadvantaged by the government's unrealised capital gains test, which treats any increase in value as income for the purposes of the income test for pension eligibility. The government was obviously persuaded that these folk who owned the Meridian Investment Trust units were being disadvantaged. Otherwise, it would not have come up with the proposal for an ex gratia payment. There is no question that the case is justified. The only question is the way in which you address it.

         I think the government chose to treat the holders of Estate Mortgage units, now Meridian Investment Trust units, quite appallingly. They have sought to apply to them, at this point in time, the new extended deeming arrangement, which will apply to no other holder of units or saved investments, so that the unrealised capital gains test does not apply to them. It is a distinction which clearly cannot be justified other than on the basis that it is a compromise. The government is saying that they are trying to address the problem these people face, but they really do not want to give them everything. They will deem them to have had a five per cent or seven per cent return on those holdings.

         That is very grudging and quite inappropriate. In our view, the only proper way for this matter to be addressed is for the Meridian Investment Trust to be treated as all other investments that had a continuing existence and were saved investments. The only distinction in this case is that these people had already suffered a very significant loss as a result of the failure of the trust. The government has ensured that they suffer a double jeopardy.

         There was no justification for that. It is certainly something that I do not think the government is now trying to justify, but it is trying to say, `Our ex gratia payment is enough.' I say to the government that the better way of dealing with this is to treat them as saved investments and to ensure that these people were not disadvantaged at any point in time and were not disadvantaged further by this gratuitous application of the extended deeming arrangements for the several months in which they have had capital growth.

        This is the second veterans' affairs 1995-96 budget measures bill. It gives effect to the remaining government budget initiatives that need legislation. Many of the measures in this bill address the particular needs of our older veterans, most of whom are now in their 70s and served in World War II. In this year, while we have commemorated their achievements and sacrifices in that conflict, it is important that we continue to look at ways to improve our caring for their immediate and future needs. The initiatives in this bill, and other related measures that do not require legislation, demonstrate once again that my department is at the cutting edge of aged care.

         Before I address the specific items in this bill, I want to mention some of the government's 1995-96 budget initiatives that do not require legislation. The first is the extension of the free advisory and referral services of the very successful veterans' home maintenance helpline. This service will now be available to all veterans, war widows and war widowers. It provides a valuable support to those who own their own home by providing advice on a broad range of matters, from replacing a fuse to installing a new bathroom. Wherever possible, the helpline links the client to government subsidised services.

         The second valuable supporting initiative is the development of a program for discharge planning. This program will ensure that appropriate care continues after an eligible veteran, war widow or war widower is discharged from hospital. The program recognises that attention to the special needs of patients in the post-acute phase of an illness is important to their successful rehabilitation.

         People who provide full-time care for our veterans play an invaluable role. They allow many veterans to continue to live in their own home or in the community when they would otherwise be unable to manage. The carer's task is often a difficult one. My department is continuing to look at ways to assist the carers. Recently I was pleased to launch a practical guide for carers of people with dementia. Other initiatives to provide practical assistance to carers are being developed.

         Part of the support for those providing care in the veteran community is through the provision of carer service pensions. This bill includes a number of measures that extend access to carer service pensions and it also puts into place a number of changes that reflect the needs and situations of many carers.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Carer service pensions are now available only to those who are caring for veterans who receive a service pension. The bill extends eligibility for a carer service pension to those who are caring for certain veterans who do not receive an income support payment from either my department or the Department of Social Security. If the carer meets other existing eligibility criteria, a carer service pension will become payable to a person providing care for a veteran whose family income is less than $61,020, with assets of less than $559,250. These limits will rise in line with increases in the family payment income and assets tests.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         A similar extension of carer benefits will be made to war widows and war widowers who provide care for another person. These carers will be eligible for an income support supplement if the person under care does not receive a service pension from my department or a pension or benefit from the Department of Social Security but does meet the basic family payment income and assets tests.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The bill removes the current requirement that allows a carer service pension to be paid only where the carer lives in the same house as the person receiving care or adjacent to that house. As long as the person provides the necessary level of care, it will not matter where the carer lives.

         Another important budget measure in this bill is the continuation of the carer service pension for 14 weeks after the veteran is admitted permanently to a nursing home or other institutionalised care. The carer service pension currently ceases as soon as the veteran permanently enters a nursing home. The continuation of the payment to the carer will allow that person time to adjust to changed responsibilities and to make arrangements for their future income and possibly a new place to live.

         The bill ensures that those receiving or providing community care are not financially disadvantaged by entering into that arrangement. If a person leaves their home to provide care for a veteran, the value of their home will be disregarded under the service pension assets test for two years. Similarly, if the veteran leaves his or her home to receive care in some other place in the community, the value of the veteran's home will not be included as an asset for two years. In addition, those leaving their home to provide or to receive care will be immediately eligible for rent assistance if they are paying rent for their new residence.

         In addition to the change in rent assistance I just mentioned, this bill contains a number of other rent assistance measures. From March 1996, the maximum rates of rent assistance for families with children will be increased by $5 a fortnight. This increase reflects the higher cost often associated with renting private accommodation that meets the needs of families with children. The government also recognises the extra costs incurred by a single pensioner raising a child and, in this bill, increases the rate of guardian allowance by $4 a fortnight. The bill increases rent thresholds by $5 a fortnight to coincide with the March 1996 CPI increase. This increase ensures that rent assistance continues to target pensioners who pay relatively higher rents.

         The bill makes two specific provisions relating to these pensioners. First, it ensures that those income support pensioners eligible for one of these retained rent assistance payments who transfer back to my department from the Department of Social Security can continue to receive that payment. Second, the retained payments are to be gradually phased out. From March 1996, any CPI increase in the total service pension payments will be offset against those rent assistance payments until the total amount payable is equal to the total amount payable to others in the same circumstances. This change will achieve equity in income support payments without reducing the total amount paid to the pensioners.

The bill also includes two measures to assist veterans and other income support beneficiaries under veterans' affairs legislation in the management of their living expenses.

         The second measure will allow certain service pensioners access to an advance of their pension of up to $500 to assist them to meet unexpected living expenses. The government recognises that many service pensioners have limited cash reserves and can have difficulty obtaining access to lump sum amounts to help them meet costs associated with, say, emergency repairs and replacements. The lump sum advance of pension will have no interest or other charges. Repayments will be at a level the pensioner can afford, and can be spread out over six months.

         The budget provided for an adjustment to be made to the bereavement payment to the partner of a person who was also receiving a war widow or war widower pension at the time of death. The adjustment removes the limitation on the amount of the war widow or war widower's income support pension from the calculation of the bereavement payment to the surviving partner. The bill gives effect to this adjustment within a major rewrite of the veterans' affairs legislation relating to bereavement payments. This rewrite includes some minor policy changes to remove superfluous provisions or to correct inconsistencies. The new provisions significantly simplify what had become very complex legislation.

The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is to be changed as a consequence of the introduction of the residential care allowance and the rewrite of the bereavement payment provisions in this bill. That act will also include changes that follow on previous veterans' affairs legislation amendment acts. These changes include the introduction of income support supplement, and the repeal of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. There are also minor changes to the Fringe Benefits Tax (Application to the Commonwealth) Act 1986 as a result of the repeal of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. The Social Security Act 1991 is to be amended to incorporate a provision relating to rent assistance to social security pensioners or beneficiaries that is now included in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, but is being repealed.

         —I am happy to speak on behalf of the opposition in response to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (1995-96 Budget Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1995. Before I do so—I am not sure I have had the opportunity to do so before—I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) on his life membership of the RSL, which I am sure was well deserved. Indeed, as we have celebrated Australia Remembers this year, it has been a very good year for the minister. I think he perhaps might regret having taken on the mantle of Minister Assisting the Treasurer for Superannuation. He has already found that that is rather more complex and fraught with danger than being Minister for Veterans' Affairs.

         In safeguarding the interests of veterans and our older citizens, one has to realise how important their savings are to them. I think the suggestion that some pressure should be applied to superannuation funds to do other than act in the best interests of their policyholders and shareholders is one that would be of great concern—not only to people who are already retired and are living off their savings but perhaps also to those who are planning to do so in the future.

         It is a pleasure in these veterans' affairs debates to actually have the minister in parliament. We very rarely see the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) in here—he is always represented by his parliamentary secretary. We have just dealt with complex social security legislation, but we never get a chance to actually deal directly with the minister on such legislation. In fact, we never even get a letter from the Minister for Social Security. In every representation I make on behalf of constituents to the minister, I get a letter back from his parliamentary secretary. So I do not even know whether he can sign his name. But, to the credit of this Minister for Veterans' Affairs, he comes into the parliament when his legislation is debated, takes part in the debate and makes a contribution to it.

         The opposition does not oppose this particular legislation. We understand it is the second and final bill covering the 1995-96 budget measures for veterans. I will not go through the provisions again as the minister spelt them out in detail, but we accept that the vast majority of the provisions in this legislation do benefit veterans. The legislation is intended to bring the Department of Veterans' Affairs' beneficiaries into line with those who receive their benefits from the Department of Social Security. That, generally, is a principle with which we also agree.

         There are some savings in this legislation and they result from a small increase in the rent threshold. When this matter came up in the debate on the social security legislation, we expressed some concerns about that. I am not sure whether the minister alluded directly to that change in his remarks, but that particular change will disadvantage some people while it will advantage others. However, the net effect of that change, as represented by the savings which the government projects as a result of that change, clearly makes the point that some people in receipt of rent assistance will actually receive less assistance while others will receive more.

         The principle of bringing DVA beneficiaries into line with DSS beneficiaries raises an important fundamental issue about benefits for veterans. Whilst I would not argue that veterans should not get equal benefits with DSS beneficiaries where they are not getting those benefits, the point needs to be made time and again in debates on veterans' affairs in this place about the special treatment to which veterans are entitled.

         Over many years there has been a concern that veterans' entitlements have been diminished little by little—a trend I would like to see stop. I do not entirely blame this last 13 years of Labor government for that because I think it started before that, but it has certainly continued. Like today, very often it is only minor changes with which we are confronted. However, the net effect of them all over a long period of time has been a dramatic lessening of the benefits that our veterans get. Talking about benefits for veterans, these are `earned' benefits—things that they have given for, that they have sacrificed for, and therefore they are benefits that in many ways should be regarded as sacrosanct and not diminished. I had a constituent write to me just recently who made the point, very poignantly, when he said:

        When the war ended in 1945, a 100 per cent war pension was equivalent to the average wage paid to a clerk in the Commonwealth Public Service.

       <para>
        Obviously a benchmark was intended at that time. But he goes on in some detail to illustrate that now, over many years—and he mentions both Labor and conservative governments—those particular entitlements are very much less than that benchmark.

         He asked me what I was going to do about it. I was not able to say that we on this side would be able to return the benefit, or any of those other benefits that they originally had. But I certainly did say to him that I could give him assurances that a coalition government will be committed to maintaining veterans' benefits and that I would continue to do my utmost in the parliament to ensure this happens.

         The point I am making there is that whilst this legislation is intended to bring DVA beneficiaries into line with DSS beneficiaries—and, as I say, that is a principle which one cannot agree with—if you turn it around the other way, the important point I want to make, the point I make at every opportunity when I speak on veterans' affairs matters in parliament, and not only the government but all members of this parliament should keep making the point, is that veterans are special, that their entitlements are special and that they should not be diminished lightly or capriciously. Over the years we have sometimes seen this being chipped away, little changes here and there which, over a long period of time, have had the effect of diminishing benefits to veterans.

         These people, of course, have earned those entitlements through the service they have given to this country. That is what this particular year of Australia Remembers has been all about. We in this place do not pay credit lightly to a member on the other side, but certainly the Minister for Veterans' Affairs at the table today is largely responsible for the fact that it has been a very good year, that Australia Remembers has been a success and that it has highlighted in many respects the concerns of veterans. Hopefully it will have created a climate whereby veterans' affairs will continue to be regarded as very important, not only by the members of this parliament but by the people in the community at large, and particularly by younger people.

         After all, the emphasis of Australia Remembers has been on educating young people in Australia, and many young people I think have had the benefit, during the Australia Remembers year, of perhaps understanding more fully than they have ever understood before what actually went on in Australia in those dark years between 1939 and 1945. To the extent that the minister has overseen this particular year and largely been responsible for the success of it, he deserves congratulations.

         But the important point that needs to be made in the context of this legislation is that we in this place ought always be concerned to ensure that benefits for veterans are in no way diminished. In fact, in opposition it is easy to argue that they should be enhanced, but the important thing that we ought to accept as a starting point is that they should be no further diminished. By and large, this particular legislation advantages veterans to the extent that it brings them into line with Department of Social Security beneficiaries, and for that reason the opposition does not oppose it.

         One other matter in the broad context of veterans' affairs that I want to raise while the minister is here is the concern that still exists in New South Wales about the downgrading of care to veterans and war widows as a result of proposed changes to the domiciliary nursing service. Some time ago I raised this matter in a veterans' affairs debate, and the minister at the time kindly picked up the point and corresponded with me in some detail about it. I raise the matter again because, despite the assurances he gave me in the particular letter he wrote, I am not yet convinced that there is not still a real concern here. Certainly the nurses in the private sector in New South Wales are still telling me that they are concerned, and I share their concern about the potential impact that this may have on 7,000—

         We know that we have rapidly growing superannuation funds coming through the system which this government has put in place. That certainly will do wonders for improving our savings performance. We know that that kind of delivery of savings will give us a boost of 1 1/2 per cent of GDP on top of the half per cent that we are currently getting by the year 2000.

         —I will finalise the answer. In his speech the minister assisting me for superannuation made the point that under us there would be no direction of investments. He made that point specifically in the speech and, as I have made clear many times over the course of this year, it is not government policy to give directions as to where superannuation assets should be invested. That is a matter for the funds themselves to decide in terms of what they see as an appropriate investment under the obligations that the trustees have to invest to the best benefit of the members. That is the overriding obligation on the trustees and we will not be directing them in a way that would interfere with that overriding right; we will not be directing them at all in terms of where to invest their funds.

         That is not to say that we cannot encourage them to invest in certain ways, and various statements have been made about that. They have been an indication of government concern to see investment in some areas, but not a direction by the government in a form which compels superannuation funds to invest in any particular way. Whether superannuation funds want to invest to take up particular debt instruments that might be available through a refinancing arrangement is a matter for them to decide. If they believe that is an appropriate form of investment, that is open to them. It would be one possible form of investment, but there is a multitude of possible forms of investment. If they want to invest that way, that is open to them.

         —I thank the honourable member for his question. It raises an important issue. As members are aware, interest rates, particularly home mortgage interest rates, are something that the community generally takes a great interest in. Of course, since the end of last year there has been a downward drift in the average mortgage rate of interest paid, as shown by the fact that on the stock of loans the average rate at the end of December last year was 10.01 per cent and in September this year, the latest figures we have, it was 9.67 per cent. So we have seen this downward drift. People might say, `How can that be with the variable rate at 10 1/2 per cent?' That is because there are other rates, which are increasingly important in terms of the total volume of mortgages, which are not on the bank variable rate.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In that respect, fixed rate loans are of growing importance. They account for about one-quarter of outstanding mortgages, and the rate of a three-year fixed mortgage fell from 10.3 per cent in December of last year to 9.6 per cent in September, reflecting falling interest rates in the bond market. So we have had a considerable decline in the rates of fixed rate loans. The loans need not be fixed for just three years; they can be for two years, three years or five years. But all of them have been coming down based on that falling interest rate in the bond market. At present, home buyers on a three-year fixed rate mortgage can get a loan at 9 1/4 per cent, so considerably less than the 9.6 per cent in September.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Another major influence on this decline in interest rates has been the impact of new entrants to the home lending market. These include mortgage originators such as Aussie Home Loans, which I am sure most members are familiar with, as well as new lenders backed by superannuation funds, life insurance companies and even the RACV in Victoria.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The development of strong regional banks and the conversion of some building societies into banks have also added to the level of competition. The mortgage originators are offering variable rate mortgages at on average around 1 1/4 percentage points below those of the major banks, so they are on average around 9 1/4 per cent instead of 10 1/2 per cent, and some individual lenders are offering loans at rates below nine per cent. The superannuation members home loan scheme established by the National Mutual company with a number of industry funds is lending money for home loans at 8.7 per cent.

         These new lenders are posing a major threat to the market position of the major banks. The first reaction of the banks has been to try to remain competitive in the new home loan market while protecting the margins on their existing stock of loans. You have the so-called honeymoon rates, which apply to about 20 per cent of the outstanding mortgages—essentially the first year of a loan. Those rates are around 2 1/2 per cent less than the 10 1/2 per cent variable mortgage rate. At present they are around 7.9 per cent. Just a couple of days ago, Advance Bank announced that it would reduce its honeymoon rate to 7 3/4 per cent. Through this way, through the honeymoon rate, we can see a considerable reduction in mortgage interest rates for those new home buyers coming in in their first year. It is possible for people—perhaps through threatening to go off to a mortgage originator—to have the bank continue that loan or some other discounted loan to keep them in their books. I am sure members are not unfamiliar with circumstances in which that has happened.

          Financial Review

         reports that the major banks are launching new mortgage companies offering no-frills, budget-priced home loans. Once again, this is an attempt to compete directly with the mortgage originators in the new home loan market, while protecting the margins on their loans to existing customers. This policy has been one of trying to compete with the mortgage originators in respect of the new home buyers, whilst protecting the rates that they are charging on the existing stock of mortgages.

         That becomes an increasingly difficult tactic to pursue. We finally saw a breakthrough in that yesterday with the announcement by St George Bank that they are going to cut their variable mortgage rate by 0.5 per cent for customers who have had mortgages for over five years, taking that rate to under 10 per cent. That, of course, is a very significant move. I think that is the beginning of a number of cuts that we will see in variable mortgage rates. Other banks will be forced by competition to make similar cuts.

         What we have therefore is a situation where competition in the banking industry, which is itself much more competitive than it ever was before this government came into office, plus the new players in the game—the mortgage originators and other companies like superannuation companies and life insurance companies that are getting into the mortgage business—are putting enormous pressure on the banking industry to reduce its overall home loans. We have seen that in respect of the honeymoon rates in particular but now we are starting to see it in respect of the stock of loans. We can clearly expect that there will be further cuts in variable mortgage rates as this competitive factor continues to bite.

The question that the Leader of the National Party raised, which was ruled out of order by the Speaker, went directly to matters that were put in this parliament yesterday.

But in order to reject the findings, she must dispense with the evidence because these are findings not made on the basis of any evidence given by Richard Court to the commission, not made on the basis of any evidence given by any member of the Liberal Party to the commission; this was the evidence given to the royal commission by all her Labor cabinet colleagues.

        This is a ruling which cannot stand; this is a ruling which has been dissented from. This is a ruling which is not consistent with past practice. This is a ruling which will hamstring the most important issue to come before question time: namely, whether or not ministers can be trusted with the truth. This is a ruling which this House should not accept. This is a ruling which should be dissented from.

        People will ask themselves, `What has happened between yesterday and today that would make you have an entirely different attitude?' Surely we won't be able to draw the conclusion that it suits the government's political convenience to try to shut this down. We would be very disappointed if there was any suggestion whatsoever that this was just a low tactic from the government because this minister looks very fragile. Yesterday, when this minister was asked some very basic questions she was unable to answer them.

       I have here a legal opinion which you thought suited your convenience. It is a legal opinion prepared on this very point. It has actually been tabled in this chamber. It is dated 22 August 1995 and it is from none other than the Solicitor-General, Gavan Griffith. Let me refer you to the fourth paragraph of this legal opinion. I will read the whole thing so that the point is not lost on anybody. It says:

       To avoid this difficulty, and in order to enable payment to be made . . .

      <para>
       Let me pause there. This is the payment to be made out of taxpayers' funds for the minister's legal expenses—the expenses specifically relating to her challenge to the jurisdiction of the Marks royal commission. The advice goes on:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       To avoid this difficulty, and in order to enable payment to be made out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance for legal expenses as they are incurred (with that payment subsequently confirmed by formal appropriation), reliance may reasonably be had on the alternative source of legal authority in paragraph 4(4)(b) for the payment as a benefit `afforded by the Government to a Minister for the purpose of carrying out functions as a Minister'.
      </para>
      <para>
       It continues:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Given the public acknowledgment by those initiating and supporting the Marks Commission, as well as those opposing it, that the matters being inquired of are directed to the issue of Dr Lawrence's continuing fitness for public office as a Commonwealth minister, these matters are open to be regarded by Cabinet as directly relevant to her continuing to carry out her functions as a minister.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is the government's legal advice. This is part of their defence of the appropriation of public funds for the minister's legal expenses. In the light of that legal opinion, how can you then claim, as you do, Mr Speaker, in support of your ruling, that this matter is beyond those public affairs with which the minister is officially connected? The whole basis of the argument in support of the paying of her legal fees is in fact that those affairs are directly related to her functions as a minister.

Unless this was a High Court judgment, there is no more conclusive repudiation of your claim. Given that fact, we are therefore entitled to ask: on what basis could this ruling possibly be made?

It was a very critical question because part of this minister's campaign of defence is to say that this is a matter which has arisen on our side of politics. The truth is that it arose on her side of politics with her colleagues. It is the evidence of her Labor Party colleagues in Western Australia which has damned this minister. It is not the evidence of the Liberals that has been so critical in the decision of the royal commission. In fact, it is the evidence of a long list of her former parliamentary colleagues.

        —The opposition tactics committee, Mr Speaker, has made a silly mistake in the question that they put before you. In being careful in the past in the way in which they have asked questions about this when they have actually attempted to relate it to issues of fitness for office, or attempted to relate it to the opinions of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) on whether or not she believes that a certain standard of behaviour is required of ministers in a contemporary context, they have at least kept a fig leaf of connection with standing order 142—and that is why your generous interpretations of standing order 142 in the past on this matter have been totally applicable and properly upheld. Let us remind ourselves of what standing order 142 says. It says this:

        These standing orders were not written by this government, nor might I say—because they were canvassed in the course of debate in a manner critical of you—were the standing orders relating to relevance in answers written by this government. These standing orders were last revised in detail both as to the relevance area and generally on the way in which the questions under standing orders have related by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who sits over there doing those revisions of those standing orders, and we have not altered them. We have implemented them and Speakers, including yourself, have implemented them with a slightly higher degree of generosity than has been the case in our experience of Liberal Party Speakers in opposition—and I still have been here long enough to be able to remember them—but, nevertheless, fairly.

        Dr Wooldridge's question yesterday was referred to by the opposition spokesman on parliamentary matters, the manager of opposition business. I will go to his arguments because at least he made a fig leaf attempt at addressing the standing orders in this regard as opposed to the meretricious player that kicked off the debate, who made absolutely no attempt whatsoever and thought he could get up with his usual 20 minutes of calumny and not be interrupted during the course of this.

       I must say that that was skating on pretty thin ice, but at least it had some element of relevance.

        But what was this question? This question said, `Can you explain the motives of a set of members, X, Y, Z'—full stop, end of story—not `Does that relate to your fitness to hold public office; does that relate to whether or not you believe ministers ought to be truthful before parliament; does that relate to whether or not there is some other aspect of the activity of the royal commission that challenges whether or not you ought to be in office?' It was simply this: `What is your opinion of X, Y, Z'—full stop, end of story. There was no remote effort to make a connection between that and the issues that are matters of debate here.

Criticism went to you, Mr Speaker, for example, that you had failed to give an appropriate explanation for your ruling.

There was a simple, competent performance by the whip and the tactics committee to tell me, `Look, old son, you've got it wrong; you were probably trying to ask a question about something that you were entitled to ask a question about, but you just did it the wrong way and that is all there was to it'.

You would have actually gone back and said, `I am sorry, Tim has been made a patsy of again. The Liberal Party people who wrote his question for him a la Sinclair's suggestions about him have sent him over the hill to be shot to pieces yet again, which is becoming a depressing habit on the part of the Liberal Party as far as these matters are concerned.'

         —I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. The signing up by all governments to the national competition policy in April was a triumph for this federal government because only a federal Labor government, which has a national structure and a national vision, could have achieved such an outcome. The opposition, made up of state based parties all with their own agendas, could never ever have achieved the outcome that we achieved in April.

         With the significant achievement of the Prime Minister in Osaka at the weekend in lowering external trade barriers, it was important that we also lower internal trade barriers in Australia. The national competition policy achieves this, particularly in the areas of electricity, gas and transport. It has been estimated by the Industry Commission that the national competition policy has benefits to the Australian economy of around 5.5 per cent of GDP, or $23 billion. They are reforms that are really worth having.

         To implement economic reform you have to understand it, you have to understand the world in which the Australian economy operates, and you have to have the capacity to implement it. The Leader of the Opposition has already demonstrated that he does not understand it because in a press release some time ago, when dealing with the union-busting exercise on the Fremantle wharf, he said that it went to the heart of the Hilmer reforms. Of course, it had nothing to do with that.

        I have moved this censure motion when I have for one very simple reason: that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has been given ample opportunities today and yesterday to explain. She has been indicted in a way that no other minister in post Second World War Australian federal politics has. She is a minister whose reputation has been systematically dismantled by a royal commission and is a person whose political reputation and integrity has been destroyed, not by the actions of the Western Australian Liberal government but by the actions of her own former Labor colleagues.

         The reason that we bring on this motion when we do is that, during the past couple of days, the minister and the government have had ample opportunity to explain to the parliament and, through the parliament, to the Australian people why it is that Marks got it wrong; why it is that her former Labor colleagues got it wrong; and why, in defiance of all convention and all semblance of the basis of our Westminster system, this utterly discredited minister should choose to cling to office. It is in defiance of one of the most damning findings that any minister could have had brought against her. The real nub of this whole issue—and it is not the nub of the Marks royal commission—about her fitness to remain in office is summed up in a paragraph in the Marks royal commission. Commissioner Marks said in paragraph 4.1.5:

        In other words, Commissioner Marks was talking about something that goes to the very substance of this whole debate: that none of the 14 people who gave evidence against Carmen Lawrence in the royal commission had a vested interest in falsifying their evidence. If anything, they had a vested interest in giving evidence that would support her, because they were former Labor colleagues. Minister, you had taken the same oath or affirmation; you had stood shoulder to shoulder in the same government. These were not Liberals who were bringing you down; these were not Liberals who were calling you a liar—an accusation that has been substantiated by the royal commissioner—these were Labor colleagues of your own.

         It is no wonder that Kim Beazley gets very nervous every time we read out the list. Let's see whether the puppet is still activated. Let's see whether Billy Bunter over there is still sensitive to what is being said. I will read out the names again. Let me make it clear that the context in which I use these names is very important in that it was the words, the evidence and the blowing of her cover by Keith Wilson that really led to the foundation of this royal commission. I have to say to you, Minister, that you have been found guilty of what can only be described as the Watergate syndrome. Everybody in Australia knows that you conspired to lodge that petition. You know it; your former Labor colleagues know it. If you had had the guts to stand up in the Western Australian parliament three years ago and admit that you had made a mistake, your reputation would not now be in tatters.

We thought that it would take some of the heat away from the fact that I was going to get sprung for keeping $5,000 of my imprest account in my private bank account for a couple of years and pretending that I had forgotten it,' and if you had had the courage to admit that you really did conspire with Halden and all your other mates, you would have done that and said to the Western Australian parliament, `You cannot blame us. We were trying to get something on Richard Court. We were trying to make Richard Court look a bit silly.'

         I go again and again to the constant claim that has been made in your defence by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He has been unwilling to demand of you what Gough Whitlam demanded of Rex Connor and Jim Cairns and what he would have demanded of other ministers who deliberately lied to the parliament. Bob Hawke demanded the same of John Brown, although the latter did not deliberately mislead the public; he did it inadvertently. In other words, the whole basis of the defence that has been mounted of you is that in some way this has been a conspiracy against you by the Liberal Party. The defence is that it is all the fault of Richard Court and John Howard and that we all conspired to give evidence against you.

None of those people belong to the Liberal Party. All of them are members of the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party, although I understand that, as a result of what has happened in this royal commission, Keith Wilson has decided not to renew his membership. None of those people conspired with Richard Court or John Halden. They have never met Keith Wilson. I do not think I have met any of them. I may have met Jim McGinty in passing.

         It is very clear, if you go back through the history of this matter—and I will do that very briefly—that the matters that were included in the petition that became known as the Easton petition were first raised by the Liberal Party. There has been no doubt about that, and it has never been denied. It cannot be denied because it is on the public record. They were raised again by Mrs Campbell via a parliamentary committee despite assurances she had apparently given to her former son-in-law that they would not be.

The number of people named in that report was extraordinary, yet there was no comment on what the minister and the Court government clearly knew; that is, the DPP had cleared the whole matter. A day later, after pressure from us, they finally tabled the letter from the DPP.

         I have said all along that this was never a matter designed to get at the truth, something which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) claims to set great store by. It was always designed, firstly, to destroy me and, secondly, to attempt to drive a wedge between members of the Labor Party who of course after three years will have differing recollections about what occurs in cabinet meetings. I am sure that any member here who is at all honest about their own experiences in meetings will agree that, in the absence of very clear minuted outcomes—even then there can be disagreement—there is often disagreement about the whens, whats and wheres of them. If you look fairly at the evidence that was put before the commission—something the commissioner did not do—you would have to agree that there are a great many discrepancies in accounts, including amongst those who are said to all agree. But they do not. They do not agree about what was said, whether petitions were mentioned, when it was said—early or later—or how much detail was gone into. Those people who say that there was no such discussion are simply ignored.

         —The findings of the royal commission, as I have already said in question time and publicly—I am happy to repeat this—should be ignored for a number of very important reasons. Firstly, as I say, it should be ignored because of its conception and its origin. It was conceived in malice and was established for the most improper of purposes. Its establishment is itself an abuse of executive power, which incidentally is something the commissioner did not find. Although it was entitled `the Royal Commission into the Use of Executive Power', one of the few findings at the opening was that there was no use, let alone abuse, of executive power. To act on its findings, as I have said, would be to condone that abuse of executive power, which was not examined or allowed to be questioned about in the royal commission.

         Secondly, the conduct of that commission was gravely flawed. I have already given some indication of that and I will outline that further. It lacked procedural fairness and the report itself was highly tendentious and virtually devoid of any rigorous analysis. For example, the evidence of the former Western Australian Attorney-General, which basically confirms mine, was dismissed as if he did not know what he was saying. He said very clearly that he does not recall at any cabinet meeting ever this matter being discussed. His evidence is dealt with in approximately half a paragraph. Similarly, other staff who disagreed with some of those members of my staff who said that there had been briefings either were dismissed as having motives or, in the case where they clearly no longer had motives, were simply ignored. The evidence of Ross Love floats off into the ether as if he had not spoken.

         There was no analysis. There was no attempt to say this on the one hand and that on the other hand. There was no attempt to account for discrepancies, as my counsel did in their submission. There is basically a desire to believe that either you are telling the truth or you are lying. As you would know, in many of these examples, what you will have, as I said at the outset, are differing recollections. I have not sought to construe the motives of those people who disagree with me as unpleasant in any way. They need not be. I have said on many occasions that of course I am capable of making mistakes. Where it has been drawn to my attention that I have made mistakes, I have apologised to parliament and corrected records and, in many cases, I have done so in public. That is the second point I would make. The third is that—

If we as a community accept this as a legitimate exercise, we accept that commissions can be used for these purposes. When, for instance, Labor is returned to government in Victoria, they will be able to go back and investigate the sorts of contracts that have been entered into by Mr Kennett involving Mr Walker and others. Will it be legitimate for them to go back to all the cabinet ministers at the time in a matter which is frankly suspect and investigate?

         One of my colleagues has just mentioned Wanneroo Inc. At the same time as Mr Court has been obsessed by the question of whether my account of various events was accurate, he has not been prepared to have an open inquiry into matters where there have already been two people gaoled for corruption. So we have enormous double standards operating. There is no royal commission into matters of frank corruption when it comes to Liberal Party involvement, but there is a royal commission into matters of disagreement about events in the Labor Party. By the way, you might note that the commissioner made no reference to what was said or not said in the parliament.

The first myth is that royal commissions in some way have authority conferred upon them because they are royal commissions. That is not the case at all. They are a method of inquiry and judgment of them in the end will depend on how well and how properly they are conducted. I am sure members here will know that there are a great many inquiries and commissions whose findings have been thrown into the bottom drawer. I understand that was pretty much the treatment that Mr Fraser gave the meat substitution scandal inquiry when one of his ministers was named adversely. I do not think anything came of that, and they were more serious allegations. In that respect, this commission deserves the same fate.

         Commissions are a tool of executive government and they can be misused. I draw attention to the fact that in this case it is very clear indeed that anything that involved the Premier or his staff was simply ruled out of order by the commissioner. There was no investigation, for instance, of a question that was put by my counsel about whether there had been a briefing of counsel staff, counsel assisting and others by the Premier's office, particularly his staff.

         It was a very interesting little interchange. What happened was that, in the commission itself, this matter was about to be raised. Mr Court had been asked whether he wanted to continue giving evidence. He said, `Yes, I'm happy. I don't need a cup of tea; I don't need a break.' Then Mr Gyles started to ask him whether or not there had been any briefing by his political staff of the commission, whether they had given any information and who had talked to them, et cetera. Suddenly, Mr Court found it necessary to put up his hand like a school boy and ask to be allowed a break. When he comes back from the break, suddenly the whole matter is discharged and the commissioner refuses to deal with it.

         That undermines the commission's independence right from the outset. The commissioner was not even prepared to have that question examined. Mr Court was asked in the parliament whether there had been any briefing by his team of people, like Elliott and so on, who had been putting this material together for three years. Don't worry about the Labor Party; this had been going on for three years, since we left government. The Premier was asked in the parliament whether any members of his staff held discussions with the commissioners, counsel assisting the commission or investigators associated with the commission on issues raised before the royal commission and, if so, when those discussions took place. This was the answer which the Premier provided to the parliament:

        That is the way this whole thing has been set up. Today when he was asked the question in a doorstop, the Premier basically left his staff to say that these were administrative discussions. When asked to define what `administrative' was, suddenly they all flew away. From the outset, that is what this has been about. It is not an independent tribunal either in its terms of reference—it does not reach back to the Liberal Party—or in the matters that could be decided upon.

         I could go through the evidence in detail, but time does not allow me to do that. In so doing, I would give credence to what I think has been a most appalling exercise—lacking in procedural fairness, refusing to call witnesses that would have given weight to my point of view, having no argument or discussion about the findings, ignoring the evidence of those people whose evidence was close to the view that I had put—and in all of this, doing so at the bidding of the Court government for the most malicious of political purposes, supported by the Leader of the Opposition, who was not able to remember exactly the nature of the conversations he had had with Mr Court.

         —The House has just witnessed a very important speech by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and a sad and pathetic defence of her position. Not once did she mention in any way, shape or form her response to the evidence given by eight of her former ALP colleagues as part of this royal commission.

         I think it is timely at this stage to remind the House what Royal Commissioner Marks found with regard to the minister, who has just run out of the House. He found firstly that Lawrence was briefed by Zoltan Kovacs and Ed Russell after they had been briefed by a member of the upper house, Halden, about Brian Mahon Easton's allegations and petition. He found also that Lawrence was briefed by Halden himself late in the week before the tabling of the petition.

         The Marks royal commission found that the discussion alleged by Keith Wilson and Pam Beggs to have occurred on 2 November 1992 did in fact take place. The Marks royal commission also found that Lawrence raised the matter later that day with her cabinet office CEO, Marcelle Anderson. In other words, the Marks royal commission found the evidence stacked up—that the evidence from eight of her colleagues and from her staffers stacked up—that it was correct and that the minister lied.

         on Thursday, 14 September, which the shadow minister for health correctly points out is one of the key turning points in this whole matter. I remind the House that the minister had been asked a week before whether she had been asked to resign and whether she had the support of her colleagues. Of course, it was only then, when Paul Lyneham asked her directly, that it emerged that she had to come clean:

         What I think is of more relevance is what happened on another matter, the Notre Dame matter, which the minister has decided to bypass completely in these discussions and debates throughout 1995. This matter is one on which she was tested again. This time it was not a royal commission. This time it was a parliamentary committee of the Western Australian parliament. It was back in September 1992.

         What did that committee find with regard to the statements, conduct and action of the then Premier in relation to Notre Dame? The parliamentary committee found that Carmen Lawrence, the then Premier, `lied and repeatedly misled the Western Australian parliament about the government's offer of a $30 million land package to Notre Dame and related financial guarantees given by the government to the university'. Remember: in 1989 Dr Lawrence was WA minister for education and subsequently was to become Premier. The Western Australian parliamentary committee found in respect of the Notre Dame matter that she had lied and misled the parliament. This conduct, sadly, fits a very grubby pattern of conduct.

At the time there were editorials calling for her to step down and own up in very categorical terms.

        The truth of the matter—simple facts—is that Lawrence voted with the government for the motion that the government support Rothwells with a $150 million guarantee. Lawrence voted for the motion put forward to support the government taking an equity investment in the Kwinana petrochemical project. She also voted against the motion to accept the McCusker report, in relation to which an amendment stipulated an urgent need at that time for an inquiry into WA Inc. She opposed opposition calls for a special investigation of Rothwells and she opposed motions for an independent commission of audit to examine government business dealings.

It had nothing to do with divorce proceedings. It related entirely to some borrowings, some activities related to WA Inc.

He was torn by his conscience and by what he might respond to the media inquiries. He decided to take leave from the parliament for a period of time. He decided to step back because he had to weigh these matters very seriously. I suppose that was a fair response in the circumstances. He was deputy leader to the then Labor leader, Carmen Lawrence. He had to sit there and work through this matter to reach a conclusion as to what his correct response should be. I admire Ian Taylor in the context that he did weigh very carefully what his response should be. And it was the truth.

Because they were not on our side, they were with a conscience and they were determined that the truth came out.

She no longer enjoys the right to hold the office of a federal minister of the Crown.

        I find it remarkable that the public accept the conduct of Royal Commissions as a means of obtaining evidence, bearing in mind that our forebears revolted against the Star Chamber, which was a standing Royal Commission of its day. Press and politicians alike seem quite anxious to call for Royal Commissions into all manner of activities, not pausing to consider that the powers of a Royal Commissioner are easily abused. Indeed the public spectacle of witnesses squirming under questioning by the Commissioner or by his assisting counsel provides dramatic copy for the daily press, to the delectation of many of its readers.

        That was Garfield Barwick's view of royal commissions. It is not necessarily the last view that needs to be put on royal commissions; nevertheless, it is one that needs to be taken some notice of. Because of that particular character of royal commissions, the motivation which underpins their establishment and the fairness with which they are conducted are absolutely critical issues in making judgments about their findings.

         It has to be absolutely understood that people do not go before royal commissions with protection. They go before royal commissions in which hearsay evidence is admitted. They go before royal commissions that do not in fact operate on a proper adversarial basis with a capacity to answer charges that are broad. Charges are allowed to remain vague in the course of a royal commission's consideration. The materials that are handled by a royal commission are not necessarily ordered in some fashion that leads to a conclusion. They tend to be entirely anarchic and impressionistic. Those are the problems with royal commissions. So when you are going to assume some sort of sanctity in the findings of a particular royal commission they are not to be dismissed out of hand; nevertheless, they are to be viewed with caution.

         As much as those findings are to be regarded, therefore, in those sorts of circumstances, so must the motivations that go to the underpinning of it; the selection of the people who appear before it and the order in which they appear. The processes by which people who appear before it are entitled to fairness in their treatment before that royal commission. The terms of reference of a royal commission, above all of course, are to be looked at as to whether or not they do permit a consideration of all the matters that may be relevant to the case, and at the end of the day the motivations of the government that established them.

         That is not to say that all royal commissions ought to be regarded with calumny and all the rest of it. But when you have a royal commission with the basis of this royal commission you are absolutely entitled to ask questions about that. This royal commission emanated from a couple of years of hate work that proceeded on a broad front against Carmen Lawrence by the denizens of the Court government—one of the most deceitful governments that has ever been in existence in Western Australia that attempts to pass judgment on its opponents when it harbours within its ranks a promotion of an individual to a ministerial status who used inside information on the introduction, for example, of the workers compensation act to phone his legal practice prior to it becoming public to ensure a ludicrous situation emerged where, on the day the whole process of workers compensation changed, there were 14 applications for compensation arrangements, 12 from one legal firm—his!

         Then of course we have the performance of Richard Court regarding his own peccadillos. Carmen Lawrence named the two members of the Liberal Party for their behaviour in the Wanneroo Inc. affair. This is a man we are supposed to regard as a person who takes royal commissions seriously, who views these things in a dispassionate and fair-minded way and who sets them up because he is seriously disturbed about public conduct and public morality.

There is only one reason why Wanneroo Inc. is not subject to the sort of analysis before a royal commission as Dr Lawrence was: it is because it contains the most intimate involvement of the entire northern suburbs of the Liberal Party. The lot are caught up in the process, invariably, as their chief fund-raiser goes to gaol.

         This piece of persecution of Dr Lawrence by Richard Court is not a stand-alone item. We have had another one from the Western Australian government. It had always been frightened that it had only the one punch going, but the one punch might not hang in there, so let us get a second one going. It had running in its office—not through the police—an inquiry into the possibility that Carmen Lawrence's administration of the Aboriginal affairs portfolio might have been deficient in the area of an Aboriginal education project that went ahead.

In most places where government documents go missing and turn up in a way that lends itself to a bit of gathering of evidence, a police inquiry follows—a police inquiry into the perpetrators, the perpetrators being, at least as far as we know, members of Mr Court's staff but possibly higher than that. We know that there was a police investigation proceeding, but had this matter been ordered and requested by the Western Australian government to look into? Oh, heck no!

They are not a balanced set of conclusions—which is what I think you would be entitled to have on the basis of evidence before you—but an absolute rot-ridden set of judgments. Having cast out on the terms of reference and having cast out on the political processes associated with it, Commissioner Marks then felt it incumbent upon himself to come to some very firm conclusions.

         What was his conclusion? It is interesting that you keep citing the cabinet ministers. Not one cabinet minister went into that place and said that a petition had been presented to them. Not one cabinet minister went into that place and said that there was discussion of the matters that were the subject of the petition—not one of them. They did argue and were at variance with the memories of Dr Lawrence. The issues of the Easton petition were blasted about the parliament and the press and to everybody else who felt like taking an interest in it for the previous four years. They alleged that those issues were raised there. But a petition? No. None of them came to the conclusion that a petition had been discussed in the cabinet proceedings, spilled out by Commissioner Marks against all precedent in terms of cabinet inquiries—not one.

         —in reply—I intend to sum up in a few minutes. I thank the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) for his contribution to the debate. I have noticed that, every time he speaks in this House on veterans' issues, he is very sincere in what he says—he is a veteran himself—and I have said that on a number of occasions.

         However, he continually does say that, over the years, there has been a diminution of veterans' entitlements. I just simply want to put on the record that that is not the case. It may be the way he looks at it. But, in recent years alone, there has been enormous improvements in the lot of our veterans, perhaps not in so far as making big increases in pension payments but certainly in terms of aged care services, extension of benefits and such initiatives as veterans' health week and allowing them to see osteopaths and chiropractors—there are just too many improvements to mention. I want to reject out of hand what the honourable member for McPherson continually says in this place; namely, that there has been a diminution. In fact, it has been the other way around.

         I also noted with interest the comments by the member on the subject of domiciliary nursing care in New South Wales. I know that just about all members of this House and also of the New South Wales state house have been written to by the Domiciliary Nurses Association. Naturally, they are very concerned. Up until now, some 93 per cent of all domiciliary nursing in New South Wales has been carried out by the private sector, whereas in places like Western Australia it has all been done by the public sector. The public sector is just as good—and, I understand, in some cases better—than the private sector in delivering these services.

         As the member for McPherson said, I did follow up the concerns expressed in this place recently and have been able to give him my assurances that veterans and war widows will continue to receive domiciliary nursing care which meets their clinical needs. The member asked how many showers per week a veteran receiving community nursing would get. I think he was implying that they will not be getting as many and therefore will not be receiving the same care as when they were nursed by private nursing services.

         I have looked into this matter for him and I can assure him unequivocally that a veteran who is being nursed by community nurses and who requires assistance with showering will be showered as often as is necessary. This can be every day but I understand that, on average, it is around three times per week. I would also like to assure the member for McPherson that, if after assessment by the local community health centre a veteran or war widow is assessed as not clinically needing a registered nurse to provide services such as showering, a follow-up assessment is made to ensure that home care is provided as required, which can include assistance with showering.

         In summary, I would just like to confirm that there really is no need for the honourable member to be concerned on this matter. I receive very few complaints, if any, with respect to community nursing around Australia. I have no reason to doubt that that will be the case, as new veterans come on line and receive care from community nurses in New South Wales. It is my responsibility as the minister for the government in this area to ensure that I get the best value per dollar in the area of veterans' services in so far as it relates to domiciliary nursing and I will continue to do that.

         I must say, and I have said it before, that when decisions are made by government in relation to domiciliary nursing of veterans and war widows in New South Wales, those decisions will be based purely on what is the best possible treatment that can be given to the veterans and not on what is the best possible way of looking after commercial domiciliary nursing companies. I commend the bill to the House.

         Schedule 1 is operative from 17 March 1995 and contains an amendment to item 31 in part II of schedule 4 of the principal act. The concessional item allows the duty free importation of aircraft parts, materials and test equipment for use in the manufacture, repair or maintenance of aircraft with the exception of goods used for the servicing of aircraft. Following the government's acceptance in 1991 of recommendations contained in Industry Commission report No. 9 on the commercial tariff concession and by-law systems, the terms of item 31 in schedule 4 were revised. By a broad application of the current conditions, it has been possible to import, duty free, most goods used in aircraft.

         The government has now decided to restrict the coverage of this item by excluding textiles and goods made of textiles for use on aircraft. This initiative will remove the competitive advantage previously accorded imported goods over locally sourced goods by the use of item 31. It will also encourage the use of Australian raw textile materials.

         Schedule 2 of the bill is operative from 1 April 1995. Customs tariff rates of duty have been subjected to a phasing regime since July 1988. Blood packs and blood pack systems used for collecting, processing, storing and administering blood and blood components have traditionally been classified by the Australian Customs Service as infusion and transfusion sets for blood and other fluids. They were subject to 10 per cent duty prior to 1 July 1995, phasing to five per cent in 1996.

         This classification was successfully challenged in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal with the result that the AAT set aside the customs classification, considering the goods to be properly classified to a duty free item. The immediate removal of the 10 per cent assistance would have had a detrimental effect on local industry and is not consistent with the intent of the government's tariff phase down program. This government is aware of the consequences to industry of sudden and large reductions in the level of protection. This amendment reinstates the intended level of assistance for the subject goods by specifically designating blood packs and blood pack systems used for collecting, processing, storing and administering blood and blood components in the tariff classification that Customs originally considered appropriate.

The previously legislated increase of five per cent for these goods planned for August 1995 will now not proceed.

         Schedule 4 is operative from 1 July 1995 and contains a number of amendments. The first inserts an additional note in chapter 27 to define `fuel oil'. In recent years, oil refineries have been producing fuel oils of lower density which are capable of being used in diesel engines. The effect of this note will be to exclude light fuel oils from the new definition of fuel oil, and in future those light fuel oils will attract the diesel fuel rate of duty.

         Secondly, the rates of customs duty on aviation gasoline are increased by 0.883 cents per litre on aviation kerosene and by 1.847 cents per litre on aviation gasoline. These increases were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in the 1995-1996 federal budget. The additional revenue will provide funding for aviation safety regulation and be part of the industry's contribution to the recovery of airway services costs attributable to aviation gasoline powered aircraft.

         Another change inserts in chapter 73 an additional note to confirm the tariff classification of razor wire.

         Turning to schedule 4, the first measure increases the excise on light fuel oil and forms part of the 1995 budget. Prior to 1 July 1995, the excise payable on all fuel oils was 6.7c per litre and the diesel excise was 32.5c per litre. This difference in excise of some 26c per litre encouraged some users of diesel fuel to switch to light fuel oils to avoid the higher excise. Given sufficient time, there was the possibility of a large number of diesel users changing to light fuel oil at a potential cost to government revenue of some $140 million for the 1995-96 financial year.

         However, the excise on light fuel oil was increased to the same level as diesel fuel on 1 July 1995 following the tabling of excise and customs tariff proposals on 29 June this year in the parliament. At the same time, eligibility for the diesel fuel rebate scheme was extended to consumers of light fuel oil. In fact, I suspect that few of those subjected to the increase in excise on light fuel oil would be able to then claim the diesel fuel rebate, as they would generally have switched from diesel to light fuel oil because they were ineligible for the diesel rebate in the first place. It is worth noting that on 1 August 1995 automatic indexation of petroleum excises further increased the excise on diesel and light fuel oil to 33.5c per litre.

         Government amendments to the original bill also increase the excise on topped crude oils used other than as refinery feedstock from 6.9c per litre to the same excise level as diesel and light fuel oil of 33.5c per litre. These topped crudes have been used as substitutes for diesel and fuel oil, raising the possibility of consumers avoiding excise by switching from diesel or light fuel oil to topped crudes. Again the government identifies a potential financial saving of up to $140 million per year based on the potential for large-scale switching from diesel and light fuel oil to topped crude oil to avoid excise.

         However, this estimate is based on the simplistic assumption that all users of diesel and light fuel oil could switch to the use of topped crude oil.

In consequence, the National and Liberal parties are not prepared to have excise revenue eroded by this loophole, particularly given the difficult state of the Commonwealth's budgetary position at this stage, with its much vaunted budget surplus disappearing a few months after its proclamation, and therefore we will not oppose the increase of excise on light fuel oil and topped crude oils.

         Also covered in schedule 4 are increases in aviation fuel duties. As of 1 July this year, the duty on aviation gasoline, or avgas, was increased by 1.847c per litre and the duty on aviation turbine fuel, or avtur, increased by 0.883c per litre. These duties and excises were further increased by three per cent on 1 August as a result of the automatic CPI indexation of petroleum product excises. Currently the duty on avgas is 19.65c per litre with a component paid to Airservices Australia for air traffic services of 17.2c per litre. The remaining component of 2.45c per litre is paid to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to fund air safety regulation. The increase in the airways services component of the avgas duty follows a recommendation earlier this year by the then Civil Aviation Authority for a 3.4c per litre increase, which was rejected by the industry and the government.

Specifically, many general aviation operators and private pilots only use the system rarely but still have to pay thousands of dollars a year in duty.

         On 1 July this year, the government increased the duty on avgas by 1.847c per litre and increased the duty on aviation turbine fuel by 0.883c per litre. It is the increase in avgas prices that the coalition takes most exception to. This is because a large percentage of this increase in avgas duties will be paid for by aircraft operators who will not enjoy the benefits of it. This makes the increase grossly unfair and highly inequitable. It will hit small aircraft operators in our rural and remote communities with yet another series of costs.

         As so often occurs to people in the bush, they will not enjoy the full benefits of the money they pay. As of August this year, over 19.5c from every litre of avgas goes on excise duties. Of this amount, approximately 2.5c or 13 per cent goes to help fund air safety regulation, while 17c or 87 per cent goes to Air Services Australia to pay for air traffic services used by avgas powered and other aircraft.

         The increase which came into effect on 1 July this year was 1.847c per litre. This is broken up into two categories. The 0.883c per litre will contribute to the safety regulations component. The second component is the 0.964c per litre which will go to airways services. The coalition does not oppose the increase in the safety regulation component. It is the opinion of the coalition that the safety of Australian airline services needs to be improved and the increase in excise duty will contribute to this end.

         It is the increase in the second component of the excise duty—that which goes to airways services—that I and the federal opposition most strongly object to. The major reason we do so is that it is fundamentally inequitable. An excise duty on fuel is being used to provide airways services for general aviation use, regardless of how often an aircraft operator uses the airways services. This is unfair because of the fact that only on rare occasions do many of the general aviation operators—particularly those in rural Australia—use the airways services, but they still have to pay thousands of dollars every year in excise duty for a service they never use.

         For example, agricultural operators are now paying the equivalent of $7,800 per plane per year for services they do not use. Farmers who use planes for farming and agricultural related purposes, but who would hardly ever use airways services, are having to pay the same amount as city operators who fly the exact same aircraft but who use airways services all the time. Is it any wonder that the people of rural and regional Australia have given up on this government?

Only recently, planes in my electorate that would never use these airways services were baiting a mice plague that was devastating the limited crops being grown in that area. These planes are not used for pleasure or carrying passengers; they are used for carrying herbicides, pesticides and, in this case, baits to combat the mice plague.

         I want to touch on light fuel oil, as the member for Gippsland did, because it is an important point. After 1 July this year, the excise rate on light fuel oil was increased to 32.5c a litre in order to bring it up to the same rate as diesel fuel. This was done because some business sectors use light fuel oil as a substitute for diesel fuel in order to get around the excise cost on diesel. This increase will have a serious impact on two industry sectors in particular: one is the marine tourism operator and the other is the rail freight sector.

         The increase in excise will have an impact on the marine tourism industry by making tourist services more expensive and reducing their capacity to be competitive. The reason the marine tourist operators first moved to light fuel oil was that they were excluded from the diesel fuel rebate scheme. This exclusion in itself is difficult to justify because tourism is a viable and expanding international industry in this country.

         In the absence of the admission to the rebate scheme, the use of light fuel oils allowed them to compete in the expanding world of international tourism. The increase in excise charges will remove that capacity to be competitive. It is only going to add another cost to tourism operators. At the end of the day, they will have to put up their charges. Who will pay? The consumer will have to pay. They will say that it is getting too expensive to see our Great Barrier Reef in North Queensland. People who come to Australia will tell their friends that things are more expensive if you go to Australia than if you go to another country. That is the bottom line with this.

Let us be perfectly honest, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) is another attempt to fix the holes in the government's budget strategy relating to diesel fuel excise. The latest changes seek to change the definition of fuel oils so that light fuel oils attract the same rate of excise as diesel fuel oil and to increase the rate of excise duty on certain topped crude oil.

         For one of my constituents, a constituent who operates a granite quarry near York in Western Australia's wheat belt, this is a very serious problem. His particular quarry has been a small affair which has been run until now by his son. The business was purchased in 1974, and because of access to the diesel fuel rebate it provided a very meagre profit for the owners, the Wales family. For small businesses, profit is the be-all and end-all.

That quarry business has found itself in a position where very shortly it may well have to cease operation unless it is able to compete more favourably against overseas competition. Sales of granite, for instance, have halved over the past five years with imports of granite from overseas—such as Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong—decimating the local market.

         This situation may be compared with the situation which arose with the imposition of sales tax on in situ pools, which was introduced by amendments to the sales tax legislation in 1992. The sales tax was ruled by the High Court to be invalid as a breach of section 55 of the constitution, as the act that imposed the tax dealt with more than the imposition of taxation. Consequently, the Swimming Pools Tax Refund Act 1992 was passed with the aim of ensuring that the sales tax that had been paid on such pools was refunded only to those who could show that they had actually paid the tax.

The fact of the matter is that we have an increasing tax burden on small businesses as a result not only of the direct imposition of increases in tax rates but also of the increasing complexity and difficulty in being able to deal with the taxation regime from which the increased rate will be taken.

         We have a situation where the whole of this fuel excise is like an uncontrolled monster devouring all in its path. The question that many small business people are asking themselves is, `Where next? What will we be faced with next? How will we be able to be taxed, or are our pips going to squeak before any more can be extracted from us?'

         I return to the quarry operation that I referred to earlier. Here we have a situation where a small family business is now basically being crushed by the totality of the taxation regime under this government, ranging from the treatment of fuel excise all the way through to the other add-on costs that make it almost impossible for it to be able to compete with overseas businesses.

         For instance, in recent times we have seen the types of problems that Australian industries are facing in the context of increased participation in competition with overseas operators who are exporting to Australia. Because of the Australian business tax regime, more and more of our local operators—particularly in niche markets such as the constituents are in in my electorate—are finding it increasingly difficult to compete.

         So what will happen in the case of the closure of that particular quarry business? Yet another Australian will be thrown on to the scrap heap, and we will find ourselves yet again with one less business and one less employer. If we are to solve the unemployment crisis in our nation, we must recognise that small business is the key. As we well know, small business is the largest employer in the nation.

         These particular tariff bills, as has been raised by previous speakers, serve to increase the complexity of the taxation arrangements. I have mentioned the extract from the

         </emphasis>
         which in itself is supposed to be a simplification of the way in which the bills will work. It is extremely complicated and difficult to understand. These sorts of costs, these extra imposts on small businesses throughout the country, add to the unprofitability or lack of competitiveness, and mean in the end that people will choose to cease operating and will find something else to do or some other way to use their valuable capital, rather than put their fellow Australians into work.

         Earlier I indicated I would make some brief comments on my concern that, in relation to the definition of fuel oils as a result of that budget strategy, we find ourselves in another situation where more and more complex taxation legislation is heaped upon small business operators who are increasingly less able to deal with this taxation regime. As we know, in the case of the income tax regime, there are several thousand pages of taxes. In the case of sales tax, it is more and more complicated and difficult to understand. Increasingly, the application of sales tax is corrupted by political decisions, and I intend to deal with other aspects of that in some of the bills that will be before us in this session.

         In the final analysis, a business tax regime that does nothing to ensure that the small business sector will be able to play its part in employing more Australians cannot play its part in being, I suppose, the prime mover in getting unemployed Australians back into the work force. It is unfortunate it has come to this, it is unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position, but again we find that complexity is the name of the game. At the end of the day the bureaucracy and the complexity of the taxation legislation come down to crush small businesses which are at this particular point finding it difficult to operate and to compete, even without extra taxation imposts.

         The honourable member for Gippsland sought an assurance that any unintended consequence of the effective increase in the excise duty treatment of topped crude to remove a potential diesel fuel substitution problem would not affect the excise duty treatment of topped crude where it is used otherwise than as diesel. I can give that assurance and note that possible regulation changes are being looked at to cater for some anomalous uses that the member for Gippsland alluded to which are not diesel fuel substitutes. This will preserve the existing concessional excise duty rate which presently applies.

         The government acknowledges that, while all avgas operators pay the same duty, not all operators have an equal call on the airway services provided by Airservices Australia. However, new charging arrangements are being considered by Airservices Australia. A review of services of general aviation, which has been undertaken in close consultation with the aviation industry, is nearing conclusion. The objective of this review is to examine the need for, and the cost incurred by, Airservices Australia in providing air traffic and rescue and firefighting services to general aviation. This will provide the opportunity to rationalise the provision of services prior to substantially changing the present charging arrangements.

        These amendments are operative on and from 11 October 1995. They are similar to provisions contained in the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995, which is being debated cognately with the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill. Schedule 4 of this bill contains an amendment to chapter 27 to define the physical characteristics of fuel oil. The result of that change means the fuel excluded from the definition will attract the higher diesel fuel rate of duty. The amendment is designed to eliminate the widespread use of light fuel oil as a substitute for diesel fuel by high volume diesel fuel consumers. That change is operative from 1 July 1995.

         As a result of the government's action, the production of light fuel oil since July has dropped dramatically. It has now come to the notice of the Australian Customs Service that production of topped crude petroleum oil has increased significantly since 1 July this year. Further, topped crude petroleum oil is being used as a substitute for diesel fuel. Again, there exists the potential for a multimillion dollar loss in government revenue.

         The changes contained in these amendments have the same effect as those taken earlier in the year. In other words, the physical characteristics of fuel oil produced from topped crude petroleum oils are defined in additional note 1 to chapter 27 and a tariff split has been created for this category of fuel oil. Goods not meeting those specifications have a separate subheading and will attract the higher diesel fuel rate of duty. A summary of the amendments contained in this bill has been prepared and has been circulated for the information of honourable members. I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum and I commend the amendments to the House.

        As with the amendment moved to the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, the amendment before the House now rejects inequitable use of fuel duty to fund the cost of providing airway services to general aviation. We have had an extraordinary concession from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay)—it has taken me quite by surprise—that the government is looking afresh at this issue of imposing fuel duty to provide airway services to general aviation. There seems to be a concession—I wait for the parliamentary secretary to repeat it—that it is inequitable to impose the duty on general aviation operators and private pilots who use the system only rarely.

         That does raise the question as to why we are proceeding with the imposition of fuel duty for the purpose of providing airway services to general aviation. Why not put the matter on hold until the discussions that he promises are under way with the industry at present are concluded? So I am quite at a loss to know—I would appreciate the parliamentary secretary clarifying this for me—why this particular aspect of the legislation is proceeding through the House when he holds out the hope of a newly structured cost recovery system which is more equitable to general aviation.

I repeat and rely on the remarks I made on the amendment proposed to the Customs Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, the first of the two cognate bills. If the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) had been listening to my comments in that regard, he would have heard me say that an immediate move to service and locate specific pricing would impose a severe financial burden on some important sectors of the general aviation industry. Therefore, the staged approach to modifying the charging regime is strongly supported by key bodies representing the general aviation sector. Even he understands that.

        The bill is aimed at increasing the flexibility of the operations of the Industry Commission, which is the government's major advisory body on industry matters, broadly defined. The government values the major contribution of the Industry Commission as a catalyst for micro-economic reform in Australia. Its strengths are its independence, established expertise, public inquiry process, and economy-wide approach to examining issues.

         The amendments contained in the bill are of a purely procedural nature and involve three basic changes: allowing commissioners to be appointed on a part-time basis, including permanent part-time employment, in addition to the current full-time basis; a consequential increase in the number of commissioners, other than the chairperson, from eight to 11; and allowing the progression of the commission's public hearings in emergency situations, where one or more commissioners may be unable to attend due to circumstances beyond their control.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The first basic change follows from the current provision in the Industry Commission Act 1989 which allows commissioners to be appointed only on a full-time basis. The government has found that this provision limits its ability to attract a more diverse range of suitably qualified people. This change will allow the government to recruit those who hold other positions and are unwilling to become full-time commissioners. Consequently, the bill has been drafted to allow the appointment of commissioners on either a full-time or part-time basis, with equal powers.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second basic change, of increasing the maximum number of commissioners, necessarily follows the first. The commission will need to maintain the same level of resources at the commissioner level, thus requiring more commissioners in total if there are to be part-time appointees.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third basic change is intended to provide additional flexibility to the commission in the conduct of its public hearings. Where one or more commissioners on an inquiry are unable to attend a scheduled public hearing due to unforeseen circumstances such as accident, illness or injury, the remaining commissioner will be able to preside at the public hearings.

         The second major amendment—allowing a single commissioner to act on behalf of all other commissioners on an inquiry in the absence of other commissioners but limited to public hearings and only in emergency situations—will also allow for the commission to operate in that, due to unforeseen circumstances such as accident, illness or injury, preventing one or other commissioners on the inquiry from participating in a public hearing, the remaining commissioner will be able to reside at the public hearing or part of the public hearing. It also adds some flexibility to the operation of the commission.

For those reasons of flexibility and, as I said, the eminent sense of these amendments, the bill will not be opposed by the coalition.

One of the stories in it, which is very relevant to this year of Australia Remembers, shows that a lot of people went away to war and, when it finished, they were overseas and they were never really welcomed home. A member of the committee that I chaired initially and then handed over to chairman Len Streets said to me that he never got a welcome home. When you think about it, those people were away overseas and they were not around when everyone was celebrating and Australia Remembers was the first time they were welcomed home.

        That encapsulates what many people experienced at the end of the Second World War. That book has various stories of great heroes and it is written to give a warts and all account. It is not something that was written by a historian that put only their views. This was written by the people involved. One of them, Alan Hopkins, wrote to me. He was a pilot who dropped food over the Netherlands in Operation Manna. He wrote to me to see whether he could get some funding to go back to the Netherlands or get a plane from the Australian government to take part in the celebrations in Holland. So I wrote to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), but that could not be arranged. He also wrote to the Dutch Embassy here in Australia and he received a letter back from the Counsellor of the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Canberra. This letter brings home to you a lot of what Australian people did overseas:

My mother made clothing for the troops. I remember that we always had plenty of mosquito netting around the place—I think she might have scored a little bit there. My father was a moulder and made bombs and shells. He used to come home late and he was always dirty—I can remember that. They are about all my memories of the war.

We had good fun, people enjoyed it and we did what we set out to do, which was to celebrate the end of the war, to remember it and, above all, to make certain that our young people were educated. We also set up a team of people to go around the schools and talk to school children and answer questions. That is continuing now. It is something that I found most enlightening. Many young people did not know anything about the Second World War. They knew nothing about it at all—even my own children, who are in their 20s. They had heard me speak of my grandfather. Because they did not know of anyone actually involved in the war, they knew virtually nothing about it. This year has made certain that they are aware of it and that they do not forget the lessons of the past. Hopefully, they will make certain that it will never happen again.

         It is fair to say that there would be very few electorates, organisations and committees that put more into this 12 months than my committee in Ballarat. A lot of things have happened in the last six years in my time as the member for Ballarat, but none has given me more pride than this group of people. It comprised Liberal Party politicians, former state members and people from right across the board. The committee represented people from all political persuasions and from right across the community. It worked extremely well. It is a classic example of the fact that this Australia Remembers year has included people from all sides and from all communities who were anxious to ensure that Australia Remembers was a bipartisan event and a great success.

There are many communities and they all had a very active input. In no particular order, there was the Daylesford street parade and memorial service and the unveiling of a plaque at Marnoo. The Ballan Hospital presented a patient trolley with a plaque as part of the celebrations. There was a Ballarat VP Day wreath-laying memorial service at the Cenotaph and the presentation of a memorial sculpture to the city council. The sculpture was designed by Mr Peter Blizzard and it is a stunning reminder of the last 50 years. Generation after generation will be looking at that memorial sculpture. It has pride of place at Sturt Street. I know that the committee and the local community are extremely proud of it.

Five hundred people could not get tickets. A portion of that show was put on for the region's school children the next day, on the Monday. There was a capacity audience. The risk with these things is to try to pick out names, but it was made up basically of Ballarat or ex-Ballarat talent. There were people taking part in the concert who have performed in Melbourne, Sydney and New York. They are young men and women of whom we are extremely proud.

         —One of the big problems facing all parliamentarians in state and federal politics is the issue of fuel pricing. There is a very great concern in the community, particularly in country and regional areas, about the high cost of fuel and the variations in fuel prices between regional and remote areas and city areas. Country residents are frequently required to pay from 7c to 14c a litre more than those in the city, despite regulation of maximum wholesale prices and transport costs. Fuel consumers in the city and country do not always have access to an effective, open, transparent and competitive market that stands the test of being fair to all consumers and free of discrimination. Fair and reasonable fuel prices for all consumers should be available, and something needs to be done to ensure that such a system is put in place.

         The RACV and the Victorian Farmers Federation have done some excellent work on this and I would like to thank them for their contribution and their suggestions which I will briefly summarise. This may not be precisely what they said but it is the gist of it. They call for the establishment of an oil industry voluntary code of conduct involving the introduction of a form of terminal gate pricing designed to prevent unfair discrimination between the retailers of fuel in the country and those in the city. They wish to ensure that wholesale fuel prices are published daily so that everyone knows what they are, that oil companies are able to set the price for fuel at rates that recognise the commercial reality of price differences based on volume sales and terms of payment—there have to be some variations there—and that all wholesale purchasers have access to fuel at the published rate applicable to the volume of fuel and the terms of payment involved in the transaction. It is proposed by the RACV and the VFF that this would ensure that wholesale fuel would be offered at the prices at the various terminals to customers and, furthermore, that there would not be a difference based on the geographic area in which the customer operates.

         Something that I feel very strongly about is that oil terminals should be open to any potential customer with an appropriate authorised vehicle and qualified driver who is able to purchase and establish the credit that is needed in a commercial transaction to ensure normal commercial practices exist.

         I believe that the RACV and the VFF, their members and many members of the public in Australia, particularly in country and regional areas, are crying out for the government to act to ensure that a new system of fuel sales is introduced into Australia and for this system to be monitored by the new Australian Competition and Consumer Commission so that, if evidence emerges of discrimination, uncompetitive practices or profiteering, this would give rise to immediate, prompt, appropriate action against those involved in such unfair and unacceptable practices. I believe that this suggestion by the RACV and the VFF should be examined by us all on a non-party political basis as it is worth while looking at. I believe the oil industry would find that this would also assist them in moving into the next few years.

         But the key point is that it is no longer acceptable to see fuel being sold in country areas only a few kilometres away from, say, the city of Melbourne at 7c to 14c a litre higher than the price in the city of Melbourne. Of course, we all understand that occasionally moves are made to gain market share and some marketing techniques are used that involve discounting. But, when the fluctuations in price are so large and occur so consistently, I believe that is prima facie evidence of a market force taking place which is not competitive, is certainly not transparent and which does discriminate. I am sure it is not in the commercial interests of anyone investing in the oil industry in Australia to be associated with practices that are becoming more and more abhorrent to the consumer. A good relationship between the consumer and the companies involved is the essence of the success of any future commercial enterprise.

Frankston council has a 49 per cent interest in this centre, and in 1988 I warned the council against it. I said in this House that it was ill-conceived and that the council did not have the experience to be involved in this sort of venture. I have, sorrily, been proved correct.

         What is happening with Quayside? As I said, it has gone into liquidation and it is up for sale. The actual Frankston council mortgaged the land that it was built on—that was their contribution—plus three other packages of land. One package of land that they mortgaged to the Commonwealth Bank was one that had a $16 million cultural centre built on it after it has been mortgaged to the Commonwealth Bank. Anyone with any business knowledge would say that this is foolhardiness in the extreme—and that is exactly what it is—by these councillors and council officers whom I must point out gave the advice to the councillors on what they should do with this land. Anyway, it was mortgaged to the Commonwealth Bank.

         I have been trying to stop the sale of one of these packages of land called Central Car Park or Lawrey's paddock. I have had negotiations with the Commonwealth Bank and with the actual council. But it seems as though all my negotiations have gone straight out of the window and that they will sell this paddock. Lawrey's paddock was actually sold to the Frankston council back in 1945. I will read something from the local paper at the time:

Now they want to sell this land, which was bought by the Frankston council at the time as a park for the people of Frankston. Another article from back in 1945 states:

        Why am I giving you the history of what happened back in 1945? Because we cannot find the contract of sale. I have been through all the council records. You would think that, with a large parcel of land, they would have the contract of sale, but it is not there. Where is it? No-one knows. We have been to the chief executive officer, but no-one can find it. I have been to have a look for it but I cannot find it anywhere in the records in relation to Lawrey's paddock. However, I have a letter here from the solicitor to Frankston council at the time, a Robert C. Taylor, which is dated 26 July 1945. It reads:

The reason why I cannot find it is that I believe someone has plucked it out of those records which have been held in the council and that it has been destroyed. I am searching for it and I will make certain that I have a campaign to save that land for the people of Frankston. These commissioners are there as caretakers. They are not to sell the assets which were given to the people of Frankston to be a green space, an open space. I will fight as much as I can.

I hope to make more speeches on this matter in the future.

Mr Speaker, day by day it is becoming clearer that the House of Windsor fails this basic test. It is bad enough that Australia's head of state is not one of us. Australia's head of state is the monarch of another country. But, worse still, on all the objective evidence the institutions of the British monarchy are held out for public ridicule and public embarrassment.

         The inquiry examined many aspects of the leasehold system including, first of all, whether it should continue. The inquiry concluded that it should continue for very good reasons. The leasehold system avoids land speculation, it allows unearned increments to be retained by the government to defray the costs of the ACT, and it ensures orderly planning by lease purpose clauses. The committee also found that the leasehold system was very unlikely to frighten any investor off.

         I regret to say that the inquiry identified major problems in the administration of the leasehold system and the planning system in the ACT. It is chapter 17 which looks into the present administration. The committee makes a whole series of criticisms. For example, it says that it is not difficult to identify sources of community frustration with the process of development when reasonable requests are refused. We see a whole series of examples of situations where, under freedom of information legislation, people have applied for access to information about why decisions have been made and have been refused on quite unreasonable grounds.

         There is a lack of disclosure of the interests of officers administering the system. The committee identifies problems of people who have had senior positions in the administration of land who have gone over and worked for the development sector. That obviously creates a conflict of interest. There are problems with compliance. There is a whole series of cases where lease purpose clauses have not been enforced. There have been complaints about that for years but still a lack of enforcement has occurred.

         Failure to take steps to force the lessee to comply with the lease purpose clause has meant that for 15 years there was a blatant and continuing breach occurring. One could go on. A whole series of problems has been identified. The report goes on to make some practical, reasonable and intelligent proposals for dealing with this problem. For example, the report proposes setting up a separate statutory authority for the administration of land. It proposes that planning be set up as a separate statutory authority. It proposes that all the senior positions in those two areas be declared vacant and that they be advertised around Australia in an attempt to attract the best professional people into those areas.

         I wish to conclude with a particular problem which concerns me greatly.

         However, in the period just before the election the public servants arbitrarily and unilaterally decided that the Department of Environment, Land and Planning would be located in Dickson, close to the centre of Canberra. That defeated the proposal which would have had the effect of increasing employment opportunities in Gungahlin. That was done entirely contrary to the declared intention of the former government and before a new government could be elected. It was an absolutely improper action by the public servants. The committee stated that on the basis of that example alone it is possible to conclude that a major planning decision was made in direct contradiction to government policy and political direction at the highest level.

         The government's decision to promote superannuation brings important responsibilities for the financial sector. Financial institutions and advisers must explain the benefits of long-term investment in a diversified portfolio. To encourage the industry to take a longer-term view on investments, the government now requires that funds report their average returns for the past five years, as well as individual figures for each of those years. Most importantly, fund managers must justify the government's decision to have superannuation managed in the private sector by investing responsibly and delivering strong fund performance over time.

         The government's prudential framework is embodied in the superannuation industry supervision, or SIS, legislation. The SIS regime makes it clear that trustees are legally responsible for running their funds in the best interests of fund members. A key duty of trustees under SIS is to implement an investment strategy which takes account of the fund's circumstances. The strategy must have regard to the trade-off between risk and return, the benefits of having a diversified investment portfolio, and the fund's capacity to meet its liquidity needs and future liabilities.

This will potentially yield better returns for investors, as well as contributing to the economic wellbeing of all Australians.

         The tribunal has made sound progress in its first year. In the 12 months ending June 1995, the tribunal received a total of 416 written complaints that were within its jurisdiction.

         Unfortunately, the tribunal has been subject to some criticism relating to the statutory limits on its jurisdiction. These limits have caused a large number of complaints to be excluded by the tribunal on the grounds that they could not be handled under existing legislative constraints. Included amongst these were complaints about disability benefits involving the assessment of medical evidence and certain complaints about life office superannuation products. This bill aims to improve the effectiveness of the tribunal by clarifying and strengthening its jurisdiction over these kinds of complaints.

         Firstly, it will protect the members of funds that arrange disability cover through an external insurer, by enabling the tribunal to make orders directly against the insurer.

         To further enhance the tribunal's efficiency in this area, the government will also support the development of `best practice' guidelines for disability claims handling by the superannuation industry. The peak industry associations are consulting closely with the tribunal and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to develop these guidelines, which will be published by way of a circular. Although compliance with these guidelines will be voluntary, it is expected that they will promote better decision making by funds and insurers, thereby minimising the volume of `medical evidence' complaints made to the tribunal.

         With regard to life office superannuation, it was always the government's intention that the tribunal should have coverage over all superannuation products, including those offered by life offices. Unfortunately, the legislation did not give full or certain effect to this intention, and the tribunal has been unable to effectively deal with a common source of complaint, namely, allegations about life office agent misrepresentation.

         The bill rectifies this problem by enabling the tribunal to deal with complaints about superannuation-related annuity products and life office agent misrepresentation.

         The government recognises that life offices have a strong presence in the highly competitive retail superannuation market, and that allegations of life agent misrepresentation have been a source of particular concern. However, they are not the only public offer superannuation providers, and it is important that all market players be treated equally before the tribunal, to the extent that that is appropriate and practicable. To this end, further amendments will be made at the earliest opportunity in 1996, to ensure that, as far as possible, the new remedies for sale misconduct are extended to all public offer superannuation providers and intermediaries.

         —This is probably my final speech on the subject of superannuation in this parliament. It is a field that I entered back in about 1981 when the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, appointed me as the chairman of a task force to examine a number of important reports which had been tabled on superannuation reform. Unfortunately, the election in March 1983 interrupted the Fraser government's examination of my report. Mr Keating—now Prime Minister—came forward with his proposals in June of the same year. So, while it was claimed by the government that they were the founders of the major changes in superannuation policy, it is important to point out that some basic work was done prior to the change of government which of course they were able to benefit from.

         The coalition is not opposing the substance of these amendments. They are quite significant in their own right, and I support the view of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) that issues relating to the regulatory framework for superannuation are of primary importance. It is also, of course, quite relevant that the major issue of superannuation is clearly going to be a subject for continuing debate leading up to the next election. The fact that the government has appointed the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Con Sciacca, to be involved in this exercise demonstrates that it takes this matter as seriously as the opposition does. I would say to Mr Sciacca, who is not in the chamber, that I think he will find dealing with the esoterics of superannuation considerably more difficult than selling Australia Remembers.

         The existing tribunal opened in July 1994 to hear complaints about procedural fairness, with the intention that it would be exempted from hearing cases involving the interpretation of medical evidence. This was in line with the recommendation made by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation in October 1993. The concern was that the tribunal would be swamped by complaints involving conflicting medical evidence which could not be readily resolved, thereby bogging down the tribunal's progress.

         In October, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer announced that the SCT would be able to handle medical complaints from 1 May 1995, following consultations with interested parties concerning possible approaches. The coalition agreed to provide the government with this six-month period of grace. In April 1995 an agreement was reached to extend the period for a further six months, following uncertainty about the SCT powers in relation to disputes following the High Court's decision in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Others. In the light of Brandy, the bill amends the act to remove a number of grounds on which a complaint could be made which could have been construed as judicial in character. The jurisdiction of the SCT is limited by the bill to deciding whether a decision is, or was, unfair or unreasonable.

The bill also inserts a new subsection 15A(1) enabling a person who has an interest in an annuity policy to complain to the SCT that the conduct of the insurer or representative of the insurer during the sale process was unfair or unreasonable. For a long time annuities were not regarded as being part of the superannuation system but it is fair to say that that is no longer the general view. In a generic sense, annuities are certainly regarded within the industry and by consumers as part of superannuation. It is only consistent, therefore, that they should be treated in the same context.

It is quite absurd that people should be prevented from serving as chairpersons, representatives or part-time or full-time members of the SCT, especially in a context of the fact that the opposition, through my own efforts in the lower House, and in the Senate, has now put forward no fewer than four bills to remove age discrimination. Those bills have passed through the Senate and they have had their first reading in the House of Representatives but they have gone no further, because the government has refused to act on them.

         —That is very kind. In terms of the modification orders, part 29 of the SI(S) Act empowers the commissioner to grant exemptions from and to make modifications to certain provisions of the act and its regulations. This will enable the commissioner to quickly address problems as they arise and he may issue either a modification declaration or a temporary modification declaration. However, the latter will have no effect after 30 June 1996 and the subject matter of a temporary modification declaration order can only be retained after this date after it is legislated. It will be interesting to see how that applies in fact.

         There is also the question of temporary modification to declaration No. 14, which generated some concern when it was released. This declaration allows the commissioner to consider the case in favour of a person who has received a minor conviction some years previously—for example, smoking pot at university—and who would therefore be unable to become a superannuation trustee, and determine, given the minor nature of the offence and the fact that any reasonable observer would conclude that the conviction is not relevant to the likelihood of the person acting imprudently and dishonestly in the future, that the `disqualified person' provisions should be waived. We do not disagree with that. Presumably, in many cases, the punishment has fitted the crime and a person should not be held accountable indefinitely.

         On a related matter, I have, at various stages, raised the question of whether trustees should be paid. I think this is an area that needs further examination. In some cases they do receive small emoluments but overall there seems to be a tendency not to remunerate trustees except in terms of costs incurred. The problem I see is simply that we are now reaching a situation where some of the larger funds—CBUS and others—will have a million or more contributors and they will be controlling well in excess of $1 billion worth of assets.

         In many respects the question of the training of trustees, and their overall fitness to conduct the operations, will be a matter of growing importance and significance. Therefore, I think there needs to be a serious examination of the trustee codes, with particular reference to the appointment of outsiders. At the moment, it is restricted so that the trustees must be people who have a direct association with the trust. There may well be a case in the future to consider the expansion of this concept. Just as we appoint experts as directors of companies, the same principle may well have to be applied when appointing trustees of super funds.

         I turn now to the question of compliance audits. The bill requires trustees to arrange for an auditor to give the trustee a report of the operations of the fund in the approved form. This must include a statement by the auditor that the fund complies with certain provisions of the SI(S) Act and regulations. The bill enables the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to disqualify any auditor who fails to adequately and properly perform any of their SI(S) functions. The amendments also empower the commissioner to refer a matter to an auditor's professional association for appropriate disciplinary action. This amendment gives the commissioner an option, other than or in addition to a disqualification, to deal with auditors who in the commissioner's opinion have failed to carry out their duties. Relevant professional associations are also provided with a mechanism whereby they can reprimand auditors. These amendments ensure that auditors are more likely to do their job properly but, again, that remains to be seen.

         It is terribly important to emphasise the fact that, to date, fortunately, there have not been any serious failures of superannuation funds. One would be taking an extraordinary risk if one was to assume that that situation will continue indefinitely. That is why the issues of fiduciary relationship and overall compliance are of fundamental importance. One of the issues, and the SI(S) Act establishes the framework to achieve this, is the need to ensure that the regulatory framework, which is essential for public confidence in superannuation, is applied as rigorously as possible while, at the same time, it does not create unnecessary difficulties for those who have to manage superannuation funds, with all the onerous responsibilities which they carry with them.

         Those attacks by the Prime Minister lie rather strangely with statements he has made over many years with regard to the management of superannuation funds. His attack has ignored a number of fundamental truths. Superannuation fund trustees have a fiduciary duty to fund members. They are accountable for forming an investment strategy that has regard to all aspects of the particular fund. Trustees have the sole responsibility of representing member interests and, consequently, fund managers who fail to perform are—and should be—sacked. But it is essential to remember that trustees are required to invest solely for the purpose of providing a retirement benefit for fund members, and fund members only.

         Superannuation fund money is not a commodity or public asset, and there is neither a legal nor a moral right of control over superannuation assets by anyone other than fund members and their trustees.

         Any deflection therefore of superannuation investment from its primary purpose in order to achieve a social or any other worthwhile goal has the potential to negate the ability of superannuation to realise the retirement income policy objectives on which it is founded. Normal strategy is for trustees to give fund managers general directions. They invest in bonds, both domestic and overseas, in shares in Australian or overseas industries, resource stocks with a heavy emphasis on blue-chip stocks, cash for investment in the money market, and, more recently, in home mortgages.

         For example, development capital can be imprecise in terms of valuations. There can be frequent slowness in delivering financial returns in the early stages of investment. Trustees need to be reassured that this is not unusual and is still consistent with their initial expectation of superior risk adjusted returns.

         Let me give you an example of this. The largest investor company in Australia, as we know, is the AMP. It has committed $500 million to investment in infrastructure and has an additional $150 million from other funds. The AMP has also established a business development fund of $100 million to invest directly in unlisted small and medium enterprises. One can legitimately criticise $500 million or so in the overall total of the AMP's $36 billion of funds; it does seem to be rather low. Nevertheless, let us look at the breakdown of those funds. Under management the AMP has $12 billion invested in Australia equities, $3.2 billion in foreign equities, $6 billion in property, $7.3 billion in fixed interest, $1.8 billion in inflation index linked securities, $3.8 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in direct resource investments. This aggregate allocation reflects the individual asset allocation strategies applied in each of the separate funds managed by the AMP. In other words, a client can come in and explicitly say, `That is the range of investments I want,' and they can buy into a fund on that basis. Equally it follows that they have to accept the responsibility that the fund may or may not perform in accordance with expectations.

         I believe that the Prime Minister, and others who wish to speak rather loosely in this area, would do well to read the report of the private infrastructure task force, which points to the emergence of specialist infrastructure investment funds offering a spread of project risks, to the development of the inflation indexed bond market and to the first public listing of an infrastructure project, which was the M2 motorway in Sydney. Clearly there are going to be far more infrastructure projects in the future, and with all of these projects, as we understand how they operate and how they can be funded and so forth, there will be new opportunities arising both for information about them and to help trustees make decisions.

         Finally in this particular context, a report from the National Investment Council entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Financing growth
         </emphasis>
         , released in August of this year, noted that, while SMEs generate around 40 per cent of Australia's private sector output and account for about half of private employment, there are significant impediments which limit the effective flow of funds to SMEs. Rather than a shortage of capital for infrastructure investment, there is a shortage of projects which meet the hurdle rates of return and risk characteristics for suitable investments. So fundamentally we come back to that issue: can you get a better return from putting your money in blue chips, which are transferable almost at a moment's notice, or is it worth taking these additional risks in a quest for infrastructure investments and for other suitable investments?

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The report found that only about 10 per cent of SMEs aspire to significant growth and only about 30 per cent of those are willing to take external equity. Furthermore, most growth firms seeking equity are not looking for investment. They are not `investment ready'—that is, they fail to meet fundamental requirements to be attractive to external investors. For instance, they have not separated their business and personal affairs, they depend on one key individual or they have not established a sustainable market niche. Many SMEs are not aware of what is required to be investment ready. In a recent BRW article entitled `Where none but angels dare to tread'—a very appropriate title—a financier stated that the problem has little to do with money but lies with the inability of the typical owner-manager of an SME to communicate, that business plans are often ineffective and that much of what is in them cannot be delivered.

         Perhaps the point which also needs to be re-emphasised is that the evidence is quite clear that most small operators are seeking cheap borrowing capacity. They are not seeking equity. I repeat: they are not seeking equity. There needs to be a re-education at both ends of the spectrum, in terms of the SMEs so they understand that there are alternative forms of financing, including equity financing or partial equity financing, which should be looked at, as well as the issue of greater information in the hands of the trustees and the fund managers. Consequently, out of all of this, the National Investment Council recommended that SMEs must be assisted to become more investment ready.

         A study conducted by Catalyst Investment Managers Pty Ltd, an established development fund manager, which was undertaken to test the feasibility of a regionally focused investment fund that would assist the growth of some 3,500-plus small and medium sized manufacturers in the greater western suburbs of Sydney—and I am sure that the parliamentary secretary will be well aware of this—highlighted a substantial demand for capital. However—and this is a point I have just made—most of the respondents favoured non-institutional sources of capital. Only 23 per cent would consider raising equity from an institutional source. Consequently, the question has to be asked: could the government do any better?

         Three years ago the government launched the pooled development fund scheme as part of an economic package to pull the economy out of recession. Earnings from funds invested in a registered PDF would be taxed at a concessional rate, so we were told. To qualify, investment companies had to agree to invest the money they raised in small developing companies. But, sadly, it is fair to say that this scheme has not reached its expectations, nor would most people regard it as having been a success overall. The tax concession was too small and the constraints on the type of investments that PDFs could make in the scheme were clearly unattractive. Very few companies applied for PDF registration and, of those that did, many struggled to find funds.

         Let us look at some of the solutions. Rather than directing members' funds or fiddling with tax concessions and making yet more radical changes to the superannuation system, the quality and diversity of superannuation investments would improve if member choice was extended. Ian Chalmers, in a paper entitled `Yours, mine or ours?: Is there a case for directed superannuation investment?' stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Beneficiary Investment Choice provides the option for individual fund members to select investment strategies most suited to their own circumstances, preferences and longer term retirement funding objectives. Within these constraints, the availability of BIC "social investment" options, provided they satisfy the fiduciary obligations of fund trustees, may facilitate an increased flow of investment capital to public benefit projects, without undermining the inalienable right of fund members to obtain the maximum economic return from the investment of their retirement saving.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In addition, funds which do not offer BIC fail to fully accommodate the differing risk/return requirements of their members. This inevitably exposes those well short of retirement to an investment approach of unnecessary (and ultimately costly) conservatism, or alternatively, those closer to retirement to investments of inappropriate volatility.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, while accountability and reporting standards have improved, many fund members are denied the right to shift their savings from a fund with which they are dissatisfied to an alternative superannuation fund of their choice. This absence of choice prevents fund members from moving to a fund which complies with the members' particular requirements.

         —I am pleased to be able to contribute to the debate upon the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill before the House today. Superannuation is one of those issues which are very important to us all, and certainly to the broader Australian community. The bill has four main purposes, which have been well canvassed earlier by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott). Those purposes cover expanding the jurisdiction and improving the effectiveness of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal; transferring various modification orders made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner into the body of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993; requiring audits of superannuation entities to cover compliance with certain provisions of the SI(S) Act and the regulations; and making other miscellaneous amendments to the SI(S) Act, the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 and the Superannuation Entities (Taxation) Act 1987, amendments which are primarily aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of those acts and the system of prudential supervision of the superannuation industry.

         The financial impact of these proposed amendments, which totals approximately $980,000, would see the creation of a deputy chairperson and two part-time members for the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, the introduction of a new case management system and further additional resources for the tribunal. These amendments will supplement the prudentially sound regulatory framework that this Labor government has put in place over the past 12 years as part of its development of a comprehensive national superannuation scheme. Since its election in 1983, the Labor government has radically transformed retirement savings in this country to a point where the comprehensive system now in place will, in the long term, increase retirement incomes and national savings. The work of this government is something of which Australians can be very proud, and I myself am certainly pleased to be part of that process.

         Prior to 1983, as I am sure you would be well aware, superannuation was the preserve of a minority of Australians. The vast majority of Australian workers did not have access to superannuation to supplement their retirement incomes. This government, in pursuit of a fair and equitable retirement income policy for all Australians, has to a large extent remedied this situation through a number of key policy initiatives. The 1985 Accord with the ACTU played a pivotal role in this process, through a universal three per cent employer-provided superannuation benefit in lieu of an equivalent productivity based general wage rise. That is one point that is often forgotten in the superannuation debate. It was the workers themselves who actually started off their contribution with that three per cent, by forgoing a wage rise. I think we need to continue to remind some of those opposite that that contribution was made by the workers of this nation.

         The award based superannuation system, which emanated from the subsequent national wage case decision in 1986, saw access to superannuation extended from a base of 39 per cent in 1983 to one of 72 per cent of employees by July 1991. To supplement the development of award based superannuation, the government introduced in the 1991 budget the superannuation guarantee, to further extend the coverage of superannuation for employees and to ensure compliance amongst employers in meeting their superannuation obligations to employees. The combination of award based superannuation and the superannuation guarantee has increased coverage to over 90 per cent of the Australian work force as at October 1995. Indeed, by the year 2002, under the superannuation guarantee schedule of rates, workers will receive an employer superannuation support equivalent to nine per cent of their salary.

         When the honourable members opposite last sat on the Treasury bench, only 39 per cent of the work force was covered by superannuation. I think you would agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that is a damning indictment of the opposition's retirement income policy at that time. Clearly, it did not require the powers of a soothsayer to see the potential of superannuation in the future direction of retirement income and savings policy in Australia.

         In the government's 1995-96 budget, further initiatives were put in place to build upon our comprehensive retirement income and national savings plan for the future. In this context, from 1997, variations to awards will see the introduction of employee contributions to superannuation paid out of future wage rises. Contributions amounting to three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings will be phased in over three years. This phasing-in period will reduce undue pressure on wages and cost and should see no discernible reduction in disposable income.

         To complement the three per cent phased employee superannuation contributions, the government will match, dollar for dollar, employee contributions with direct payments to workers' superannuation accounts, by paying the second round of the One Nation tax cuts in this form. The matching payments will be capped at three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings, and a means test will gradually withdraw support to the salary in the range of up to $65,000 per annum. Consequently, by the year 2000, it is estimated that the government will be paying around $4.5 billion per year into the superannuation accounts of workers. By the year 2020, the government's superannuation plan will add $18 billion each year to the national savings. In this context, employees will be saving 15 per cent of their salary through superannuation contributions, which will result in higher retirement incomes in the long term and will certainly ensure that Australians are assured of a sound retirement—something that we all aim for in our later years.

         At the present time, the Australian superannuation industry has assets of approximately $190 billion. This savings pool is a basis for the future expansion of this nation's economy, which will be critical if we are going to be able to compete in the international marketplace. We are all well aware of this government's commitment to that end, and certainly of the efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) over the last week or so to ensure Australia's place, particularly in our own region, in an international marketplace. Over the next five years, by the year 2001, the combined effect of all the government's superannuation measures to date will boost national savings by an estimated two per cent of GDP, or $8.2 billion. It is estimated that the savings impact of superannuation by the year 2006 will be approximately $12.4 billion, or three per cent of GDP and, by the year 2021, four per cent of GDP, which will be $16.6 billion.

         Under the government's current policy settings, superannuation assets are projected to increase tenfold in the next 25 years. This is a substantial savings pool in anybody's language. With workers' hard-earned savings being invested by superannuation funds to secure increased returns on their retirement savings, the government has, as I said earlier, put in place the regulatory framework to ensure that the funds operate in a prudentially sound manner. To this end, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill, which is before the House today, will add to the overall effectiveness of the legislation already enacted by this parliament.

Under the new amendments, key enhancements to audit requirements will provide for copies of audit certificates, rather than originals, to be provided to the commissioner when an annual return is lodged; for a statement of cash flows to be prepared for superannuation entities to allow auditors' reports to relate to more than the accounts and statements currently referred to in part 13; for the auditor's report to include the auditor's opinion on the compliance of the entity with specified provisions of the act and the regulations; and for clarification of the circumstances in which an auditor may be disqualified and in which an auditor or actuary must tell the trustee that they believe there is a contravention of the act or that the financial position of the entity is, or may become, unsatisfactory.

Supplementing these changes to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the bill before the House today will also make a number of important amendments to the operation of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, which of course was put in place by the government to deal with complaints about the operation of the superannuation industry in a fair and equitable manner.

Indeed, if we believe what the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has been saying in recent weeks, it would now seem that even the opposition parties have finally seen the light and are supportive of the government's superannuation policies.

I have seen enough reports in the media over recent weeks to make me wonder whether they are really fair dinkum about what they are saying. I wonder whether they have really seen the light after all or whether it is just a cynical attempt to disguise a more sinister set of policies which would seek to dismantle the comprehensive national savings system we have put in place.

         Australia has seen before what the coalition has managed to do when it talks about not dismantling things. Go back to the days of the Fraser government. Look what they promised about Medicare in those days. Have they got the same thing in mind for superannuation? Given the coalition's previous track record, the second of these scenarios would seem more likely. Indeed, if you look at the superannuation proposals floated by the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the member for Higgins in relation to allowing the banks to directly compete in the superannuation marketplace, the effects upon the comprehensive system already in place would be deleterious to say the least.

If the coalition were, unfortunately for the Australian people, ever to get hold of the Treasury bench again, then the criticisms that have come forward from a lot of the commentators about that would be quite interesting. On face value the proposals sound very nice and sound a very easy way to operate, but on close analysis it is seen that they really are flawed, and very much so.

         I turn quickly to the other points the coalition was talking about in regard to allowing banks into superannuation. At first glance, that makes a lot of sense too but, on the other side of the coin, banks are already into that field through their own subsidiaries and there is no real need to go down that path. If those sorts of funds were in the banking system, they would all be subject to the normal bank lending criteria and they would not come under the control that is offered by the protection of the superannuation industry that we are debating today, a protection further enhancing the safety of members' funds.

        When the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) was speaking earlier about his amendment, which I reject out of hand and I know the government does as well, he chose to attack the Prime Minister for trying to encourage some fund managers to invest more wisely in this country. The honourable member's suggestion that it is the members' funds that we should be considering really makes a joke of what he is saying in his amendment because the risk is found in the opposition's own proposed policies. It is important that funds are invested and that the risk is spread. That is what the Prime Minister has been trying to encourage a lot of Australian investors to do.

         —I will refer to only one matter raised by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), that is, where he referred to Mr Noel Whittaker's column. One thing to remember about Mr Whittaker is that he is a professional adviser whose income derives from advising people how to invest their funds. If RSAs became part of the total retirement income scheme of things, Mr Whittaker would not be in a position to make much money out of them. He said in his column that RSAs were to be deplored and he gave an interesting example. He quoted a return of four per cent on an RSA and compared that with nine per cent in a super fund. Blind Freddy knows that if you are going to get four per cent on an RSA it is not going to match nine per cent in a super fund, except that, if you look at the super funds these days, they are not returning four per cent after Labor's up-front 15 per cent tax. They are going backwards in many cases and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) knows it. I have recorded some typical examples in

         The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill was introduced into the chamber on 19 October, 1995. It sets out to amend four principal acts, namely the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act of 1993, the SI(S) Act, the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, the S(RC) Act, the Superannuation Entities (Taxation) Act 1987, the SE(T) Act, the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1995.

         As the explanatory memorandum points out, the bill has four main aims. The first of those is to expand the jurisdiction and improve the effectiveness of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The second involves the transfer of various modification orders made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, briefly known as the commissioner in my later remarks, into the body of the SI(S) Act. Then come the provisions which intend to require audits of the superannuation entities to cover compliance with certain provisions of the SI(S) Act and the regulations and, fourth and last, provision to make other miscellaneous amendments to the SI(S) Act, the S(RC) Act and the SE(T) Act, primarily aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of those acts and the system of prudential supervision of the superannuation industry.

         We are told the financial impact of the bill will result in an increase in outlays of approximately $1 million. The proposed amendments provide for the creation of a deputy chairperson and two part-time members of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. In a full year the cost of these positions is estimated to be about $270,000 of which about $223,000 will be for salary or in the form of salary related costs.

         Also, we are informed, a resource bill will, as required, be brought forward for consultation with the Department of Finance in the additional estimates progress. The full year costs of this bid are expected to be of the order of $500,000, of which $340,000 would be for salary or for salary related expenditure. Further one-off costs, including a new case management system, would add a further $210,000.

         Clause 42 of schedule 4 of the bill requires trustees to arrange for an auditor to give the trustee a report of the operations of the fund in an approved form. An approved form must include a statement by the auditor that the fund complies with certain provisions of the SI(S) Act and regulations.

         A trustee who intentionally or recklessly fails to make the necessary amendments will become liable to a penalty of up to two years imprisonment.

Clauses 65 and 66 of schedule 4 of the bill enable the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to disqualify any auditor who fails to adequately and properly perform any of their assigned SIS functions.

         The amendments also empower the commissioner to refer a matter to an auditors' professional association for appropriate disciplinary action. I would have thought that, rather than prison terms, that might have been the best way to go. But these amendments aim to ensure that auditors are more likely to do their job properly, I suppose—and so they should. I would have thought that auditors would be professional enough to meet their obligations and perform audits in a professional manner which meets the requirements of the SI(S) Act without the threat of penalties, including imprisonment. However, this amendment should provide a bit of stick to ensure that auditors do meet their obligations.

         Part 29 of the SI(S) Act empowers the commissioner to grant exemptions from and make modifications of certain provisions of the act and its regulations. This power enables the commissioner to quickly address problems as they arise. The commissioner may issue either a modification declaration or a temporary modification declaration. However, I understand that the latter will have no effect after 30 June 1996. The subject matter of a temporary modification declaration order can only be retained after 30 June 1996 if it is legislated.

         Incorporating these declarations within the act also provides an opportunity for me to comment on the subject matter. For the S(RC) Act, the amendments expand the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, the SCT, to consider medical evidence if the decision to which the complaint relates was made on or after 1 November 1994. Previously there was a concern that the SCT would be swamped by complex conflicting medical opinion, which would be difficult to resolve. A regulation was drafted to limit the hearing of medical disputes by the SCT, but this was disallowed in the Senate in September last year. It was disallowed, I understand, because it was felt that people with disabilities should have access to a low cost dispute mechanism.

         The government changed its position in October 1994 to allow the SCT to be able to handle medical complaints from 1 May 1995, following consultations with interested parties about possible approaches. However, this matter was thrown into some confusion after the High Court ruled on the Brandy case. The Brandy decision has had only a very minimal impact on the operations of the SCT because, unlike the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the HREOC, the SCT does not have enforcement powers, nor does it set out to usurp judicial powers. It is hard to believe that the powers of the HREOC remained unchallenged for so long. It is very clear that the Boilermakers case of 1956 set a precedent, and led to the splitting of the Arbitration and Conciliation Court into the Arbitration Commission, now the IRC, and the industrial division of the Federal Court, now the Industrial Relations Court.

         The High Court held in its Brandy decision that judicial power is to be only exercised by courts and bodies established and constituted under the constitution. The nub of judicial power is that it involves the determination of existing rights. It is not, however, an exercise of judicial power to create new rights. There is a potential jurisdictional problem with the SCT, so this bill amends section 14(2) of the S(RC) Act to remove `in excess of the powers of the trustee' and `was an improper exercise of the powers of the trustee' as grounds on which a complaint may be made to the SCT.

         In October 1994, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer indicated that legislation would be expedited to ensure the SCT had jurisdiction to deal with complaints involving life insurance superannuation products. The bill inserts a new subsection 14A(1), which enables a person who has an interest in a life policy fund to complain to the SCT that the decision of the trustee to admit the person to the fund was unfair or unreasonable.

         This has the effect of allowing people who have suffered misconduct, such as misrepresentation from life office agents, to obtain redress.

Their products are not sold by agents, but are usually sold by independent financial planners of the ilk of the columnist to whom I referred earlier. This effectively means that any amendment to extend coverage of the SCT to other financial organisations will need further, wide ranging amendments.

That seems to be in breach of what we understand to be the anti-discrimination objectives shared by both sides of the parliament. As far as I am concerned, this age discrimination should be removed from the bill.

To some degree, the Prime Minister is right. It is a fact that the superannuation funds charge too much by way of charges and fees. Their outlook is too short.

But, just as importantly, it is this government which has created the environment in which the super funds operate. It is this government which has constantly changed the regulatory framework that the super funds have had to keep pace with.

         —I am very pleased to participate in the debate on the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, because there have been numerous amendments made by the government to superannuation over a long period of time and it is getting quite irritating for the opposition to have an endless, seemingly unconnected series of decisions made on superannuation.

         The fact that discretionary savings are falling and savings are being pushed, in a non-discretionary way, into compulsory savings processes is something that many Australians resent. It has brought about a situation wherein the savings and superannuation policy of this government has reduced national savings from 24.1 per cent—the rate when they came to office—to 16.3 per cent. They have driven down, in fact, the commitments made to savings by our fellow Australians.

         The lack of confidence in markets has been, perhaps, a reason for it. The behaviour of some of our `entrepreneurs' may be another reason. But I suspect that the real reason is a lack of confidence in the whole process of superannuation, and that it is a lack of confidence in Australia's future that is discouraging people from saving.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is a further factor. It is the psychological impact of a compulsory superannuation system whereby people are compelled to save or their employers are compelled to save for them. People think that that is enough. They think they have done enough: `Whatever the government requires is enough savings for us. We have got a compulsory process in place and, therefore, we do not have to make any additional effort.'

         On top of that is the appalling mismanagement of the whole economy that the government has shown. That really has put so much pressure on Australian families that not only do they have less disposable income, but they also have greatly diminished discretionary savings.

         So it is a combination of the poorly managed economy, uncertainty about jobs and uncertainty about commitments to flexible payouts such as mortgage rates on housing—where we have seen, over the last two or three years, people suddenly hit for huge increases in their weekly payouts to keep their mortgages covered. It is all of those things: the unexpected rises in mortgage rates, the compulsory savings program of the government through superannuation, the lack of certainty about Australia's future, and the inclination of Australians to not save when there is such strong economic pressure on them and such uncertainty about their own futures and the futures of their family members in regard to employment and employment opportunities.

         To look at the underlying factors that have produced this process, one has only to look at the government's inflationary policy, which is very hard to assess and predict. The government's inflationary policy was supposed to retain inflation in the band of two to three per cent. It is over that right now; in real terms it is 3.1 per cent. Underlying inflation has hit 3.1 per cent and the headline rate is now 5.1 per cent. So there is a discouragement, straight away, because the cost of living is going ahead of the pace at which people can keep up.

         At the same time, the government has no monetary policies that would encourage a belief that there is going to be a fall in interest rates. In fact, the International Monetary Fund has said to the government, `Do not dare manipulate interest rates down before the next election.' Now, to my knowledge, that is the first time the International Monetary Fund has come in and given a directive to an Australian government. The fund has made the comment that we should not reduce interest rates, artificially or in any other way, before an election unless there are the economic circumstances that will force interest rates down. I think it is a tragedy that we have this international body starting now to intervene in the Australian economy. It is all the work of the Australian Labor Party and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The next step, of course, if there is increased certainty, will be that they will take over the total management of the economy.

         So the uncertainty of the fall in interest rates produced by the government's monetary policy is something that is of deep concern to many Australians. Most Australians do not understand the Labor Party's tax policy. They do not know what they are going to be hit for next because this has been a government of big grabs in taxation. This has been the government that has said, `We are not going to have a goods and services tax,' but which, as soon as it could possibly do it, after the last elections, instigated a widespread, far-reaching wholesale sales tax which bumped up the price of goods and services. It is built into nearly everything. It is built into transport, packaging and the whole box and dice. In fact, food is taxed currently.

         The spread and the change in taxation, and the uncertainty in the taxation policy, are factors that are working against the community's preference to save. There is no micro-economic reform policy that is worth thinking about. It does not affect many people but it does mean that the built in costs and the overheads of day-to-day living are not declining, but increasing. All of these factors, which are built into the government's assessment of the economy, have worked to have the government rely solely on the superannuation industry for its method of creating a savings environment in Australia. It is far too narrow.

         No person in Australia would know more about superannuation policy and savings policy than my colleague the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). He has put much of his time in parliament into the development of policies. It is a privilege to pay tribute to the work that he has done. The government keeps picking up the ideas of my colleague but, at this point, it is about five years behind him.

         —And I know that Mr Deputy Speaker does also, but I cannot speak for him. The fact is that, as we are well aware, the government's processes, its whole policy framework and its whole attitude towards superannuation have proved disastrous for many Australians. Let me reiterate that the massive decline in savings has meant that the government has borrowed overseas, and then, when it was criticised for that, it got more into the Australian market and borrowed more expensive money from Australia, but a smaller amount is available because much of it is no longer saved. The government is forcing up interest rates on the Australian domestic market because of the money that it needs to borrow. Everything that this government does seems to work against its proposals for savings. It goes and sticks taxes on top of something that it is trying to encourage. I think it is the weirdest thing the government has ever done. We are going to have a positive program of encouraging people to save—

         —As my colleague says, it makes the poor poorer, then it goes and taxes them. It forces them to save and then it goes and taxes them for saving. There are itinerant fruit pickers and some other itinerant workers—TAFE teachers are a classic—working for short periods at different times through the week or through the year, depending on the course. Compulsory savings are going out of their super. You do not know what to do because those small amounts decline by the imposition of taxation and charges made by superannuation funds. Eventually, of course, the people involved notionally finish up owing the superannuation funds money for looking after their accounts.

         My colleague the member for Bradfield has got some great processes to overcome that. He has enunciated them. I just happen to have in front of me a speech made by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), in which he talks about the processes that can be used for these small amounts, particularly for women who may have an intermittent work history. He talks about retirement savings accounts. I think it is a real innovation and is something that Australians will welcome, where they can add into the same account successive amounts. In contrast with the current system, the money does not have to be directed into a multiplicity of funds all over the countryside so that when a person finishes their working life, maybe after 40 years work, they cannot even remember who was responsible for deducting their first compulsory superannuation. They do not know what fund they stuck that into. They can hardly remember what job they were doing at the time. You have got these scattered funds being used up by superannuation funds all over the country, of no benefit to anybody and certainly not meeting the government's objectives as far as retirement is concerned.

         We have got this alternative and it is going to be something that I think is going to warm the hearts of many Australians. It is sensible, it is modest, it gives them an advantage and it allows them to set funds aside over a long period of time for their retirement. It is something like a bank account rather than a superannuation fund in the strict sense, but the concessions are there and the opportunities are there. It is going to provide incentive for people to save, unlike what the government is doing.

I have never heard anything so ridiculous. Most people that I know, especially in the small business community around western Sydney, generally have a good relationship with the tax office, but occasionally there are problems. I do not think there is any more disliked group in our community than tax officers applying the rigours of the law over-enthusiastically. That is the image that the Australian community tends to have of people in the Australian Taxation Office, as people who are rigorous in the application of the law, people who are relentless in pursuing the government's dollars, people who have a charge direct from the Prime Minister to rip out of the community every dollar that they can possibly get.

         To think of that group of people as being kindly disposed towards savers, kindly disposed towards understanding the money markets and investment and kindly disposed towards the ultimate retirement of people is absolutely unlikely, because it is the government's own proposal that on retirement you are taxing the superannuation funds. That never used to happen but you are doing it. I am not saying that we are going to remove it—you are so far down the track into taxing things that it is very difficult for an incoming government to make too many changes to unscramble the massive grab for money that you guys have gone into.

         I have spoken in general terms on superannuation but I would just like to spend a little time covering the specific legislation. The superannuation industry has expressed its comments about the jurisdiction to hear superannuation complaints involving all intermediaries, including life brokers and their representatives and security dealers and their proper authority holders. The industry recognises that there need to be some changes to supervision processes, but we understand that there is no clear-cut view. I think the attitude here is that nobody likes increased rigour in supervision but, if there is a reasonable argument, let us try it. But the government needs to be flexible enough to wind back the supervisory processes if they are too onerous.

         The main purposes of this legislation are to expand the jurisdiction and improve the effectiveness of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. I guess that is reasonable in that there are a lot of complaints about the performance of funds, and I understand that. But with increased flexibility in retirement packages being offered and a greater range of opportunity for retirement savings, I think some of these complaints will vanish as people start to select the type of retirement package that best suits their circumstances, whether they be male or female, full-time or part-time worker, salary or wage earner. The government has failed to do that because it has a prescriptive approach. It is the coalition's view that, provided people are saving for their retirement,  as we offer more flexibility the complaints that we currently see against funds will tend to diminish.

         It is often interesting that people, from time to time, when talking about retirement income policies, turn to what is happening in Singapore with the Central Provident Fund, where quite large percentages of income are placed in a superannuation type fund. For contributions for workers up to 55 years, it is 40 per cent—20 per cent contributed by the employee and 20 per cent by the employer. This is a large pool of money.

         I will admit that I do not shy away from saying that government should intervene where appropriate. I am quite happy to be labelled an interventionist. It continually saddens me that, when we talk about whether governments should get involved in investment schemes, from time to time the performance of the Victorian state government is raised in connection with this debate.

         There were many things that happened during that era in Victoria that should not have happened, but there were many great successes. Some of those successes include organisations such as AMRAD. With the number of medical institutions and Victorian universities that were involved in biotechnology, the Victorian Labor government of the time wondered why it was that, when any of these ideas were to be developed, such institutes had to go offshore. So it decided to set up a mechanism to ensure that those things could be developed onshore for the benefit of Australia.

        In many cases, trustees retain fund managers to invest superannuation money. The government considers that fund managers need to find ways to invest in a broader range of businesses, rather than concentrating their equity investments on blue-chip stocks. For example, fund managers should consider placing a portion of their investments in small, innovative businesses. This will potentially yield better returns for investors, as well as contributing to the economic wellbeing of all Australians.

         The second matter I flagged that I wished to raise concerns some of the real problems that we might have with inequity of the present system. I refer to a paper by Alison McClelland and Peter Davidson from the Brotherhood of St Laurence who have raised a number of the matters that I have had some concern with over a long time. I think that these are things that, as we continue to develop our superannuation policy, we should keep having a look at so that we can best direct a successful superannuation system over time. In their paper, they said:

        . . . there can be little doubt that the compulsory superannuation, at the point of contribution, will have a greater adverse impact on the disposable incomes of low income earners than on those earning above average incomes. Low income earners are much less likely to be saving through superannuation already and  much more likely to need all their income for current expenditure.

         I have spoken also in the past about the way we deal with the taxation of contributions—that it does give higher income earners a greater deal of benefit than it does at the lower end. As I said, I support the compulsory superannuation scheme because it has given greater access to superannuation to lower income earners and it is an entree into the system. But as the amounts of money that are being put into the funds on behalf of individuals become greater, perhaps we will have to look at some of the options that are displayed in some of the overseas schemes.

         Yesterday in his speech to the trustees, Minister Sciacca went to the notion that is being revisited by the coalition that perhaps we could open up some of the individuals' superannuation funds to be used for housing deposits. As Minister Sciacca said, this is something that the government had a look at and has decided not to proceed with. He quite rightly indicated in his speech that—if you use the example of Singapore again—because there is a combined 40 per cent contribution between the employer and employee in Singapore it allows workers to draw on super for housing deposits, education, top-up parental retirement incomes and the like.

         Whilst rejecting them at this stage on the basis, as the minister has put it, that we are really talking about chalk and cheese in the size of the funds, these are something that McClelland and Davidson have talked about in their paper and described as `life cycle' savings. Now that has some element of the Singapore scheme in that there is a guaranteed part of their provident fund pool that is set aside most definitely for the retirement income aspects, but there are other parts of the pool that allow use of the funds by the individuals and the families for housing, for the education of their children, for topping up their parents' retirement income and for investing in other forms of investment—some forms of shares, et cetera—to top up their potential retirement income.

         It may be, as our superannuation scheme develops, and as we have large amounts being set aside for individuals, that we recognise that there are differing pressures on families at different stages of the families' development and that we could, as the amounts of money involved get larger, in a sense, be able to give alternatives for the families. As has been said often, we are talking at the moment about very small amounts. To toy with giving these choices that would allow the families to move these small amounts in and out would not mean that the totality of the overall funds would not continue to grow and continue to be of a size such that we can make worthy investments on a national scale.

         The changes were announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 13 July 1995, in his words `to provide greater scope for restructuring of projects while retaining eligibility for the development allowance'. The Treasurer estimated that the amendments would boost investment figures further, allowing additional projects of at least $1.8 billion to be eligible for the allowance. The bill allows the transfer of the development allowance benefit where ownership is transferred to a new entity after application for the allowance, or from one entity structure to another type of entity structure after registration but before pre-qualification for the allowance.

         The amendments allow project restructures both before and after registration of any type of ownership structure to any other type of ownership structure, provided the new owners and project continue to meet the conditions of eligibility. Under the current legislation, where, for example, a single entity is replaced by a joint venture, the applicants cannot transfer the benefits of the application to the new structure. A result of the amendments is that any applications for registration of plant expenditure that were refused or granted in respect of an amount of expenditure that was less than the amount of expenditure whose registration was sought in the application may be granted in full if the amendments had been in force when the principal act received royal assent.

         The purpose of this bill is to amend the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 so as to allow certain projects to be restructured to be eligible for the development allowance. The amendments also have a retrospective element allowing them to operate as from 1 January 1993. The amendments will remove certain restrictions on access to the development allowance in terms of the ownership of the project. At the present time, the benefit of the development allowance cannot be transferred in some cases where ownership of a project is also transferred following a commercial restructure. In other words, a single owner could not transfer the project to a joint venture or a joint venture could not transfer the project to a single owner and still be eligible for the development allowance.

         The government, after being approached by various industry groups that argued that this measure was causing difficulties because, for commercial and technical reasons, it might be necessary to restructure a project during its development stage, commissioned a review by the Development Allowance Authority, the Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury, and the results are to amend the legislation to provide more scope for the restructure of a project during development and its still being eligible for the development allowance.

         One of the government's goals has always been to strengthen business investment so that we could underpin strong but sustainable economic growth. In 1994-95 business investment grew by an outstanding 16 per cent. Business investment has been at this level because interest rates have fallen and there is a downward pressure on them. Inflation is at historically low levels, below five per cent for almost four years, and will remain low. Company profits are at an all-time high and continue to grow strongly. Business confidence has also picked up and remains high.

         I also make the point, notwithstanding the events with the CRA dispute over the last days, that cooperative industrial relations has contributed significantly to the increase of business investment in Australia. Business investment is also growing strongly because the taxation system encouraged productive investment. The government has established considerable taxation concessions for business which include accelerated depreciation, the general investment allowance, this development allowance, infrastructure bonds, and research and development concessions.

         It is also worth mentioning that the government has reduced the rate of company taxation to 36 per cent, which is significantly lower than when the opposition occupied the Treasury bench. Together, all of the taxation concessions I have mentioned will provide business in Australia with a benefit of approximately $3 billion in 1995-96. The cost of these amendments alone will be $10 million per year and the total cost over the nine years from 1993-94 to 2001-02 is expected to be about $92 million.

         The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the introduction of a development allowance in the One Nation statement on 26 February 1992. The development allowance provides for a taxation deduction of 10 per cent of the capital expenditure incurred on the acquisition or lease of new plant or equipment for projects with capital expenditure of $50 million or more. I know that there has been some discussion about whether it should have been lower than $50 million or not, but that is the figure that they have settled on. The introduction of the development allowance encouraged investment in large projects, stimulated micro-economic reform and encouraged international competitiveness.

So far, 270 of these projects, involving some $75 billion in capital expenditure, have been registered. Of these, 31 projects have been approved, involving expenditure of over $6 billion.

         One of these projects approved for the development allowance, as I mentioned earlier, was BHP for its No. 6 blast furnace at the Port Kembla steelworks. This is the first BHP project to fulfil the requirements of the Development Allowance Authority's `competitiveness test'. The No. 6 blast furnace is an over-$400 million project which involved more than 3,000 people, mostly from the Illawarra, to work at various times throughout the construction phases of the project. The current peak construction work force is approximately 900 people.

         Once the No. 6 blast furnace is commissioned in March next year, the two smaller existing furnaces, No. 4 and No. 2, will be decommissioned. The result will be increased efficiency and increased capacity which is required in the supply of steel to export markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The new No. 6 blast furnace will lead the world in metal quality, productivity and environmental controls. High levels of automation and mechanical aids will significantly improve working conditions, increase efficiency and safety, and minimise repetitive intensive workloads.

         If there is one area that really needs to be carefully examined in workplaces it is safety, accidents and injury. The New South Wales government is again revisiting the issue of workers compensation and there are a few unsavoury points which I view with concern. But the real message is that, rather than attack workers compensation entitlements, workplaces need to be made safer places for workers. It is therefore disappointing that the New South Wales government has appointed former Premier Barry Unsworth to the New South Wales Work Cover Authority to oversee various proposals for change which, if one relies on media reports, will again attack workers compensation entitlements—as he did in 1988. My union colleagues have expressed concern to me that, given the former Premier's inability to listen to arguments on this issue in 1988, he will go much further this time in his new position.

         I also want to mention the contribution of the Illawarra's combined trade unions and BHP's work force. The competitiveness test, as set out in the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992, requires applicants for the development allowance to demonstrate that their labour relations substantially reflect world best practice. The Illawarra has always been portrayed as a union town. It is a union town and it will always be one. It is also leading the way in workplace relationships, and that was recognised recently when a report by the regional development taskforce was tabled.

        This bill will make changes to the youth training allowance provisions of the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. Late last year these provisions were incorporated into part 8 of the act and modelled on those for jobsearch allowance found in the Social Security Act 1991. As the youth training allowance and jobsearch allowance are closely aligned, it is important that any changes to one are mirrored in the other and  commence at or about the same time.

         The youth training allowance is just one part of the youth training initiative. To those leaving school early, the youth training initiative offers more than an income support payment. It offers case management, training and jobs. Young people who leave school at the end of this school year can be eligible for this assistance, not six months or a year down the track but at the same time as their former classmates are beginning a new year of school.

         Young people now realise that if they want to have a good, well paid job they need to stay on at school, look for an apprenticeship or a traineeship, or pursue further vocational training. Jobs that are full time, well paid and stable increasingly require education, training and skills. If we are to help early school leavers who are unemployed, we need to give them the training and skills that will open the doors to full-time quality jobs.

         Early access to training, education and work experience opportunities is vital for early school leavers. Young people who enter the labour market without post-secondary qualifications or work experience find it difficult to get full-time permanent jobs. Skills, qualifications and experience are more important now than at any time in the past. The youth training initiative offers a way out of the no job, no experience, no qualifications trap.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, the first thing that needs to be said about this piece of legislation is that it is yet another bill which has had to be introduced into the parliament because of the decision by the government to take over the youth training allowance or to invent a new payment, the youth training allowance, which substitutes for jobsearch in relation to young people and to assume control over this allowance from the Department of Social Security.

         The reason for this has never been adequately explained. The necessity for it has never been adequately justified. Consequently, a great deal of new legislation is required simply to mirror provisions in social security legislation. In other words, the parliament is being put to a great deal of extra work solely to gratify, apparently, the imperial ambitions of the Department of Employment, Education and Training to have under its control the payment of a significant allowance.

         The second thing that should be said about this legislation is that, as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has pointed out, it is part of the government's youth training initiative. The whole purpose of the measures for youth in the white paper Working Nation as set out by the government, was to assist unemployed youth get back into employment and particularly to assist long-term unemployed youth to get back into employment.

         The people of Australia will be asking at this stage, almost 17 months since the commencement of the Working Nation program, whether this youth training initiative has been effective. They will be asking, `What is now the position of young people in Australia as a result of the measures brought down by the government?' The answer is a very sorry answer indeed. Any reference to the official statistics will reveal the fact that youth unemployment in Australia is now higher than it was when Working Nation commenced operation. Not only has the youth training initiative failed to bring down unemployment amongst young people but teenage unemployment has actually increased since Working Nation began. The very age group which is the recipient of the youth training allowance and the supposed beneficiary of the youth training initiative is in more dire straits now than it was when Working Nation commenced.

         This is an incredible failure on the part of the government and it needs to be brought firmly into the public limelight because there is no doubt that youth unemployment is one of the most serious social and economic problems which Australia faces today. It has not escaped the attention even of certain media proprietors that this has become a major area of failure by the government. People will want to know why it is that Working Nation has failed young Australians so comprehensively.

         The government, of course, does not want people to focus on this issue at all. It will be a matter of continuing shame that the minister has directed his department to cease the publication of the regional youth unemployment statistics, which were readily available to all members of parliament until the last publication—and then the chopper came down. We are getting too close to an election, Mr Deputy Speaker, for these statistics to be allowed to continue to come out in the public domain.

He came very close to misleading the parliament when a question was asked of him in question time. He said, `Oh, these statistics are still available. All you have to do is to go over to the Bureau of Statistics and they will draw them out for you.'

         We have a government whose programs have failed and which has tried to suppress information which might give clear evidence of the extent of that failure and the large number of areas of regional Australia suffering rates of youth unemployment of over 50 per cent. The national rate of youth unemployment—that is, unemployment amongst teenagers looking for full-time work, which is the commonly accepted measure of youth unemployment—is 29 per cent. But the figures that were released before the chopper came down, before the censorship was imposed, showed that in a number of areas of regional Australia youth unemployment was well over 50 per cent. In some places, such as in inner and western Melbourne, it was over 60 per cent. And the total unemployment rate in these areas—the overall unemployment rate—was over 20 per cent.

         I can hardly refrain from saying that these areas where unemployment is so high are areas which have been represented for a long time typically by the Labor Party. If you travel to these areas and see the social desolation that the policies of this government has caused with these incredible unemployment rates, with young people clustered around the pinball parlours or in the foyers of overcrowded magistrates courts, you cannot help asking yourself how it is that this party has failed its constituency so comprehensively. What have the members been doing over more than a decade in power? What have they been doing over the last 13 years when they have been in government? Where are the great efforts they have been making to bring industry and jobs to these areas, to their constituents? Where are the policies that will encourage small business in these areas to employ people? Where are the effective regional employment programs that might have a chance of alleviating this appalling scene? They are not there.

         What do these Labor members say when they go back to their constituents? They say, `Watch out for the coalition because they will take away your welfare benefits. We have put you all on welfare, sure. But that is even better than a coalition government could do.' They mislead their constituents remorselessly. Indeed, you can see why so many Australians have become cynical about politics and about the Labor Party, and why they say, `Well, really, the Labor Party is the party of poverty.' It is because the Labor Party's principal electoral tactic is to first of all push their constituents into poverty and then frighten them that they will lose their benefits if they change government—if they change to a government which has a magnificent historical record of creating employment right across the Australian community.

         It is a fact that many, many thousands of these unemployed young Australians would give their right arm to have an apprenticeship or a traineeship that will lead them into employment. They would love to have that opportunity. I was at a dinner only a couple of weeks ago, put on by the council of the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association. The chairman of that association told the guests at the dinner that his company had recently advertised some 30 apprenticeship vacancies. They got over 900 applications for these 30 apprenticeships.

         If we look at these opportunities, it is obvious that there are not nearly enough opportunities for young people who want them.

Look at the increases in commencements.' What they do not tell you—and this is just a simple matter of statistical propriety—is that we have to look at these figures in the context of the size of the work force. Of course, the number has gone up! The work force has increased; the population is growing. There are probably a hundred times the number in traineeships than there were in apprenticeships back in the 1920s—but what does that mean? As a proportion of the work force, the number of opportunities is the lowest for three decades. That is what matters to those young people who are clamouring for these opportunities.

         The government says, `You know that we have given a tremendous emphasis to training over the last 13 years. No government has thought more about training.' We go back to the origins of the Australian traineeship system in 1985, when there were big ambitions to add to the apprenticeships available. It was intended to have an enormous number of new traineeships. Indeed the target at the time was 75,000 commencements in traineeships a year. What happened? The figure never got above 15,000. Mostly, it did not get above 9,000.

They managed 16,000 in the first year. What a pathetic performance!

         Go around this country, as I am sure the minister does and as I do, and talk to small businesses and chambers of commerce and ask them why they are not taking on apprentices and trainees. The answer comes through, loud and clear: the government's scheme is so complex, so difficult to understand and so embedded in the industrial relations system. This last has been the great problem with it, and the real reason is that, for the last 13 years, there has not genuinely been an agenda to create training opportunities for young Australians. There has been an agenda to make sure that whatever training opportunities are created do not interfere with the centralised award system so beloved of the ACTU.

It has been designed to preserve their position, and young Australians have been betrayed for, and sacrificed to, the preservation of those interests.

         The gulf between reality and rhetoric has been colossal under this government. It is no wonder that we find youth unemployment so high. There is a very significant proportion—not a majority, but a significant proportion—of young people, perhaps 25 per cent of the senior secondary group and of 19-year-olds, who want workplace based training and who do not intend to go on through TAFE or university.

But then they were not the slightest bit interested in TAFE or the colleges of advanced education, or in vocational education. No! Everyone had to go on to universities. Why did the government adopt that policy? Was that their deep and abiding concern for young Australians? Of course not. The reason they adopted the policy of destroying those vocationally oriented institutions was because the unions wanted to have the same employment conditions and the same salary conditions as university staff had. The whole tertiary education and training system was up-ended again to suit the interests of the government's mates in the unions, and young people once again were sacrificed.

         One of the most destructive things that Working Nation did in its first year of implementation was to require young people just out of school and looking for jobs to wait around for 12 months until they were long-term unemployed before they qualified for assistance under Working Nation. Working Nation promised that 189,000 of them, mainly young people, would get subsidised employment assistance through the jobstart program.

         What did it achieve? It undershot that target by 94,000. Why did it do that? Not for the reasons the minister gives in explaining that incredible bungle—that employers prefer employees who have been through the training programs. It is plausible. The only problem was that the training programs he is referring to have lower employment outcomes than the jobstart program. If employers prefer it, why are the employment outcomes lower? That is not the reason. The reason is that there was an extraordinary bungle and they choked off the program that had the most employment outcomes. That was the best guarantee of getting a job, and 94,000 unemployed young people suffered as a result of that.

He knew this a year before he changed the entry guidelines into the program and did nothing because, like Carmen Lawrence, I suppose, he was too proud to ever admit a mistake.

You have not effectively offered any help to young people, because the problem is getting worse, growth is slowing and jobs are scarcer under your policies.
