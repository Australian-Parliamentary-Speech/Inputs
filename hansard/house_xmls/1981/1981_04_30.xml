       To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans-Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans-Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines would inevitably result in:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) the creation of a private monopoly of major airline services in Australia;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) higher domestic air fares.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright any proposal to sell Trans-Australia Airlines.

      <para>
       (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic material from falling into private hands.
      </para>
      <para>

Will the same taxpayers lose about $300 in the same year by the abolition of even half tax indexation?

I take the opportunity to repeat that the benefits of half tax indexation, which will be worth about $500m by way of tax remissions, will be available from 1 July as promised in the Prime Minister's policy speech. The question of what other tax arrangements will prevail in 1981-82 and subsequent financial years will, of course, be determined on a discretionary basis, normally in the context of the preparation of future budgets. It ought not to be assumed that the decision made by the Government not to continue half tax in- dexation after the coming financial year necessarily implies a less beneficial taxation treatment of Australian families in future years.

Having regard to that, I would expect him to support in this House any efforts that this Government might make to increase the opportunities for the establishment of industry unions. As the honourable member said, it is also right that the splintering of a number of different union groups within the one industry allows one group-a minority group at that-to hold the rest of the employees within that industry, as well as the public as a whole, to ransom. It might well be said that in the recent airline dispute one small group of employees did precisely that. The House will recall that both Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines were obliged to stand down other employees for whom they had no work because of the action of the hostesses. I can assure the House that I have a lively interest in the policy of the establishment of industry unions and I will be actively pursuing it during my ministry.

Included among the aids were the widening of doorways, the provision of access ramps for wheel chairs, grip rails and home aids.

Those discussions are continuing; they have been taking place on a continuing basis.

In view of the fact that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is not involved in any of these settlements and agreements, does this mean that the roles of the Arbitration Commission and Government industrial relations policy are becoming increasingly irrelevant in the real world of union-employer bargaining?

If he is suggesting that the bargaining between unions and employers outside the arbitration system should be accelerated, I wonder whether he would consider that such bargains should be binding in a contractual sense and carry the remedies available to either side for the breach of those bargains. I would be very interested to know whether he would face up to that proposition. Many people in the community feel that the unions should be bound by the bargains they make and, if they break them, they should be liable to damages, or the like, in the same way as any other person in the community who breaks a contract which he has entered into.

Such an intention has been made to the Tribunal. As the honourable gentleman will recall, within that statement there were a number of phrases relating to transitional provisions. I have no doubt that the AAT, as indeed any court considering such a matter, would take note of the intent of those transitional provisions. However, no change in the law will apply or can affect any decision taken by either a tribunal or a court until it has been passed by the Parliament.

Is it a fact that certain young Australian sportsmen and sportswomen, including a number living overseas at the time, were offered guarantees of full time employment if they would accept places at the Australian Institute of Sport? Is it a fact that jobs have not yet been found for all those to whom they were promised? Further, is it not also a fact that some students at the Institute were subsequently told that they may not seek full time employment and may only chase after non-existent permanent part time jobs? Is it true that members of the Institute who took up their scholarships on the understanding that they would undertake studies at either the Australian National University or the Canberra College of Advanced Education have been told in mid-semester to drop out of units which clash with newly promulgated training schedules? Finally, can the Minister assure the House and all students at the CCAE and the ANU that pressure is not being applied to those two institutions to alter their lecture timetables to conform with the demands of the AIS administrators?

         —This is the first year of the Australian Institute of Sport. As applicants were interviewed and granted scholarships, indications were given, as I understand it, that efforts would be made to provide those who wished to seek employment with employment opportunities. I am not aware of any firm guarantees having been made. If the honourable member has any case in mind where such an impression was created, if he would provide me with the details I would be only too willing to seek information from the Chairman and the Executive Director of the Australian Institute of Sport. This year, as I mentioned, is the first year of operation of the Institute. It has involved the development of relationships between the Institute and the various educational bodies in Canberra. If there has been any difficulty in respect of training times and course lecture programs, again I would be appreciative if the honourable member could supply me with the details. Through the board and through the liaison committee that has now been established it is hoped to smooth out some of these early difficulties to ensure that those who have scholarships are able to carry out their training programs in their chosen sport and also complete the educational program they have undertaken.

        There is no intention on the part of the Government to reduce the availability of vitamin and mineral supplements; I wish to make that absolutely clear. However, we are concerned to ensure that consumers of products, including products covered by the vitamins and mineral supplements area, are in a sound position to be aware of the contents of the products that they are consuming. Therefore we are making sure, to the best of our ability, that the information supplied on the labels of a product is such that it will make it easily understood by those people who wish to avail themselves of the product. I think it is most important that there be continuing consultation between industry representatives, individuals, individual firms and the Government. I will continue to implement a policy which allows that consultation to take place. I repeat that there is no intention on the part of the Government further to restrict the availability of vitamins and mineral supplements.

That is a little later than was originally thought but, as honourable members will understand, the scope of this inquiry is quite without precedent so far as our financial and economic system is concerned.

We made it clear that we understood it would want to do that. At the same time, I made known to the Secretary of State, during my visit to America, Australia's concern that if the delay caused by that was such that the draft convention as a whole was at some risk both Australia's vital interests and the stragetic interests of the United States could be at risk. I was given to understand that in its initial review the United States regarded a lot of the draft convention as acceptable but there were elements which it wanted to look at again. Since then the Australian and the United States delegations have been in close contact and we are hopeful that in due course, when the new Administration has completed its review, the great progress that has been made over recent years in drawing up a draft convention of the law of the sea, will be translated into a document which governments can ratify. I understand that the United States is not likely to be in a position to give its final position by the next meeting, which I believe is set down for early August. In the meantime, we are consulting the United States Administration to ensure that the progress that has been made can be built on in the final convention.

         —Firstly, I think that we need to understand why Australia does support the principle that there should be cabin attendants in domestic aircraft. Annex 6 to the International Civil Aviation Organisation Convention, under the heading 'Operation of Aircraft', lays down the standards for cabin attendants. It requires the operator to establish, to the satisfaction of the state of registry, a minimum number based on seating capacity to effect safe and expeditious evacuation in an emergency. It also requires seating for and protection of cabin attendants and training in emergency functions. Section 20.16.3 of the Air Navigation Orders requires cabin attendants to be carried on passenger aircraft carrying more than 15 passengers-that is, on a scale of one cabin attendant to 36 passengers or part thereof up to 216 passengers. Our requirements are slightly more stringent than the requirements in the United States and the United Kingdom where the scale is basically one cabin attendant to 50 persons.

I have an open mind on the matter, but one thing I will not have an open mind on is to take any decision whatsoever or give any instruction whatsoever that in any way compromises safety in aircraft.

On Monday of this week the Federation considered a paper to put to me. I will be considering this paper in the next week or two. I am hopeful that negotiations can be concluded in time to set the objective, which I have stated earlier in the House, of a three-year program of underwriting instead of ad hoc arrangements that have applied in previous years. Only time will tell whether that will be achieved in time to set the program before 30 June this year.

Has the United States Veterans Administration expressed concern at the possibility of the Australian Government's inquiry establishing a causal link between the use of chemicals and subsequent breakdown in health because of the precedent it would set in establishing liability of the United States Administration for United States veterans similarly affected? Has the United States Administration urged the Australian Government to 'cool it' and to try every means to avoid liability?

The Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs have been doing everything they can to help resolve this issue. I am not aware of any expression of concern by the United States Government in relation to establishing a causal link in relation to problems or difficulties that any individual might have. But let me only say that if any such expression of concern did come to this Government from any other government, including the United States Government, we would not 'cool it', as the honourable gentleman suggests. We would press on with what we believed to be right and do everything we possibly could to assist the veterans concerned. I would believe, subject to advice which I will seek immediately after Question Time, that the United States Government would be just as interested in getting to a proper resolution of this important human problem as we are.

From what I know, very good progress is being made with the design of the structure of the dam and also the geological investigation and survey work. Up to the end of this year it is expected that the Queensland Government will have spent a little over $4m in doing this work. There has, however, been some temporary delay in the construction of one of the access roads, but I am told that this is only temporary and everything is proceeding according to plan. There is no reason why the Commonwealth Government's commitment should be altered in any way whatsoever.

We on this side of the House make no apology for the fact that we have a foreign investment policy which offers intelligent attractions for foreigners to invest in this country. At the same time our foreign investment policy has sought to achieve a balance between the need for a capital-scarce country such as Australia to attract large amounts of capital and also to ensure that Australians get a fair share of participation, particularly in new resource projects. The administration and implementation of foreign investment policy over the past 12 months has been characterised by a determination of this Government to ensure that the 50 per cent Australian equity guideline is fully observed.

In fact, the criticism that has been heaped upon this Government in respect of those projects has come more from those who believe that we have taken too doctrinaire an attitude in relation to Australian equity and Australian participation.

        The truth about foreign investment in this country over the past three years is that we have successfully achieved a balance between the need to attract foreign investment and the need to see that Australians get a fair share of participation. Of course, there has been an enormous upsurge in foreign investor interest in this country, and that derives from two factors. Firstly, people now realise that we have totally reversed the anti-investment policies adopted in the years 1972-75. Secondly, people overseas recognise that this is one of the most stable, predictable and best economic climates in which to invest.

The Federation now accepts that there is a difference and understands the difference between a White Paper and a Green Paper. As a result of those discussions, yesterday we announced to the Federation that, with the co-operation of the farmer organisations and some Government leaders, a Green Paper, or Policy Discussion Paper as it is now called, will be prepared. The terms of reference to be used in the preparation of that Green Paper have yet to be decided, as has the membership of the team that will prepare it. I might say that the National Farmers Federation does believe that the agreement to prepare a Green Paper, the policy discussion paper, represents one of the most important successes it has had since its formation.

       The motion calls for the establishment by this House of a select committee on taxation. In moving the motion for the establishment of such a committee the Opposition is expressing its very real concern at the deterioration of Australia's system of taxation over recent years. Since the advent of the Fraser Government 5 1/2 years ago Australia's tax system has been used in a totally unprincipled way to achieve short term political gains, to reward coalition supporters and to achieve a general redistribution of income away from the great bulk of the population in favour of a small, wealthy elite. The result of that process is a tax system which falls a long way short of achieving the desirable characteristics of a tax system and which commands less and less support from within the Australian community.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Labor Party feels that immediate action must be taken to reverse those trends. To that end, a select committee capable of taking a more independent, long term view of the tax system would perform an invaluable role. Such a committee would be able to investigate the effects and shortcomings of the current tax structure, could formulate a stable framework for longer term reform, could examine and advise the Government on the impact of profound changes to the system and would provide valuable public information for a wide-ranging taxation debate. In short, such a committee would play a similar role on the revenue side of the Budget to that which the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure plays on the expenditure side. Surely if it is reasonable to have an expenditure committee, the establishment of which the Opposition strongly supported, it makes just as much sense, if not more sense, given the controversy surrounding taxation within the community, to establish a committee to examine the revenue side of Government policy.

      <para>
       There are a number of objectives to which any tax system should attempt to conform as closely as possible and which would be the reference points of such a committee. These objectives are well-known and, indeed, the present Treasurer (Mr Howard) has made a point of referring to them on many occasions. First, and the Opposition regards this as of prime importance, a tax system should be fair or equitable. This requires that persons in the same situation, with similar income, should be equally treated. Parliament often provides specific concessions to persons in certain circumstances to enhance the equity of the tax system-for example, the spouse rebate, zone allowances and limited rebates for health and education expenses. Further, it seems to be generally accepted that taxation should be levied according to a person's ability to pay; that is, people with higher incomes who are in a better position to pay tax should do so. In other words, our tax system should be progressive.
      </para>
      <para>
       Secondly, the tax system should be simple to understand. It should not impose undue compliance costs on taxpayers nor should taxes be overly expensive for the authorities to administer and collect. Also, the tax system should be efficient, enabling the government to achieve its revenue objectives and collect taxes from designated persons and activities with a minimum degree of fuss. Finally, the tax system should, as far as possible, be neutral in its impact and should not influence people to choose one course of action rather than an alternative solely because of tax benefits. Naturally, any government will want to encourage desired activity, resource allocation and so on, but, in our view, such intentional departures from neutrality should be kept to a minimum and used only where a similar result could not be better achieved in some other way. Otherwise, all other objectives may be undermined as the tax system becomes more complex and cumbersome, and open to abuse.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I have already mentioned, the Treasurer has been at pains in the past to remind us constantly of these desirable objectives for the tax system. Yet, despite the rhetoric, there has developed a clear contradiction between what the Treasurer has identified as a good tax system and what he has actually produced since he has occupied the Treasurer's office. His policies and those of his predecessor have dangerously emasculated Australia's income tax system during their terms of office. Any thought of well-considered, balanced reform has been thrown out the window by successive coalition Treasurers who have been more intent on manipulating the system to serve the economic interests and ideologies of the Government and its supporters. Short term political self-interest has taken precedent over rational taxation decision-making.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us look briefly at the Government's record on taxation. The most striking aspect of this record is undoubedly the Government's blatant dishonesty with regard to taxation. First there were the tax cuts before the 1977 election-surely everyone remembers the fist full of dollars advertising and the 'Dial-a-Tax-Cut' campaign-which were to apply from 1 February 1978. It is now history that these tax cuts lasted only until the 1978 Budget when the so-called 'temporary' 1.5c tax surcharge was introduced. This surcharge had a highly inequitable impact despite repeated assurances from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The Treasurer and the then Minister for Finance that the surcharge would last only for eight months, these promises were quickly forgotten and the surcharge continued until November 1979 and was in fact reflected in yearly tax rates right up to June last year.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second gross deception of Australian taxpayers related to tax indexation. In 1975 the Prime Minister promised to index taxes fully for inflation so as to 'make government more honest with your money'. These were fine sentiments which again did not stand the test of the Government's expediency. In no year since that promise was made have we had full tax indexation. Indeed, tax indexation was suspended during 1979-80, there was less than half indexation this year and it will be abandoned completely from after next year. The Government has been roundly condemned for these broken promises and its credibility on taxation is in tatters. Yet the Prime Minister and the Treasurer seem to be unable to learn from their mistakes. During the last days of the recent election campaign, when the Government was searching desperately for a favourable issue, both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer promised that any further increases in oil levy revenue would be handed back as income tax cuts. Again this promise has been forgotten and the entire $400m collected in a full year from the January oil price increase has flowed straight into Government coffers. Such blatant manipulation of the tax system for short term political gain, as these actions indicate, can lead only to a distinct move away from the aims of equity, simplicity and efficiency and a marked deterioration in public support for our system.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another disturbing trend has been the increasing use of the tax system by this Government to provide concessions to various supporting interest groups. By using the tax system rather than making direct grants through the expenditure side of the Budget, the Government is able to hide from public scrutiny the extent of its subsidies to privileged groups in the community. On our estimates, since coming to power the Government has legislated for some 44 tax concessions-12 to farmers, 13 to companies and 19 others, mainly related to gifts and the film industry. The costs of these concessions are unknown and once introduced they tend to become part of the status quo and continue unquestioned. Often they are not directed to persons most in need of assistance and are difficult to control to prevent abuse. Honourable members have only to look at the fiasco of the concessions to the film industry to realise the scope for exploitation of such measures.
      </para>
      <para>
       Only two of this long list of concessions-adjustments to dependants' rebates-have related to the great bulk of pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, who are the taxpayers most in need of assistance. The other concessions have all gone to various lobbies and high income taxpayers, thus increasing the proportion of the tax burden borne by ordinary taxpayers and, in our view, greatly reducing the equity of the system. This would be a major area for inquiry by the select committee. Apart from those I have mentioned there are a vast number of tax concessions, awarded for a great variety of purposes, which have accumulated in the Income Tax Act over a long period and a number of governments. Most, have become well entrenched and are looked on as the norm, rather than as special concessions designed to achieve specific tasks, which is how they should be regarded. The continuing cost of them is unknown, except possibly to people within the Taxation Office. Worst of all, such concessions provide the breeding ground for tax avoidance-for smart operators to design highly artificial schemes in order to gain various tax benefits to which they would not otherwise be entitled.
      </para>
      <para>
       To my knowledge very little recent work has been done in this area. The select committee would perform a valuable task in making the tax system more equitable, simple and efficient if it were to examine, among other things, the whole gamut of tax concessions to determine their real relevancy and if it were to vet closely any new proposed concessions, to determine their cost, necessity and effectiveness.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another area of prime relevance to the committee's activities would be the area of tax avoidance. Tax avoidance has mushroomed over the last few years. As the last annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation shows the number of identified participants in tax avoidance schemes last year was 20 times higher than in 1975-76. The estimates of the annual loss to revenue are of the order of $1,000m, or perhaps much higher. These successful tax avoidance activities by high income earners are further destroying tax equity and placing a much heavier burden on the great majority of low and middle income earners, so much so that PAYE taxpayers are paying an extra $4 to $5 a week to make up the lost revenue.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has tried to stem this flood of lost revenue, but without success. The case-by-case approach adopted by the Treasurer leaves the Taxation Office too far behind the tax avoiders and unduly complicates the tax Act, opening up further scope for tax avoidance. In addition, the Government is clearly unwilling to act against several blatantly used schemes which have caused huge revenue losses for a number of years. These include: Contrived internal superannuation schemes, trusts, which are still a lucrative form of tax avoidance for very high income earners; foreign tax havens which involve the laundering of profits through low tax countries; and transfer pricing by multinational corporations. These last two are said by the Secretary of the Australia taxpayers Association to involve revenue losses in excess of $2,000m. Clearly a new approach to tax avoidance is necessary. Given the substantial problems which the Government is likely to encounter with the attitude of the High Court of Australia to the enforcement of a new general anti-avoidance section, alternative policies against the tax avoidance parasites are urgently needed.
      </para>
      <para>
       A fundamental task of the committee would be to develop such policies and to look at a means of overcoming schemes such as those I have mentioned. In addition, the committee would play a central role in investigating and advising the government on the methods and extent of tax avoidance within the community. By publicising the proliferation of certain schemes and ensuring that they were brought to the Government's attention the committee would provide a powerful deterrent to continued tax avoidance. One scheme which could initially occupy the committee's attention would be the assignment of book debts by certain professional groups. This scheme has been used widely since the middle of 1979. As figures in my possession show, it involves the avoidance of considerable amounts of tax by privileged high income earners. It is this sort of scheme which the parliamentary committee should seek out and identify in order to stop it as quickly as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is clear that certain professionals, such as doctors, barristers and dentists, are taxed on the basis of actual cash receipts compared with most businesses and other self-employed taxpayers who are taxed on the basis of what they earn, including money owed to them, but not actually received. Taking advantage of this fact, doctors and other groups involved take action to divert the money owed to them before it is received and tax becomes due. They do this by assigning such book debts, by way of gift, to their spouse, children or family trust. It is then argued that these debts are not income in the hands of the recipient but are capital and thus non-taxable; nor does the income have to be declared to the Taxation Commissioner. The doctors, dentists, or whoever uses this scheme, may register the assignment of book debts, at least under State law in Victoria, with the Registrar-General, and may have to pay stamp duty and possibly gift duty although this can be avoided if the gift is for the maintenance and education of children, but they are still able to avoid paying large amounts of income tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have in my possession three legal opinions by top tax lawyers which have been provided to support the scheme's legality. They have been prepared by Mr Clifford Pannam, Q.C., Mr I. C. F. Spry, Q.C. and Mr A. J. Myers. All support the view that once bills owed by the clients and patients are given away they become non-taxable in the hands of the professional's wife, trust, children or close friend. The proliferation of this scheme is most disturbing. According to my information it is being used in most States. However, it seems to be most prevalent in Victoria. Certainly it is easier to trace in Victoria because of the requirements of State laws that any such assignments be registered. It is, therefore, possible by examining the relevant public register to determine just who has been ripping off the tax system in this way.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have carried out a search of the register in Melbourne, at the Registrar-General's office, and found, much to our consternation, that in the last two years at least 150 doctors, dentists, solicitors, barristers and others have registered such assignments or notified their intention to do so. Among this list are five respected Queen's Counsel-Mr J. L. Sher, Mr A. J. Chernov, Mr E. W. Gillard, Mr D. G. Williamson and Dr Pannam, whose opinion I have already referred to. I seek leave to incorporate in Handsard a list of persons who have registered or notified an intention to register the assignment of book debts with the Registrar-General's office in Melbourne.

        —I thank the House. The total amount of book debts shown in this list-not all the assignments registered show an actual amount; indeed quite a few do not-is $2,800,000. This means that at 60c in the dollar $1,680,000 is lost in tax. The list makes interesting reading. I will cite some examples. On 6 December 1979 Mr J. L. Sher, a barrister of Brighton, assigned a portion of the book debts, being approximately 60 per cent of all debts up to and including 9 November, amounting to $30,950, to Diana Vicki Sher of Brighton by way of gift. On 15 April 1980 Mr Peter Charles Young, a barrister of Melbourne, assigned the whole of the book debts amounting to $73,930 due to him, in consideration of the natural love and affection, for the sum of $25 to Kay Lynette Young of South Yarra. On 6 June 1980 Dr Peter A. Gray, a surgeon of Brighton, made two assignments by way of gift amounting to $25,238.55 to Kay Lillian Gray of Brighton. The assignment consisted of almost 400 individual debts due to Dr Gray from private patients and hospitals ranging from a miserly $2.45 to almost $550.

       On 14 May 1980 Mr James Robson, a dental surgeon of Hawthorn made an assignment or transfer by way of gift to Santhor Pty Ltd of the same address-presumably a family company- of debts amounting to $14,781.62. On the same day, Annita Gibbon Robson, also a dental surgeon of the same address, made an assignment of $14,762.05 to the same company, Santhor Pty Ltd. On 12 August and 9 September 1980 Mr Paul David Blatt, a general practitioner of Rippon-Lea, made two assignments amounting to $4,454.10 to Peggy Blatt of Rippon-Lea. On 24 June 1980 Peggy Blatt, a barrister of Rippon-Lea, assigned debts of $3,499 to Paul David Blatt. However, this notice was subsequently changed so that debts of $3,174 were assigned to Peggy Goldberg, a barrister of Rippon-Lea, to Paul David Blatt. Obviously it seemed too blatant for husband and wife to be seen to be assigning debts to each other so Mrs Blatt decided to use her maiden name.

       These are just a few examples of the way in which the great bulk of taxpayers are being ripped off by the selfish actions of very high income earners exploiting this book debts scheme. My colleague, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), who will second the motion, will expand on the details of this scheme, how it can be easily stopped and why we think the Treasurer's response to it is totally inadequate. The proposed House of Representatives taxation committee could do the country a great service if it helped to put an end to abuses such as these. The committee would also be able to examine the very difficult issue of tax evasion about which we know very little at present. This is the area of black economy, cash payments and undeclared income. Little or no work is being done on ways to overcome this extremely difficult problem which is causing revenue losses of the same, if not greater, magnitude as the so-called legal tax avoidance. The Government announced in 1978 that it would take some steps towards restricting tax evasion in the building industry but it then backed off from that measure.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have detailed a number of major influences on the income tax system over recent years-the broken Fraser promises, the increased use of tax concessions, an explosion in tax avoidance and tax evasion. The net effect of all these measures has been a drastic increase in the tax burden on lower and middle income earners, so much so that 80 per cent of them are now paying a greater proportion of their weekly incomes in tax than they did in 1975. The only people who have benefited from the tax policies pursued over the last five and a half years have been the higher income earners who are now paying lower taxes than they did in 1975. In other words, because of the deliberate actions of this Government the income tax system has become regressive and much less equitable. These developments, along with those mentioned earlier, have meant that as a whole our tax system is no longer adequate to achieve its desired objectives. Indeed the equity of the tax system has been eroded to such a degree that according to a study published by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research in 1979 the tax system now is distinctly regressive. As incomes go up the proportion of income paid in all taxes goes down. This is so over the great range of incomes except for the very highest incomes. This we find highly disturbing indeed. Certainly it is an aspect of a tax system which could be looked at by the taxation committee.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are many other aspects of taxation which we would see such a committee as being able to investigate. This committee could take substantial note of the efficiency of the tax system to which I referred earlier and recommend measures to the Government to improve it.

        —It comes as no surprise to the House that the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) once again proposes a motion criticising the Government's handling of the tax situation. There is no doubt that there is scope for some degree of criticism of the volume of tax avoidance-of such a nature that it really becomes tax evasion-that has gone on in Australia. But for the honourable member for Gellibrand to say, as he has in effect, that this has occurred because this Government has failed in its proper duties in this area seems to me to be particularly curious. He is aware of the way in which the courts of this country, particularly the High Court of Australia, have approached artificial devices used by people in the evasion of their proper tax bills.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It is all very well passing laws to prevent people from evading tax. It is another thing to have a judicial system which supports those laws. The honourable member knows perfectly well that the High Court was very difficult in the matter of tax legislation when his party was in government. He knows perfectly well that the High Court has been particularly difficult in relation to legislation that this Government has endeavoured to sustain. He knows perfectly well that there is a section of the Income Tax Assessment Act totally outlawing artificial devices used by people in order to evade tax. He knows all that perfectly well. He recognises that the High Court has rendered that section of the Act inoperative. Yet he comes into this House pretending that this dreadful failing is entirely attributable to the Federal Government. I presume the honourable member for Gellibrand does not believe that we should stand over the High Court. I hope he does not believe that pressure should be brought to bear on the judicial system. If the burden of his objection is that we should have been able to find legislation acceptable to the High Court then the Government which he supported should have managed also to find appropriate legislation during its three years in office. It failed to do so. As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced during Question Time today, we will be presenting very shortly a proposed new section 260-the section to which I referred-which seeks to overcome the difficulties that have been established in our relations with the High Court. It will be a compendium piece of legislation coping with the general question of tax evasion of this nature. It is tax avoidance of a style that really becomes tax evasion.

       Difficulties have been experienced by legal decisions around the world. The honourable member for Gellibrand is well aware of the fact that the Privy Council-the law lords in Britain-recently came down with a revolutionary judgment changing the whole basis of its formerly legalistic approach to the question of tax law. This is a vital change which I hope will be reflected in Australia. In fact the law lords in the House of Lords took the view that they should see through the legalistic nature of the law and ascertain what the devices really sought to do. If only we had that kind of application of the law in Australia we would not have the sort of problems that the honourable member for Gellibrand has raised here today.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government has sought determinedly to pass laws to prevent the rape of the revenue which has been going on despite a mountain of laws which has made the taxation Act almost unmanageable. It is physically difficult to lift that Act. It is impossible to find one's way through it unless one happens to be an expert. Because of court interpretations, many legislative changes have been required to deal with every specific avoidance technique that has been raised by the experts in this area. There is a large area of professional expertise, as the honourable member for Gellibrand pointed out.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have been obliged to deal with each individual style of avoidance, but specifically as a result of the High Court's decisions we cannot deal with each avoidance measure until we find out what it is, or until it has been tried. The Australian Labor Party's solution to that problem is simply to make the law retrospective. That is a principle which the Labor Party embraces. It involves making something an offence which at the time it was committed was not an offence. It means that one ends up as a retrospective criminal. This is something which is absolutely intolerable and is not sustainable in our form of government and in our form of democracy. This matter received a great deal of attention in a study conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development into the problems of tax avoidance of a nature that really becomes evasion. The concept of making a retrospective offence something which was not an offence when it was committed is something which I believe flies in the face of our general proposition of the way in which we should be running our country.
      </para>
      <para>
       I hope that this very unfortunate situation-which the honourable member for Gellibrand quite rightly has pointed to-in which many people are avoiding their responsibilities to their colleagues, will be overcome by a combination of our proposed new section 260, which has taken many years of hard work to develop, and a change in the approach of the High Court. I am not assuming that the High Court necessarily will follow the Privy Council but I hope it does. I believe these two things could well bring about a dramatic change in the situation rightly pointed to by the honourable member for Gellibrand. My objection to the speech of the honourable member relates to the way in which he endeavoured to apply the blame. The honourable member should face up to the fact that under the Government he supported the same sort of problem existed and the same sort of blame could have been applied to that Government. Of course, the only difference is that this Government has introduced a mountain of legislation banning individual and specific devices which were ripping off the revenue. The major attempt by the Labor Government to deal with this matter was to wave Frank Crean's finger at one significant form of avoidance and do nothing else. Nothing was done about the Curran scheme, the major rip-off at that time. All that happened was that Frank Crean's finger was waved and there was a threat that legislation would be introduced. But introducing it was too difficult and too much of a problem for that government. Certainly, it took us a while to work out that sort of legislation necessary too. I concede that. All I am pointing out is that we did more than wave a finger; we introduced the legislation.

       The honourable member for Gellibrand knows perfectly well that the difficulties in this legislation are monumental. It is cynical of the honourable member to come into this House beating his breast in the way that he has, knowing the problems, recognising that his own government faced exactly the same problems and coped with them pretty badly. Some sections of this motion, of course, are of pretty poor quality. I am concerned that the honourable member has come into this House expressing his concern about the increased incidence of indirect taxation. His motion calls for the committee that he wants to appoint to enquire into:
      </para>
      <para>
       the impact on the equity of the tax system of the increased incidence of indirect taxation;
      </para>
      <para>
       Let me point out to the honourable member for Gellibrand that under the Hayden Budget of 1975 the volume of indirect taxation represented 28 per cent of total tax revenues. In the latest Budget, despite all the hoo-ha about the enormous oil revenues, that percentage has risen by a tiny amount. It has gone up from 28 per cent to 30 per cent. The honourable member talked about enormous distortion! What rubbish! The fact is that under the Government of which he was a member it was the lower income consumer in particular who carried the burden of indirect taxation. I dramatise this fact by pointing out that in the three years of the Labor Government sales tax, for example, which applies across a great range of commodities, went up by 14.4 per cent. Under the present Government sales tax in real terms-I am expressing the figures in real terms in both instances-has, in fact, declined by 6.1 per cent. We do not hear that sort of thing from the Opposition. It does not want to know about it. In fact, sales tax collections-something that could be described as attacking consumption-have, in fact, fallen by 6.1 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no doubt that we have had an increase in indirect tax under the present Government, basically as a result of the oil revenues. As a result, total taxation revenue under the present government has increased in real terms by 21 per cent over its five Budgets. People might say: 'Isn't it disgraceful that tax collections should go up by such an amount?' I point out to the House that in the three years of the Labor Government total tax collections rose by 24 per cent. In three years it managed to increase taxation revenue by 3 per cent more than we have in five years.

If the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) can understand the economic phrase 'real terms' he will know that that means that the figure is arrived at after accounting for inflation. If the honourable member for Prospect had looked at the statistics prepared by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library Statistical Service he would not have made such an asinine interjection. The reality is that there has been a 21 per cent increase in real terms in total tax revenue by the present Federal Government over five Budgets compared with an increase of 24 per cent by the Labor Government in only three years.

Under the previous government there was an enormous increase of 33 per cent in government spending which at that time was not matched by anything more than a 24 per cent increase in taxation revenue. We had to catch that up. We had to pay not only our own bills but also those of the Labor Government. That is what has happened. That is what these figures dramatically show. On the question of indirect taxation, I was intrigued, by the way, to hear the honourable member for Gellibrand misleadingly indicate to this House that we had an extra $400m 'in the kick' as a result of oil price rises. I am surprised that the honourable member for Gellibrand would use this device. He referred to a full year knowing full well that at the moment-he was trying to give an inference, of course, that we have a lot more lolly in the bank--

        —An implication. I bow to the honourable member for Lalor. The implication is that we somehow have ripped off more than we are pretending we have. There is a suggestion that something is naughty. The reality is that the net gain over the Budget Estimates-this is after taking this oil price rise into account and deducting, by the way, the cost of the industrial disruption that took place on the oil platforms; the Bass Strait strike-so far this financial year is something like $40m to $50m. At this stage this figure represents roughly one-tenth of the figure that the honourable member for Gellibrand was trying to indicate to the House. It seems to me that the honourable member for Gellibrand has failed to establish the basic grounds on which he has presented this motion. In the first place this Government has introduced masses of legislation seeking to remove the unfair nature of tax collections in respect of people being able to evade their proper responsibilities. This Government clearly faces the same problem in the High Court of Australia that the honourable member's government faced.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Let me dramatise the extent to which there is a problem in this area of tax collections. On the one hand, there is no doubt that the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer, for example, is carrying a larger burden than the non-PAYE taxpayer. A proportion of that burden can clearly be evidenced as coming from tax avoiders. On the other hand, the large proportion of that burden is a result of deliberate tax incentives which have brought about a degree of growth in some industries resulting in higher employment. Whilst there is no doubt that PAYE tax collections under this Government have gone up by something like 26.3 per cent and then tax collections-that is, non-PAYE tax collections-have fallen by 5.2 per cent, under Labor there was a 38.2 per cent increase in PAYE tax collections in real terms. We have dramatically cut that sort of rise. We have moved from a 38.2 per cent rise in only three years down to only a 26.3 per cent rise over five years. If the honourable member for Prospect wants to dispute those figures I remind him that they were prepared by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library. It seems to me that there is no doubt that the burden of taxation is being shifted as a result of avoidance schemes. There is also no doubt in my mind that the combination of this Govermment's effective measures and a change in the law will improve things.

        —The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) clearly spelled out the need for the establishment of a select committee on taxation. I propose to deal with that part of the motion relating to tax avoidance, and in particular the tax avoidance scheme already outlined by the honourable member. This scheme involves the blatant use, mainly by medical practitioners, barristers, dentists and other professional persons, of a tax avoidance scheme based on the assignment of book debts. Taxation for these people is on a cash receipts basis. They are not taxed on accrued debts which are assigned to a spouse or in some cases a family trust or a company. In the hands of the assignee the accrued debts become capital which is not taxed; that is, no tax is paid on such assigned debts. The scheme was the subject of two opinions, which I have read, by leading Melbourne Queen's Counsel. The first opinion was that of Dr I. F. C. Spry, Q.C., dated 11 June 1979. The second was that of Dr Clifford Pannam, Q.C., dated January 1980.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I point out to the House that there is some disagreement among tax lawyers in Victoria as to whether the assignments of debt referred to require registration. However, on the basis of the provisions of the Property Law Act and the Instruments Act in Victoria, the view seems to be that prima facie registration is necessary and is certainly preferable. As a result of the registration, persons using this scheme are to some extent able to be identified, at least in Victoria. Searches conducted at the Office of the Registrar-General and referred to by the honourable member for Gellibrand, indicate to some degree the people using this scheme. It is also on public record, because of the publication of the assignments, in the Dun and Bradstreet Gazette. However, because of the disagreement amongst the tax lawyers involved in this matter, many people would be using the scheme without registering the assignments. Research has shown that registration of assignments of debts to use this scheme took place as early as April 1979. By November 1979 the scheme had become a very popular method of avoiding tax. Yet an article on this matter, appearing in the Age of 21 January 1981, stated:

      </para>
      <para>
       It is really pathetic that the scheme had been a matter of public record in Victoria since, at the latest, April 1979 yet almost two years later the Treasurer in this Government was not aware of its existence. Unfortunately one has to accept that the Treasurer was not aware of it, but it is almost unbelievable that he was not. On 2 April 1981 I directed a question to the Treasurer on this matter. The Treasurer indicated at that stage that the Commissioner of Taxation 'will be contesting very vigorously what is being done'. That is a most commendable attitude but, to say the least, somewhat belated. It is now April 1981 and this scheme has been running untouched by this Government since about April 1979. The contest referred to by the Treasurer would almost certainly involve a High Court of Australia case, which on any analysis of past performances the Commissioner of Taxation could not enter into with any confidence. This matter was referred to by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) when he said that the difficulties that this Government had in this area were related to the interpretation by the High Court. We do not dispute that and we realise that there is a difficulty there but it is not a difficulty in relation to this tax avoidance scheme.

        —Well, let us hope so. This case indicates clearly the need for a select committee, which is the subject of this motion. It is not a scheme which necessarily involves an interpretation by the High Court. In answer to that question the Treasurer further indicated that if the efforts of the Commission were not successful, further action, including the consideration of requiring that an accruals form of taxation returning be adopted by people who presently enjoy the privilege of returning their incomes on a cash receipts basis, should be taken. If this Government has any credibility on the issue of tax avoidance-that is extremely doubtful, but in order to salvage some-it should give the Commissioner of Taxation legislative authority to act now in relation to this scheme. Why should the matter be considered further, as indicated by the Treasurer in his answer to the question? Already the people involved in this scheme have abused the privilege referred to by the Treasurer. What of the tax years 1979 and 1980? Does this Government propose that for those years the tax not paid will be written off? Surely a government utterly hung up on cutting expenditure in some areas for people in desperate need will not allow those earning huge incomes to continue their bludge on other taxpayers, which is what those involved in this scheme are doing. We are talking about massive tax avoidance achieved by a deliberate and highly artificial scheme.

       The honourable member for Gellibrand has dealt with some specific examples but in order to indicate the magnitude of this outrageous taxation fiddle I would like to give one example; that is, the partnership of six radiologists who assigned $60,000 of book debts to a company by way of gift. This assignment involved book debts for a period of two weeks, from 10 October 1979 to 24 October 1979. The amount of $60,000 was assigned thereby avoiding paying tax on that amount. But the Government is so inept that it has failed to take any action to stop such tax avoidance.
      </para>
      <para>
       Many of the people involved, as indicated earlier, are clearly identified by public records in Victoria. This position may not apply in other States as the same statutory provisions may not operate. However, if this is the case, assignments in equity can still be traced. It is not an excuse for this Government to say that if in other States there is no registration requirement it is then unable to trace the assignments of debts. This type of assignment in equity could be used in States other than Victoria and also by those tax avoiders in Victoria who do not register assignments. The tracing could be done in the following ways: Firstly, by checking falls in income levels of those taxed on a cash basis-that ought to be a reasonably simple procedure-secondly, by checking the incomes of those taxed on a cash basis which should have increased but, on the basis of returns submitted, do not show an increase; thirdly, by checking the returns for gift duty, as, in some cases, these tax avoiders are prepared to make a great sacrifice by paying gift duty! It is worth noting that in Victoria the current rates of gift duty are: Between $20,000 and $25,000, 1.5 per cent; $25,000 to $74,000, 5.6 per cent; and $74,000 to $201,000, 10.5 per cent. If someone on an income of $200,000 a year, assigning that amount under this scheme, paid any gift duty-which is unlikely-if he did make that great sacrifice, the rate he would pay would be 10.5 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       Fourthly, and most significantly, those people taxed on a cash basis should be required to advise the Commissioner of Taxation in their income tax returns of the details of any assignment of debts. Clearly, this would stop the scheme. The opinions to which I have referred indicated that at this stage a taxpayer need not advise the Commissioner of Taxation of assignment of debts.
      </para>
      <para>
       On the issue of tax avoidance, it is time this Government put up or shut up. We await with bated breath the redraft of section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is pathetic that it has taken five years for this Government to introduce such legislation. The burden of taxation on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers cannot be allowed to continue. This injustice was conceded by the honourable member for Macarthur but his figures were incorrect. It is time the correct figures were put on record in relation to the burden which has been placed on pay-as-you-earn income earners. Between 1975-76 and 1979-80 pay-as-you-earn incomes increased by 49 per cent while tax on those incomes increased by 73 per cent. In the same period, non-pay-as-you-earn incomes increased by 80 per cent while tax on those incomes increased by only 31 per cent. These figures highlight the dismal failure of this Government on taxation. They are tragic but not suprising as this Government has presided over tax avoidance becoming the major growth industry during its period in office. It has taken off. It is now a multi-billion dollar industry in this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Treasurer should remember the words of Henry Ford who said: 'You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do'. The Treasurer must act now to legislate on the scheme to which I have referred. Because of the nature of the scheme such legislation should be retrospective. The core of this problem is the failure of this Government to accept that position. Only when the intention of retrospectivity is clearly spelled out to the tax avoidance industry will we see the end of this disease, which has developed in the community under this Government. Further, if the Government is serious about abuses of our taxation system it should support the motion. The Parliament would then be in a position to take some positive action for the benefit of all Australians. If the proposed select committee had been in existence it would certainly have traced the scheme which I have outlined, which was on public record as early as April 1979 and which was still unknown to the Treasurer of this Government in January 1981.

       In closing I will deal with one matter raised by the honourable member for Macarthur. He attacked the Labour Government for its lack of action in this area. We hear this sort of continued argument from the other side of the House. It may well be rumoured in tax circles that Julius Ceasar was not effective in handling tax avoidance but the relevance of that to the debate today totally escapes me. Even if the Whitlam Labor Government had not handled this matter in a correct fashion it would not be an excuse for this Government. But it should be recorded today that such a claim is totally untrue. The previous Labor Government took wide ranging action against tax avoidance. I have a list of such action taken by the Labor Government between 1972 and 1975. I seek leave to incorporate that list in Hansard.

Whilst he complained about the lack of action by the present Government, his speech was very long on rhetoric but very short on facts. I support the record that this Government has in relation to the record of the Australian Labor Party in this area. During its three years in office, the Labor Government had before it notice of certain tax abuse schemes. It threatened to implement action against them but it did not do so at any stage. Those three years were vital. What is now described as the disease of tax avoidance and abuse was created, I believe, in those years when no action was taken.

        —It is easy to demonstrate that tax avoidance schemes take at least two to three years to show their heads. The fact that a scheme was discovered in 1975-76 indicates to me that its birth took place in Labor's period in office and not in the period of the present Government. Tax avoidance schemes were in evidence in Labor's years but the Labor Government and its Treasurer, Mr Crean, took no action. In fact, Mr Crean did not go ahead with certain actions he outlined, I think in the 1973 Budget.

        —It is 1981 but the same Labor team is now in opposition. Its members are as long on rhetoric now as they were then. Perhaps in 1981 they can come up with the answers that they could not find in 1972 to 1975. Let me set the record straight. The Labor Party has claimed that it did a lot in relation to tax avoidance in 1972 to 1975. It did absolutely nothing. A comparison of the records of the Labor Government between 1972 and 1975 and the Fraser Government from 1975 to the present does not do the Labor Party much credit. A number of things have been done. Nobody has said that what has been done is sufficient. A review by a select committee would not be sufficient. I point out to the Opposition that over many years the Labor Government as well as this Government could have taken action on many reviews and reports indicating where the problem lies.

       Courts in Australia have interpreted taxation statutes in a very literal manner. Thus, although there is a general anti-avoidance provision in the Income Tax Assessment Act, section 260, it has not generally been applied to schemes which have the intent of avoidance but also other demonstrable purposes. The tendency to exclude from consideration factors which are not strictly relevant to the letter of the law simplifies matters for those seeking to devise legal means of avoiding their taxation liabilities. It has in the past forced legislators to adopt a case by case and legalistic approach to countering tax avoidance. Governments have been forced into reacting to the initiatives of tax avoiders and the revenue and responsible taxpayers have certainly been disadvantaged. This Government has a firm commitment to remove the advantages tax avoiders have had in the past. Again I refer to the fact that the Labor Government had a similar commitment but it did not implement it. The Government will not countenance the actions of those with sufficient wealth and lack of responsibility in forcing a greater taxation burden on those in the pay-as-you-earn system, those with low incomes and those who accept their taxation responsibilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The burden of tax that is shifted by avoidance schemes is no small matter. It has been estimated by the Commissioner of Taxation that in 1978-79 $230m was lost to revenue. In 1979-80 the figure was $280m. At the end of 1980 an amount of $700m was in dispute. In the current year the estimated loss to revenue is $300m. These sums would have been significantly larger were it not for the Government's very active campaign against tax avoidance. There is justified resentment by the majority of income earners in having to pay a larger tax bill because of the minority who seek to avoid their share of support of community services. It is basic to the equity of the tax system that the burden of taxation be distributed fairly. I do not think anybody disagrees with that. This Government has attacked avoidance by adopting many approaches. It has developed a system of identifying and reacting promptly to particular avoidance schemes. It does not accept, as the Labor Party accepts, retrospectivity. However, it has reduced the former time advantage of tax avoiders by making schemes invalid from the date of announcement of intended legislation and by eliminating the possibility of carrying forward losses. It has undertaken drafting of new general anti-avoidance legislation to overcome deficiencies in section 260.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think when the legislation comes before Parliament we should ensure that it is certain in its application and that it does everything that it is intended to do. If it does not there will be a loss of two to three years before the legislation can be tested before the courts. If the legislation is deficient those two or three years will be lost. I would advise that caution and certainty be applied in this area so that when we get the legislation it does everything we want it to do.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Government is also revising provisions which apply to transfer pricing and other avoidance arrangements conducted through international transactions. The Government has acted in other ways to counter tax evasion. It is now a criminal offence to act, or to aid and abet someone else to act, to prevent the actual collection of income and sales tax by private companies and certain trusts. Reflecting on that, I would say that if such a measure were subject to the retrospectivity provision that the Labor Party espouses, one would be doing what the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) said-making something illegal today that was legal yesterday. Although it was a difficult problem to overcome, the Government did act to correct the anomoly but did not make the legislation retrospective.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has appointed and regularly consults with a taxation advisory committee of private sector practitioners of noted ability and experience in the taxation field. I have always felt that if we are to effect proper legislation and attack schemes properly then we should consult the people in the taxation field who have the necessary experience. I do not think we should take the advice of public servants only in this matter. Their advice should be blended with the expert advice of people who practise in the taxation field and who have experience in private enterprise. In a case-by-case approach to tax avoidance-the Treasurer is notified by the Commissioner of Taxation of evidence of new avoidance schemes-he has announced his intention to legislate specifically against these schemes, with legislation to date from the time of announcement. By this means, the Government has, since 1977, introduced nine Bills incorporating 24 legislative measures against avoidance arrangements. What was the Labor Party's record in this regard when in office? I do not think it introduced any Bills. Other amendments have been enacted to deal with sales tax avoidance arrangements. Further legislation will be introduced in the current sittings.
      </para>
      <para>
       The arrangements against which the Government has acted have fallen into two general categories: Firstly, schemes which seek to obtain artificial deductions; and, secondly, schemes which attempt to shield income from taxation. An illustration of the first is expenditure recoupment schemes. In September 1978 it was announced that amendments to the income tax Act would be introduced to counter certain identified recoupment schemes. These amendments related to pre-paid interest, pre-paid rent and similar schemes. Those schemes, and future ones of a like nature, were to be dealt with effective from that date.
      </para>
      <para>
       In early 1979 legislation was foreshadowed to deal with new schemes relating to variations of these, abuses of stock provisions, abuses of mortgage interest deductions and a variation of the Curran scheme. In June of that year, schemes involving deductions for bad debts were included in legislation effective from September 1978. In August of last year, legislation on further schemes involving so-called expenditure on films, in operating on exempt gold mining businesses, on consumable supplies and on market research were similarly back-dated. An illustration of the second category of action against which the Government has legislated is the exploitation of the privileged tax status of certain charitable institutions and other bodies that are exempt from tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now wish to deal with the revision of section 260. Section 260 had originally been conceived as a general anti-avoidance section. However, as the Asprey committee noted, the courts have held that for section 260 to apply, it must be shown that a scheme was implemented in a particular way to avoid tax; it would not be applied, for example, if the use of arrangements were capable of other explanations than tax avoidance. This contrasts with a recent case in Britain in which the House of Lords departed from such a legalistic approach to see through a series of deals to judge the motive behind them. I think this is a major breakthrough in relation to precedents. I wonder how long it will take for Australian courts to adopt a similar procedure.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Asprey committee noted in its report that transactions which are a genuine ordering of affairs and those which are of an artifical nature often follow much the same path. It highlighted the difficulty of enacting legislation to cope with the separation of such transactions in a language that fulfils the ideas of simplicity and precision. For example, the committee pointed out, firstly, that such a statute needs to apply to such a variety of circumstances that obtaining adequate coverage requires extensive wording; but, secondly, if it is to be sufficiently all-embracing there is a real danger of penalising those with a genuine reason for entering into a transaction which, in other circumstances, should be prevented. The Government's revision of section 260 attempts to make it applicable generally to schemes which are undertaken for the purpose of reducing liability to income tax. As is evident from what has been said, this is a difficult and complex task. It has thus not been possible to complete this task quickly, although the revision is now close to final drafting. The Government has, of course, sought appropriate consultations, including consultations with the Taxation Advisory Committee. The new legislation has already undergone considerable redrafting. It is intended that there be ample opportunity for those interested to make comments on the proposed changes. The Government is anxious that a reasonable time be allowed for examination of the legislation by those affected by it and by those who will be called upon to interpret it and advise on it.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is committed to removing inequity to the community because of tax avoidance through every means available to it. As I said, we have demonstrated this. The tax avoidance industry has grown to considerable proportions. I think approaches should be made, both by the Government and the Opposition, to ensure that we do clamp down on tax avoidance and ensure that the taxation system is equitable to all who pay into it. We have demonstrated a determination to crack down on tax avoidance by active legislative programs and the use of several directions of approach. The Government recognises that it can never completely eliminate tax avoidance or tax evasion. There will always be clever and unscrupulous people who will take the opportunity to manipulate the scheme. This Government is determined to work against those schemes whenever they are brought to its notice.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is a recognition within the community that the Government cannot solve the problems of tax avoidance in isolation. That is why it is looking to redraft section 260. Certainly, a constructive contribution has to be made by the business and the professional sectors if we are to implement legislation that will be effective. That is why I have such great hopes for the redrafted section 260. The Government has shown its willingness to hear the views of all interested parties. I hope that when the redrafted section 260 becomes available for comment, the private sector will make a constructive contribution to its success.

       The motion lists five areas which the proposed select committee should investigate. Some of those relate to the capability of taxpayers to pay their tax. While there is a tax avoidance and tax evasion industry billions of dollars of revenue is being denied. We should be concerned that that amount has to be spread over many areas. The pay-as-you-earn taxpayers are the people predominantly affected. We should also consider how far this distorts the proper tax impartiality as far as taxpayers--

In summary I should say the motion that has been moved on behalf of the Opposition is one that I think concerns the minds of Australians, particularly those who pay tax. No Government member would believe that the Treasurer through his advisers has not moved as rapidly as possible in the area of tax avoidance and certainly tax evasion. Therefore I have put the Government's case on the record. I would ask those who are interested in this subject to compare the Government's record with the record of the three years Labor was in office. As I said at the commencement of my speech, I think that that comparison will show that the Labor Opposition is very long on rhetoric but very short on action.

        —I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) to establish a select committee on taxation. In this Parliament this morning the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) gave an extraordinary expose on a tax avoidance scheme which has been going on since April 1979 and which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) as late as January of this year said he did not know anything about. The Treasurer has now decided to bring in legislation to close up that loophole. But, of course, the legislation will not be retrospective. I think that this is a very good reason to establish a select committee of this Parliament continually to vet all issues of taxation and in particular tax avoidance schemes. Perhaps the Treasurer, who seems to want to know about a scheme sometimes when he thinks he will get some cheap publicity out of it, will find that if such a committee is set up he will get information much more rapidly than he is getting it now. Some time ago I tried to expose the tax avoidance schemes being conducted by prominent members of this Parliament.

By selling the company and not the shares he was able to claim that this was a capital gain and not a profit even though he had bought most of the shares only a few days earlier. He contended that he was not bound by section 26AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. In other words, he contended that it was not a profit but a capital gain.

       The tax avoidance industry has been the greatest growth industry under the Fraser Government. There was very little tax avoidance until this Government came to power. Honourable members opposite ask what the Labor Government did about tax avoidance. The fact is that tax avoidance was not a major growth industry at that time. Since that time it has become a major growth industry and this Government refuses to tackle it. A system was introduced in the United Kingdom under which any tax avoidance scheme, when discovered, would be legislated against and the legislation would be made retrospective to the day the tax avoidance scheme was used. As a result the tax avoidance industry in that country was destroyed overnight.

An English company which no longer finds it profitable to operate in the tax avoidance industry in the United Kingdom has now established itself in Parramatta to engage in the tax avoidance industry in Australia. Until this Government wakes up to what is happening and adopts the Australian Labor Party policy of legislating retrospectively to the date of commencement once a tax avoidance scheme is discovered the tax avoidance industry will continue to flourish.

       That is one of the reasons we submit very clearly that this committee should be established. Its establishment is essential if we are to close these loopholes. It is essential if the Government is to be kept honest on this issue because at the present time it is not being kept honest. At the present time the Government is recognising tax avoidance schemes far too late-deliberately, in my submission-and is refusing to legislate against them restospectively to make sure that its friends are able to avail themselves of these schemes. For that reason I think it is absolutely essential that we establish this committee. It could be a watchdog in all areas of taxation and, in particular, in the area of tax avoidance. It would be a watchdog which would make sure that prominent members of this Government would no longer be able to indulge in tax avoidance schemes as they have done in the past, as exampled by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister of this country. For that reason I strongly support the establishment of this select committee.

        —Last evening in the debate on the motion to take note of the paper delivered by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) on health care services, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) made a statement after I had concluded my speech which seemed to indicate that I had made an attack on large private hospitals, generally seen as those which are run by charitable and religious organisations. I make it quite clear that at no time in my speech was I referring to private hospitals run by religious and charitable organisations. Indeed, I have a great sympathy for the plight in which they have been placed by the present Government's health arrangements. The private hospitals and nursing homes to which I was referring-I made it quite clear in my speech-were those conducted by private entrepreneurs, usually doctors, with profit as the motive for the conduct of them. They usually achieve this profit by referring their own patients to these hospitals. I take great exception to the inference by the honourable member for Murray that I was making an attack in particular on Catholic private hospitals in New South Wales because I believe hospitals such as Lewisham and St Margaret's have been those which have been most harmed by the present Government's health proposals. I think every assistance should be given to them.

        —by leave-This report covers two variations to the city plan. The first deals with a car park in Deakin while the other concerns the extension of William Hovell Drive from Coulter Drive to Kingsford-Smith Drive. The Committee has approved the Deakin variation which is for the gazettal of a car park to enable the construction of medical offices on the site. The Committee has, however, expressed concern about car parking in the area and asked for a report on the question of car parking to be submitted to the Committee in a year's time.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The proposed extension of William Hovell Drive has been given detailed consideration by the Committee. The Committee held a public hearing on the proposal on 13 March 1981 and a sub-committee of members inspected the proposed extension later that day. The Committee considered the evidence given at the public hearing at a later meeting and then decided to hold a further public hearing on the proposal. This hearing was held on Tuesday, 28 April. Prior to this hearing the Committee conducted a further inspection.
      </para>
      <para>
       Alternative alignments for the proposed road were considered by the Committee but the Committee was not convinced that any of them justified a departure from the preferred alignment proposed by the National Capital Development Commission. According to the National Capital Development Commission the road will cost $2.9m at 1980 prices. The first alternative proposal would involve moving the road 9 metres to the west of that preferred alignment. It would involve reconstruction of part of the intersection and would cost in the vicinity of $30,000. One member of the Committee, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) has submitted a dissenting report and has indicated his support for this proposal. The second proposal would increase the length of the road by 270 metres and would cost an estimated $120,000. The third alternative is to increase the length of the road by 600 metres. This would cost an estimated $350,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee acknowledges that the road may reduce the amenity of some residents near the road but also acknowledges the need for the construction of the road as an integral part of the road network for Belconnen and the additional cost to the community if alternative proposals were accepted.

       Accordingly, the Committee has approved the variation with the recommendation that the acoustic earth mound be raised by approximately half a metre. In conclusion, I compliment all those involved in the inquiry. The Committee cannot satisfy all those involved but it has made a decision in the general interest of the residents of Canberra.

        —by leave-As one of the members of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, I express our congratulations to the Hawker Residents Action Committee which participated in our hearings. Its members were most articulate and their evidence was very helpful to the Committee when making its decision. However, I make the point-this will be seen on a reading of the evidence and a reading of the report in full-that the estimates of costs of the possible alternative routes, as referred to by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry), are bare estimates only. They do not necessarily take into account any additional earthworks that may be required. In one case, they do not take into account the cost of lowering a water pipe and they do not take into account the costs of reconstructing the intersection into which this extension flows.

       When all these factors, plus the possibility of compensation to the landowner, are taken into account the figures of $120,000 for one route, or $350,000 for another are seen to be very bare figures indeed. The costs in fact would be somewhat higher than those figures. Taking that into account, the Committee could not justify recommending some more westerly alignment against the reasonable efforts proposed by the National Capital Development Commission to ensure that the proposed alignment is laid down with as little impact as possible on the environment of the neighbours.

         —by leave-The Review of Commonwealth Functions, chaired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch, has been the most significant and far-reaching ministerial undertaking of its kind ever undertaken by a Federal government. Its immediate aims are to streamline and fine down Commonwealth operations, partly by withdrawing from functions more appropriately handled by the States or private enterprise, and partly by rationalising the functions which properly belong to the Commonwealth. In the wider perspective, the aim of the Review is to establish the conditions under which there can be increased opportunities for all and better care for those in need.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Review's starting point is that Australia's greatest resource is the Australian people and that the role of government is to enable people to exercise their abilities, their skills, their imaginations and their enterprise. When this happens the result is economic growth, more jobs, higher incomes and a better life for all. If we ask why it is that the free and democratic nations of the West provide the best way of life for ordinary people, the unmistakable answer is that it is because people who live in these societies are free to build for themselves the kind of life that suits them best.
       </para>
       <para>
        Only individuals have full knowledge of their own needs, wants and priorities; politicians, officials and bureaucrats neither have this knowledge nor can ever have it. This is why government must not be intrusive and why strong and efficient government must not grow into big and bureaucratic government. Big government concentrates power, loses a perspective on its own limitations, and leaves less room for people to make their own choices. And we must not forget that it is people, their knowledge and their talents, their enterprise and determination, their belief that they can succeed, who have built Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fortunately, Australia's experience of big government has been comparatively slight. We had a taste of it between 1972 and 1975. In those years the Commonwealth Government's claims on the nation's earnings rose from 23.8 per cent of gross domestic product in 1972-73 to 30.1 per cent in 1975-76. Between June 1972 and June 1975 the number of Commonwealth Government employees rose by 52,000 and the number of State employees rose by 114,000. It is not surprising that towards the end of this period, private sector employment fell. It fell because the growth of government produced a massive loss of confidence and private enterprise was crowded out. Government was taking up too much room. Since the 1975 election, the Government has been making an historic turnaround.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has taken the view that we would all be better off in a material as well as in a social and political sense by establishing a more limited, and more realistic, role for government. Smaller government means eliminating waste, duplication and unnecessary costs of government. It does not mean austerity. The benefits of our program are now visible for everyone to see.
       </para>
       <para>
        More limited government is now encouraging massive job creation. In the last two years 300,000 new jobs have been added to the Australian economy-far more than government itself could have provided. But we must continue to make sure that there is sufficient room for the kind of individual initiatives which have built Australia and which are vital for Australia's future. This is why the Government has emphasised and re-emphasised the importance of the economy and the need for the most stringent controls on government expenditure. The Government has had to concentrate on economic management, not because it alone matters, but because a sound economy is a precondition of other objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        A sound and growing economy is important to Australians and their families. It is important in promoting the arts, in improving social security, health services, education and in protecting the environment. The growth of government and increasing centralisation in Canberra had been going on for a long time. The temptation for governments to increase their own power and expenditure is great and Labor gave a momentum to the growth of government which has beef reined in substantially over the last five years. The figures make the position plain.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the three years before 1972-75 there was a real growth of 4.5 per cent in Commonwealth outlays. In the next three years there was an enormous 10 per cent real growth per annum. In the five years since then, this Government has brought the growth down to only about 1 per cent per annum. We have worked for a turnaround. And I believe that the Review of Commonwealth Functions will contribute to a momentum that is building up in support of that turnaround. Each step towards reducing the cost of government to the community, slight though each may appear in isolation, contributes to this end. And alongside expenditure restraint, we have worked to reduce the burdens of bureaucracy on people, and we have returned a considerable degree of independent responsibility to the States. It is in the context of these concerns and aspirations that the particular actions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions should be viewed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the specific decisions arising from the Review of Commonwealth Functions.

       <para>

       <para>
        In detailing the decisions I will first of all deal with those which express the Government's objectives of strengthening private economic activity and the influence of individuals over the economy through their choices in the market place. In the view of the Government, activities of a commercial kind are generally best performed in the private sector, where they are open to greater influence from consumers and to the disciplines of competition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has therefore decided that a number of significant activities presently carried out by the Commonwealth Government can more efficiently be undertaken by private enterprise. We propose to offer for sale as a going concern the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo, the Australian Wool Testing Laboratory and some Commonwealth equity in the Wool Stores.

         —We will offer the Australian Government Clothing Factory for lease or sale as a going concern to the private sector. The Australian Government Publishing Service bookshops will be offered for lease to the private sector, as will the management of migrant hostels. Similarly, there are a number of areas where services are provided to the private sector by government but which would be more effectively provided by the private sector itself. Depending upon the result of other reviews affecting air traffic we will be prepared to consider offering the domestic airline terminals throughout Australia for sale. The Government has decided to proceed with the sale of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation.

        Shipbuilding assistance will be scaled down, the Shipbuilding Board abolished, and the ship design function will be transferred to the private sector. Surplus Commonwealth land and storeholdings are to be identified and sold. Again, the Government does not consider that traditional government monopolies should be able to use their privileged position to compete with private enterprise where no public benefit can be discerned. Accordingly, the Australia Post Courier Service will be abolished and increased use will be made of private contractors for mail cartage. The Australian Postal Commission will, however, maintain a service to be known as Australia Post Express, for the carriage of postal items only, as part of the mail service. The Commission's statutory monopoly powers will be closely examined to see whether they should be reduced or eliminated.

        In the area of telecommunications, a technological explosion is now occurring and exciting opportunities for private activity to introduce diversity and innovation are expanding rapidly. The area is a complex one, and the many significant issues arising here required detailed investigation beyond the resources of time available in the present review. The Government takes the view that the traditional monopoly in this area can no longer be considered sacrosanct. Accordingly, a major review will be undertaken of the activities of Telecom Australia to determine the extent to which the services it offers might be more effectively provided by the private sector. Pending the outcome of this inquiry the determination of standards for interconnection equipment will be transferred from Telecom to an independent body.

        We will complement the transfer of activities to private enterprise by contracting out to the private sector for the supply of certain goods and services to the Government. The in-house design of major works by the Department of Housing and Construction will be reduced from 60 per cent to 50 per cent of its activities and its in-house performance of minor works, repairs and maintenance activities will be reduced by around 50 per cent. The increased use of contracting out will also be reflected in the provision by the private sector of computer software services and technical advice. The Commonwealth also proposes to make increasing use of private surveyors, lawyers and accountants to perform essential functions on a contract basis. The scope for subcontracting an increased proportion of the Royal Australian Mint's total requirements for coinage blanks to the private sector will be reviewed and private sector tenders will be invited for the sole rights to market and distribute all Australian numismatic coins.
       </para>
       <para>
        Contracting out will also affect the Government Printing Office, whose activities will now be confined to essential parliamentary and government work, with the bulk of other work contracted to the private sector. Again, the work of cleaning and watching Commonwealth properties by the Department of Administrative Services and the provision of non-departmental food services will be contracted to the private sector.

        There is also scope for further contributions from outside Government to the nation's defence effort.

        One of the many virtues of the free enterprise system based on the market is that it decentralises influence and control over what is produced to the greatest extent possible. It gives consumers a greater say through their spending decisions than any other system. Through their decisions they have a dominant influence over the allocation of resources. The more government intervenes to change the impact of consumers' decisions through regulation and subsidies, the more control over the economy passes from the many to the few.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the course of the review of Commonwealth functions we have given close attention to many of the Government's regulatory activities, and to programs of industry assistance. Some degree of regulation is necessary to ensure the proper functioning of our free enterprise system. Government has a role in setting basic ground rules to facilitate the smooth functioning of private business activities and to ensure that appropriate information is equally available to all participants.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the years there has evolved a great deal of legislation which involves regulation of industry. Although some of this legislation benefits the community as a whole, and some of it has been put in place at the request of the private sector, it nonetheless imposes substantial costs on the taxpayer and the consumer and particularly on individual business enterprise. It is evident that much of government regulation of private sector activity is neither necessary nor effective and is certainly more costly than is self-regulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a significant step in the necessary process of deregulation we will abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal. This body has outlived its usefulness as a regulatory mechanism and is placing an undue burden on industry; there is no evidence that it is having any significant impact on the restraint of inflation. An appropriate mechanism will be established for the maintenance of the Government's petroleum product pricing policy. There will be a rationalisation of the industry assistance advisory functions within and between departments, including a reduction in the level of activity of the Industries Assistance Commission following from the completion of current tariff review references.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will continue its efforts to free the airlines from undue regulation and restriction. The oversight of Qantas Airways Ltd operations by the Department of Transport is to be reduced and a new financial directive issued to the airline which will free Qantas to conduct its operations in a more commercially competitive manner, including the ability to set its own minimum fares. In relation to the domestic airlines, Government policy has already recognised the advantages of greater competition. The Government has announced its in-principle decision to establish Trans-Australia Airlines as a public company. The Government has yet to make a decision concerning the ownership of that company. This action and the introduction of different and wide-bodied aircraft by each airline should result in a new era of competition between the two airlines. In addition the Government has decided to establish machinery independent of the regulatory authority, the Department of Transport, to hear and make decisions upon proposals for changes to air fares. We have also announced the establishment of an inquiry into whether further major deregulation of Australia's domestic airline industry is a desirable long term objective.
       </para>
       <para>
        The activities of the Australian National Line and Australian National Railways are also to be significantly deregulated. The Industries Assistance Commission is to investigate modifications and improvements to the Customs by-law system. Rent control in the Australian Capital Territory will be abolished and shopping hours deregulated. There are cases where both the Commonwealth and the States seek to regulate the same activities. Duplicated regulation is inherently inefficient. Therefore there will be a reduction in the range of activities of the Trade Practices Commission and the associated Trade Practices Division of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs which overlap with the States. The Commission will reduce its activities by more selective complaints investigation, reduce its level of adjudication work, reduce staff in education and safety and information standards monitoring and limit compliance work in relation to misleading and deceptive conduct and other unfair business practices to those matters that raise issues of importance at the national level. The Department of Business and Consumer Affairs will continue to maintain a national role in product and labelling standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from the burden of regulation, the Government is also continually reminded by industry of the burden imposed by the paperwork requirements of government. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is to eliminate a number of low priority statistical collections and review the frequency of other collections. Some 27 collections will be scrapped forthwith and another 29 subjected to further investigation and consultation with the States as to their usefulness. Charges will be introduced for industry-initiated statistical collections. We will make a concerted effort to scale down the paper burden on the private sector. All Ministers, and the departments and authorities responsible to them, are examining, with a view to reducing, the current level of data and information they collect.
       </para>
       <para>
        These measures by no means represent the end of our commitment to examining the possibilities for deregulation. In particular we are looking forward to the forthcoming report of the Campbell Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. We expect that it will give guidance on the possibilities for achieving substantial deregulation of another major area of business activity which the Commonwealth directly influences. Finally in this connection, it should also be emphasised that it is not only necessary for the Commonwealth to review its regulatory activity. As has been pointed out by the Confederation of Australian Industry, the States have, if anything, even more considerable responsibilities in these areas. I hope that the measures I have announced will act as a stimulus to the States to review their own extensive regulatory provisions.

        Industry Assistance

       <para>
        It is not only unnecessary regulation and information demand which imposes costs on the community. Assistance schemes for industry also impose costs on taxpayers, and it is necessary that these too be subject to review to determine the balance between costs and benefits. As private economic activity strengthens and becomes increasingly competitive, government assistance becomes less necessary and industry can be asked to pay more of the costs of the government services it requires. Taxpayers should only be asked to meet the costs of subsidies and other assistance where the benefits clearly warrant the expense. In the improved climate for business operations we believe there is less need for specific government initiatives to promote particular business activities which are essentially the responsibility of business itself and when profits should provide an adequate incentive.
       </para>
       <para>
        Wherever possible we intend to apply the 'user-pays' principle and introduce new or increased charges for Government services as the best possible determinant of the value of those services. Consistent with this we will be examining further the feasibility of requiring industry to meet the cost of membership of international commodity organisations. Charges will also be introduced for actuarial and valuation services, archives services, the services provided to industry by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, and for translation services and the assessment of overseas qualifications. The program of export inspection charging, aimed at recovering approximately 50 per cent of total costs, is to be extended: In the case of fish and dried fruit from 1 July 1981; of livestock, dairy products, eggs and honey from 1 July 1982; and of fresh, canned and processed fruit and vegetables from 1 January 1983. A significant rationalisation of meat inspection services has already been commenced and will be finalised by the Australian Agricultural Council in August 1981.

         —Yes. Reflecting the success of Australia's exporters in recent years the cost of the Export Expansion Grants Scheme has been considerably more than the Government anticipated. On its introduction in 1978 the Scheme was estimated to cost $66m annually; in the 1980-81 Budget $200m was provided. The Government has now decided that on its expiry in June 1982 the Export Expansion Grants Scheme will be extended by one year to June 1983 pending review by the Industries Assistance Commission; but that grant rates will be reduced by 50 per cent from 1 July 1982. The Export Now campaign is to be terminated. In the improved climate for business operations we believe there is less need for specific government initiatives to promote particular business activities which are essentially the responsibility of business itself and when profits should provide an adequate incentive. Accordingly the productivity improvement and industrial working environment functions of the Department of Science and Technology are to be significantly scaled down. The business information centres, established on a trial basis, will be terminated.

       <para>
        Taxation concessions for industry, which are equivalent in all practical senses to direct expenditures from the Budget, have also been reviewed and we have decided to reduce a number of currently available concessions. Some of the reductions are of the order of 10 per cent; the details of how the reductions are to be effected in each particular case are set out in an attachment to this statement. The reductions will affect the investment allowance, the 20 per cent loading on depreciation rates, the outright deductions for conversion of oil or liquefied petroleum gas fired plant, the accelerated write-off of general mining and petroleum mining development expenditure and the petroleum shareholder rebate. The Government acknowledges that there is inevitably an element of arbitrariness about these proposals but believes that some reductions in the level of taxation concessions available to industry are essential if the burden of containing the public sector is to be shared by all groups in the community.

       <para>
        I now turn to deal with the functions and responsibilities which will be returned to the States. Australia has prospered as a federal system. The federal system has strengthened and unified the nation by giving the major regions embodied in the States sufficient autonomy to adjust the services provided by government to local needs and desires, while at the same time guaranteeing each of them a strong voice in national affairs. A nation Australia's size cannot be effectively governed from Canberra, and attempts to inflate Canberra's power have been rejected again and again by the Australian electorate. The State and local governments are closer to the recipients of many services and are better placed to administer those programs. Their structure and location permits maximum response and involvement by those most affected by the decisions of government; they provide an effective barrier against centralist control.

         —And the honourable gentleman has none. Since coming to office we have acted to strengthen the bond of federalism between the Commonwealth and State governments. This has been reflected particularly in the changing balance of responsibility for the administration of programs and a marked decline since 1975-76 in the proportion of Commonwealth assistance provided to the State-local government sector in the form of specific purpose grants. Over this period, the proportion of total Commonwealth assistance provided as untied general revenue payments has risen from less than 40 per cent to around 50 per cent. This has provided a considerable increase in the funds available to the States which they can spend at their own discretion and without interference. The decisions I will announce continue this trend to allow the States greater freedom in deciding how they will spend their available finances. Our aim will be to maintain and assert national concern and to stimulate appropriate initiatives, while eliminating unnecessary overlap, waste and interference in the delivery of services and programs.

        As the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) advised the House yesterday the Government has concluded an extensive review of the arrangements for medical and hospital care in Australia. The changes flowing from that review were based upon the following objectives: Ensuring that eligible pensioners and the disadvantaged members of our community have free access to high standard health care; encouraging the general community to accept greater personal responsibility for their health costs through the application of the 'user-pays' principle; and removing inefficiencies and waste within the public hospital system.
       </para>
       <para>
        The measures announced yesterday by the Minister for Health meet these objectives and represent a comprehensive and responsible policy to maintain existing high health care standards while ensuring that providers and consumers of health services are made more conscious of the costs of those services. The changes restore to the States their traditional responsibility for managing public hospitals and encourage them to increase efficiency within these hospitals. They strengthen arrangements to protect eligible pensioners and disadvantaged persons against the cost of hospital and medical care; ensure that the general population becomes more aware of the costs of health services by increasing their responsibility for their health care costs while encouraging them to provide for these costs through health insurance based on community rating; and they enhance the invaluable role played by the private health delivery sector and especially that of private hospitals.
       </para>
       <para>
        These changes represent the outcome of a most comprehensive review of the health care sector in Australia; a review that would not have been possible without the untiring work of the Minister for Health and I am especially appreciative of his efforts. Finally, the number of and expenditure on advisory committees within the Health portfolio are to be significantly reduced. We will negotiate with the States with a view to transferring the pathology laboratories to them.

        As with health, the Commonwealth believes that the States have a primary responsibility for the administration and delivery of educational services. Accordingly, it proposes to reduce significantly its involvement in this area. There will be a reduction in the Schools Commission's direct involvement in program administration and information collection. Accordingly, the activities of the State offices of the Commission will be scaled down and the Building Unit in the central office disbanded. Consistent with a reduced role for the Commonwealth in activities which are the proper preserve of the States, the Curriculum Development Centre will be abolished unless the States are prepared to meet 50 per cent of its operating costs. Special support for educational research and the Education Research and Development Committee will be terminated. This will allow the States to determine their own priorities in these areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Australian Capital Territory the Commonwealth Teaching Service Commissioner's role will be terminated and the functions currently performed by the Commissioner taken over by the Public Service Board, the Department of Education and the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority. The Minister for Education will develop proposals for the re-structuring of the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority to improve its operating efficiency and management. The Government has before it the reports of the Schools Commission and the Tertiary Education Commission for the 1982-84 triennium and will shortly be issuing formal guidelines to the two Commissions. In determining these guidelines the Government will be applying maximum expenditure restraint to the programs in all sectors.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the tertiary level the Government has been concerned at the proliferation of separate institutions and proposes immediate action to reverse this trend and to provide for more efficient use of resources. Arising from the recommendations of the Tertiary Education Commission, the Government will promote a major rationalisation and re-allocation of resources in higher education. This will involve consolidation into larger units of 30 existing colleges of advanced education, for which teacher education is the main activity, by their incorporation into multi-purpose or multi-campus colleges with a single governing body or by integration with neighbouring universities. Additional resources will be provided for institutions which are able to expand their effort in the technology and business studies. An amount of $5m will be earmarked within the general recurrent grants for universities and colleges of advanced education in the years 1982 and 1983 to facilitate this process. Some action has already been taken in the States and it is the Commonwealth's intention to reach agreement with each State concerning the rationalisation measures by the end of 1981. If this cannot be done, the Commonwealth will not be prepared to continue recurrent funding for the colleges concerned after the end of 1981, and if the State governments wish these colleges to continue as separate entities they will have to make their own separate financial provision.
       </para>
       <para>
        In noting the view expressed by the Tertiary Education Commission in its triennial report that engineering courses in Victoria should be rationalised, the Commonwealth has decided to accelerate this process and intends that the engineering schools at Bendigo and Preston colleges of advanced education and at Deakin University be phased out with no new students admitted after 1981. The assesment of grants for the University of Western Australia and Murdoch University is to be based on a greater sharing of resources and collaboration between these two institutions. The Government does not see a need to establish a university in the Northern Territory as proposed by the Northern Territory Government and will not be providing funds for this purpose in the forthcoming triennium.
       </para>
       <para>
        For second and higher qualifications in universities and colleges of advanced education, fees will be introduced except for recognised double degree and diploma combinations. These fees will apply to new enrolments from 1982 but students who are in receipt of Commonwealth Government post-graduate awards will be exempt from these fees. The Government does not intend to introduce fees for tertiary students undertaking their first qualification. Eligibility for student assistance under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme is to be tightened. From the beginning of 1982, however, a loans scheme will be introduced for tertiary students. This will enable them to supplement their current income by amounts which will be repayable after graduation. This is a form of assistance which recognises the substantial benefits flowing to individuals from a higher education and thus expresses a sound balance of community and individuals interest. It reduces the burdens on taxpayers in an entirely appropriate way. The availability of this additional form of financial assistance will be taken into account in determining the level of benefits under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme.

        Other major programs which have been identified for early transfer to the States include urban public transport and the soil conservation programs. These transfers will involve the States' taking responsibility for full policy and administrative matters. We intend that field activity under the Adult Migrant Education Program will be undertaken wherever possible by the States and non-government bodies with the Commonwealth's role restricted to arranging and co-ordinating only. We will be proposing to the South Australian Government that the staff of the Australian National Railways working for the South Australian Transport Authority should be transferred to that Authority.

         —The New South Wales Government will be given the option of taking over the Glebe Estate Project and all States will be asked to share the operating costs of the Australian Institute of Criminology, given that State law enforcement and related authorities benefit from the Institute's activities. A new building in Canberra for the Institute will not be proceeded with. Responsibilities for the regulation and control of nuclear activities are to be implemented as far as possible by the States and the Northern Territory, with the Commonwealth maintaining a co-ordinating role.

        The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is to maintain its present policy functions, and will maintain control of marine parks and the essential Commonwealth interests in the Kakadu National Park, but we propose to scale down its general activities and to delegate responsibility for the operation of non-marine parks to the Northern Territory and Territory administrations. Responsibility for the financing of environmental regulatory services in the Northern Territory will be transferred to the Northern Territory Government. The funding of the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Protection Authority will also be transferred to the Territory Government. Grants to the States for Aboriginal housing will be integrated into the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of other Commonwealth activities which impact on State functions are also to be terminated as we no longer consider that they fulfil a useful purpose commensurate with their costs and the States are fully capable of meeting any remaining responsibilities themselves. The Regional Development Program, the Decentralisation Advisory Board, the Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension and Commonwealth involvement in rural extension services all duplicate areas of State activity and will be abolished. Expenditure under the Ord River Irrigation Act will be terminated after existing commitments have been met.

        We have carefully reviewed other joint Commonwealth-State programs and for the time being at least we consider that the Commonwealth should remain appropriately involved, but we are determined to simplify their administration and to eliminate any overlap and intrusion on what are properly the administrative concerns of the States. To this end we have decided that the following principles are to be employed in future by Commonwealth Ministers and departments in the administration of joint Commonwealth-State programs:

        Rationalisation of Commonwealth Government Activity
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the decisions relating to the Commonwealth Government's own internal activities. In making these decisions we have had several objectives in view. These were: Firstly, to make sure that Commonwealth Government activity does not crowd out private enterprise, inhibiting the private sector expansion on which job opportunities depend; secondly, to reduce unnecessary demands on the taxpayer by cutting back on bureaucracy; thirdly, to make sure that Commonwealth Government activities are performed with the greatest efficiency and effectiveness possible. The Government's attitude to expenditure restraint will be firmly in evidence in its approach at the forthcoming Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting. We will be able to demonstrate to the States that we have taken another major step towards putting our own house in order; we will be expecting them to follow our example.
       </para>
       <para>
        Expenditure on capital works is an important item in the Commonwealth Budget. With the boom in private investment associated with resource development there is a need to avoid overstretching the capacity of the building and construction industry. We have accordingly decided on major reductions in this area. The Government will withdraw its offer of asistance for the proposed Sydney-Melbourne railway electrification in view of the lack of priority accorded to this project by the States. Capital works for the proposed Canberra convention centre and Museum of Australia will be deferred indefinitely and the proposed Commonwealth Government Offices in Adelaide will be postponed for several years. No funds will be made available in the coming financial year for a number of building projects including the Canberra Law Courts, the National Library extension, the Townsville Commonwealth Offices, the Australian Federal Police headquarters, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation headquarters, the National Biological Standards Laboratory and the Australian Dental Standards Laboratory.
       </para>
       <para>
        In future all proposals for capital works will be examined solely in the Budget context. This will enable the Government to estimate more accurately the impact of these proposals not only on Budget outlays but also on building and construction resources within the economy. The future capital expenditure on airport works is being reviewed and a more co-ordinated approach to priorities will be established. Particular attention is being given to the scope for private sector and airline involvement in the construction of facilities, including the scope for developing facilities of a more modest standard.

        Other Commonwealth Activities
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to these decisions, the Government believes that the most rigorous control must continue to be exercised over spending by departments and authorities. For the coming financial year the Government intends that there will be a 3 per cent reduction in real terms on the current level of expenditure by departments and authorities on administrative and operational items, including property acquisition, repairs and maintenance and furniture and fittings.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be a further tightening of Budget review procedures with the onus of proof being on the proponent to justify any increase in expenditure over the same money provided in the previous year. Coupled with this we intend that there should be a further improvement in the efficient management of government departments. Every effort will be made to eliminate non-essential services, to combine common service areas, to make more efficient use of automatic data processing and to decentralise and delegate management decisions to individual departments. The Government has decided to terminate the computerised staff management system, called Mandata. The termination of the Mandata Program Office will be achieved without any increase in staff ceilings in departments and will result in a significant reduction of staff within the Public Service Board.
       </para>
       <para>
        The level of research activity and expenditure undertaken within government departments and authorities will be curtailed. The number of advisory committees and councils will be significantly reduced by abolition or amalgamation-this will apply particularly to the Science and Technology, Health, Education, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Capital Territory and Social Security portfolios. Altogether we will be winding up or amalgamating some 40 advisory committees. In future the Government will not as a general rule provide an annual payment or sitting fee to part time members of advisory bodies, although individual cases of hardship or real need will be considered on their merits. Appropriate guidelines will be determined.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government proposes to terminate the Assisted Passage Scheme forthwith. Negotiations will be necessary with some migration-agreement countries to phase out the scheme. Assisted passages will be available only to eligible refugees and to those formerly eligible whose applications have been lodged by today. We also intend to abolish the Legislative Drafting Institute and the Council for Aboriginal Development and not to proceed with the establishment of a Broadcasting Information Office. The Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission is to be replaced by an advisory body which, while retaining its independence, will be serviced by staff of the Attorney-General's Department rather than by a staff of its own.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Industrial Relations Bureau will be maintained. Following our review the Government believes that it is functioning with increasing effectiveness. In the interests of improved administation and better service for clients, we will examine the scope for greater co-location of the offices of the Departments of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service. In future, claim forms for unemployment benefit and fortnightly income statements will be lodged directly with the Department of Social Security; the requirement that unemployment benefit claimants visit CES offices fortnightly is to be removed. Again, in future all registered unemployed persons will be interviewed by CES officers after four months and those under 25 years of age still unemployed after eight months will be re-interviewed. The reasons for selecting these periods are so they will coincide with the eligibility criteria for our manpower and training programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The emphasis will therefore clearly be to help people: By placing them in employment; with our training programs; and by career counselling for those most severely affected by long term unemployment. The regular collection and publication of CES statistics of persons registered for unemployment and of unfilled vacancies will be terminated; more reliable information on unemployment levels will continue to be available through the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
       </para>
       <para>
        Significant room for staffing reductions exists in our diplomatic missions overseas. The staffing of the London and Washington posts will be cut by 232 and by 75 staff respectively. New guidelines will be issued on overseas representation. The overseas representation of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will also be reviewed in the light of revised and more efficient procedures for the recruitment and selection of persons for permanent settlement in Australia. There will be a streamlining of procedures for persons applying for temporary entry to Australia and for the granting of Australian citizenship.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Development Assistance Bureau will be retained as a separate entity but, to the maximum extent possible, its activities and personnel will be integrated with the Department of Foreign Affairs. The need to maintain separate State offices for ADAB will be reviewed, with the administration and supervision of overseas students becoming a responsibility of the Department of Education and individual tertiary institutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the major benefits flowing from this extensive review of Commonwealth activities is that resources are freed to activities which the Government believes should be significantly developed. A more efficient public sector will produce substantial benefits in enabling us to implement more fully current priorities. I make particular mention here of a case in point. A re-allocation of existing resources in the Australian Atomic Energy Commission research establishment and in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation will enable the Government to establish a new Institute of Energy and Earth Resources in the CSIRO. The establishment of this Institute is a recognition of the high priority the Government believes must be given to energy research. It will consolidate Australia's present nuclear research establishment into a first-class nuclear science and technology research organisation and establish a first-class non-nuclear research organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has also decided that the Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee-AMSTAC-should from now on report direct to the Minister for Science and Technology. Previously it was a Standing Committee of the Australian Science and Technology Council-ASTEC. It will now be separate from that body, although ASTEC will be represented on it with observer status. The Government will also explore with State governments the appropriateness and feasibility of transferring to the States the remaining Commonwealth operational elements of the administration of quarantine. That would leave policy matters in relation to quarantine with the Department of Health for people and the Department of Primary Industry for animals and plants.

       <para>
        We intend to establish major reviews into a number of significant areas of Commonwealth activity in order to further tighten administration and achieve a more efficient and effective service. First of all, I wish to announce that there will be a major review of the organisation of the Department of Defence, in the light of the five years of experience since the defence reorganisation in 1976. Generally we believe the amalgamation of the individual Service departments into a unified Defence Department has served Australia well, but we think it is now opportune to stand back and consider what further improvements might be made. The review will assess the suitability of the defence organisation to propose and implement policy for the achievement of Government defence objectives.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, we propose to engage consultants of international standing to review and report on the appropriate responsibilities and scaling down of activity of the National Capital Development Commission, having regard to the allocation of planning functions between the NCDC and the Department of the Capital Territory, including consideration of the extent of regulation of land use, design and siting.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, we also intend to establish a major external review of government laboratory facilities and services to ensure a rational and co-ordinated use of available services and facilities. As previously mentioned, a major review of Telecom Australia will be undertaken and review of the staffing levels of the Reserve Bank of Australia has been instituted by the Governor of the Bank. An independent review will be made of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies.
       </para>

        The Government is conscious of the need for a close watch to be kept on the activities of statutory and non-departmental bodies. Ministers will be examining critically the need for continued existence of all statutory bodies within their portfolios. In addition we will be proposing the establishment of a joint parliamentary standing committee to review the performance, role, functions and continued need for all statutory bodies; references to this committee will be initiated by a Minister or by either House of Parliament.

The task of reining in the growth of government is a continuous process, and we are determined to ensure that there is positive progress in implementing today's decisions.

The committee will report to Cabinet on a regular basis.

        The Review has covered a vast span of Commonwealth Government activity. Many of the changes will not be achieved quickly. Legislative action will be required in some cases, as will negotiations with State governments. Other changes involve the sale or transfer of assets to the private sector which necessarily will take some time.

        Staff Savings

       <para>
        Cumulatively these decisions will have a major impact on the size of the Commonwealth bureaucracy. The reallocation of functions between Commonwealth and States and between government and the private sector, together with the decisions in relation to the Commonwealth's own activities, will result in a reduction of 10,000 to 11,000 in the number of Commonwealth Government employees. Over and above the specific staff savings resulting from the reduction or abolition of functions, the Government has decided that it should work at achieving an objective of a further 2 per cent reduction in the number of Commonwealth Government employees in the area subject to staff ceilings over the next two years. As I have indicated, some of the changes depend upon negotiations with the States and private sector but on the basis of staffing assessments made so far it is expected that this will lead to a total reduction in staffing of 16,000 to 17,000. These estimates exclude further possible savings from the major reviews into defence administration, Telecom and the National Capital Development Commission and from other reviews and examinations of functions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The magnitude of the staff reductions involved means that a massive redeployment operation will be necessary. However, mainly in cases where the functions to be changed involve highly specific job skills, there could well be some categories of persons for whom the Commonwealth has no continuing employment and where some retrenchment will therefore be inevitable. The Government will seek to confine any retrenchments to these types of situations. In order to ensure that maximum opportunities are taken to redeploy surplus staff the Public Service Board will be oversighting closely all appointment and promotion action in departments and authorities. Staff identified as surplus will have the protections afforded by the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act and Public Service Arbitrator's Determination No. 509 of 1977. The Public Service Board will be in touch with departments and Public Service Act authorities regarding the arrangements required to keep staffing in line with the reductions to be achieved.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to emphasise that the Government believes that the Public Service has fully adequate capacity to make these reductions with consequent improvements to efficiency. The Government has a high regard for the quality of service provided by the Commonwealth Public Service. The Government recognises and appreciates the contribution that the Public Service as a whole makes and the staff savings identified do not reflect on the efficiency or dedication of the individuals involved. Rather we believe it is time to redress the balance between the public and private sectors.

       <para>
        It will be clear by now that the review of Commonwealth functions has been much more than an expenditure review exercise. Indeed many of the decisions such as those involving contracting out to the private sector or transfers to the States do not have immediate expenditure savings as their principal objective. Nevertheless, the Government has regarded the review of Commonwealth functions as making an important contribution to the objective of further reining in government spending, to make room for private sector growth and pave the way for significant reductions in the burden of taxation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Compared with the costs of continuing programs on the basis of existing policies and arrangements, the estimated overall effect of these measures will be an eventual ongoing saving in Budget outlays of the order of $560m. Government revenue will also be boosted from the sale of assets and from a broad-ranging reduction in various forms of assistance to industry through the tax system, saving some $130m. The Government's attitude to expenditure restraint will again be firmly in evidence in its approach at the forthcoming Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting and in our determination to hold down outlays in the 1981-82 Budget, where further savings can be expected.

        Conclusion
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me refer again to the context of today's decisions. They are a further expression of the Government's determination to make sure that the Commonwealth's operations are as streamlined and efficient as they can be and that there is room for the private sector to grow. The decisions I have just announced will benefit all Australians. They will contribute to the further pursuit by the Government of lower inflation, higher economic growth, lower taxes, better wages and less centralised government. These decisions are a major step in the reversal of the growth of government. A further step in the readjustment of the role and size of government to the needs of the new stage of change and development is now opening up. Since the Government came to office in 1975, inflation has been controlled, and private sector employment has increased, while the number of Commonwealth employees has fallen. We have given high priority to reducing the Commonwealth deficit. The cost of the growth of government that occurred between 1972 and 1975 was obscured by the deficits which were run up in those years; deficits which Australians have had to keep paying back ever since.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the late 1960s and early 1970s, deficit financing was popular in democratic societies. The feeling grew up that people needed only to ask, for governments to be entitled to spend. Unrealistic expectations were generated, and they in turn increased the damage caused by this approach. We have led in saying that that view is wrong, and many countries are now following Australia's example. Let me also make it plain that small and limited government bears no relationship to mean and ungenerous government. On the contrary, by strengthening the economy, limited government provides the foundation for generous social security arrangements. It has been a fundamental concern of this Government to give priority to helping those in need. They are among the beneficiaries of more efficient government. To emphasise this fact unmistakably, no reductions in income security provisions have been made as a result of this review.
       </para>
       <para>
        Economic growth also provides a foundation for bringing down taxes but only provided that government expenditure is held down. Economic growth over the next few years, in combination with continued restraint of government spending, will lead to a reduction in the relative size of the public sector and to higher real incomes for Australians. Limited government means a better working economy and a more responsible society. Bloated and excessive government means the reverse. It also encourages impossible expectations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Review of Commonwealth Functions has had to make many hard decisions. Decision about priorities are always difficult. But the Review Committee has been very clear about its priorities-that the overall well being of Australia must come first; and that the conditions of an even better future for Australia must be firmly established. Only by achieving the kind of turnaround to which this review has made such a significant contribution; only by scaling down big government; only by a relevant and balanced distribution of powers between the Commonwealth and the States; and only by the Commonwealth fixing its own priorities within the resources which it can legitimately command, can the Government discharge its responsibility to Australia and to the future of all Australians.

       <para>
        The purpose of the Bill is to remove an anomaly in the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Act 1977 which affected the amounts which lawfully could be paid to certain claimants. Honourable members will recall that the beef industry incentive payments scheme was introduced in 1977 as one of a number of Government measures to assist the then ailing beef industry. It was aimed at assisting the cash flow position of producers and enabling them to maintain desirable standards of cattle husbandry. Producers were eligible for a payment of $10 per head of cattle receiving any one of certain approved husbandry treatments during the 12 months from September 1977. Payments were limited to a maximum of $2,000 per producer. Payments made under the scheme totalled $118m. The assistance provided went a long way in helping beef cattle producers to maintain a satisfactory level of husbandry in difficult financial circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        The anomaly which the Bill sets out to correct concerns sets of producers who between them own more than one cattle herd. A typical example is where two individuals each own a herd of their own and as partners also own a third herd. As the Act stands, payment of the maximum $2,000 against a claim by the partnership rendered each of the partners ineligible for any further payment in respect of their individual herds. If, on the other hand, claims were first lodged and paid in respect of the individual herds, each of the claimants could receive $2,000 for a total between them of $4,000. The partnership would then not qualify for any payment. These provisions mean that the amounts which lawfully could be paid to groups of producers with similar herds and ownership arrangements could vary depending only on the order in which claims were lodged and paid.
       </para>
       <para>
        This anomaly was unforeseen when the Act was introduced and the Government proposes that it should now be corrected. To that end, we propose to amend the Act to enable all these interrelated claims to be assessed in the order which maximises the total of the amounts payable. This will ensure that no claimants suffer a disadvantage because of claims being lodged in one order rather than another. Most claims have already been assessed in this way and consequently the amendment will not require any substantial additional payments to be made.
       </para>
       <para>
        Initially, the Department of Primary Industry assessed claims made by sole proprietors separately from claims by partnerships. This procedure was found not to accord with the Act and to have resulted in overpayments. Claims were then reassessed and action to recover the overpayments was put in hand. The overpayments totalled $432,000 on 300 claims, some 83 per cent of which have since been recovered.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable members may recall that these matters attracted comment by the Auditor-General in his 1978-79 report to Parliament. Subsequently, they were the subject of an inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts. In re-examining related claims received from sole proprietors and partnerships the Department of Primary Industry assessed claims in the order which maximised the collective payments to the set of claimants. This was done without regard to the order in which individual claims were actually lodged or paid. Subsequent advice from the Attorney-General's Department indicated that this course was appropriate only for claims which were capable of being assessed concurrently. Without amendment to the Act it was inappropriate to include a previously paid claim in the reassessment as if it had not been paid. The requirement to take order of payment into account in assessing related claims is the anomaly which this Bill redresses.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have explained, the majority of claims already have been assessed and paid in the manner now proposed. Only a handful of existing claims, which have not been fully paid pending a government decision on the procedures to be applied, remain to be finalised. Such payments are estimated at $50,000. If the Act is not amended as the Government proposes, payments totalling some $700,000 in respect of 542 claims will legally be classed as overpayments. That situation results simply from the fact that the claimants involved did not lodge their claims in the order which gave the most beneficial result permitted by the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the specific provisions of the Bill. Sub-clause 3 (1) inserts a new section 9A in the Principal Act. The new section overcomes the anomaly to which I have referred. It provides that where the total of two or more incentive payments would vary depending on the order in which payments are made, then the payments shall be made in the order which maximises the total of those payments. Sub-clause 3 (2) provides for further payments to be made in accordance with the new section 9A against the small number of claims yet to be finalised. Sub-clause 3 (3) provides that no previous lawful payment shall be converted to an overpayment by virtue of operation of the new provision whereby the order of payment of claims is disregarded. This is considered to be a necessary safeguard even though an examination of claims has not disclosed any cases where this would occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 2 of the Bill provides that the new section 9A of the principal Act shall be deemed to have come into operation from commencement of the principal Act on 10 November 1977. The other provisions to which I have referred will come into operation on the day on which the amendment Act receives royal assent. I commend the Bill to honourable members.

        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Pig Slaughter Levy Act 1971 to raise the maximum permissible rate of levy for promotion purposes from 20c to one dollar per pig. The amendment relates only to the maximum rate of levy, not to the operative rate of levy paid by producers which is set by regulation. A levy has been paid by pig producers since 1975 to provide funds for the promotion of pig meat. Promotion is funded entirely by the industry, and expenditure has been increasing because of expanding activities at wholesale, retail and consumer levels and because of rising media costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The request for an increase in the maximum rate of levy has been made by the national body of the pig industry, the Australian Commercial Pig Producers' Federation. The Federation has sought the amendment as increases in the operative rate have taken the levy to 20c, which is the maximum currently permitted under the Act. Without this amendment there is no scope to raise the levy further and to expand promotion expenditure in the future. Any subsequent increase to the operative rate requires a recommendation from the Pig Meat Promotion Committee to the Minister. The Committee consults with the industry before making its recommendation to the Minister. I commend the Bill to honourable members.

        In statements to the House on 20 November 1979 and 10 September 1980, I announced Government decisions on the recommendations made by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report 'Privacy and the Census' which was tabled by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) on 15 November 1979. The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Census and Statistics Act 1905 to incorporate those decisions which are required for the conduct of the 1981 population census.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Law Reform Commission noted that the secrecy provision of the Census and Statistics Act 1905 was defective in that it did not apply to persons who had ceased to be officers of the Australian Bureau of Statistics; as the term 'officer' was not defined in the Act it was not clear that the census collectors were bound by the secrecy provision; and a penalty of $100 for a breach of the secrecy provision seemed hardly appropriate either as a deterrent or an affirmation of the importance of the principle of confidentiality. As an affirmation of the importance of the principle of confidentiality, the Government is moving to close the defects that have been identified and to upgrade substantially the penalty for unauthorised disclosure. In addition penalties for all other offences under the Act are also being substantially upgraded to reflect both current values and the seriousness with which these offences are viewed.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill also amends certain machinery matters relating to the conduct of the population census. It authorises the following two administrative procedures, which were recommended by the Law Reform Commission. Firstly, the use of a special sealed envelope by persons wishing to maintain the privacy of their census schedule by by-passing the census collector; and, secondly the mailing back of census schedules to the Bureau of Statistics if the usual personal collection by a census collector is, for some reason, not effective. These procedures will help preserve the essential privacy of personal details collected in the census. I commend the Bill to the House.

        I will be introducing today various Bills pursuant to the Commonwealth's obligations under the co-operative companies and securities scheme. Before I discuss the individual Bills, I would like to outline, for the benefit of honourable members, the administrative and legislative context in which the Bills will operate.

        Formal Agreement on Companies and Securities
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The formal agreement executed by the Commonwealth and all the States on 22 December 1978 provides the framework for a co-operative Commonwealth-State scheme for a uniform system of law and administration regulating companies and the securities industry. The scheme covers the relevant law operating in the six States and the Australian Capital Territory. There is also provision for the scheme to be extended to the Northern Territory and to the external territories of the Commonwealth. Background material on the Formal Agreement and on the four basic elements of the co-operative scheme is set out in paragraphs 7 to 36 of the explanatory memorandum on the Companies Bill which has been circulated to honourable members. The basic aim of the scheme is to ensure that wherever possible, any person or company should be able to deal on all general companies and securities matters as if that person or company were subject to only one system of law and administration throughout Australia. The co-operative scheme thus provides a framework for uniform general laws on companies and securities matters that will apply throughout Australia. It was, however, never intended to fetter the sovereign right of any parliament to pass particular laws which are not inconsistent with the general legislation agreed to under the scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        Keeping Company Law Uniform
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        There have been far too few examples of uniform laws being achieved across State boundaries in Australia. Company law, of course, is one area in which a measure of uniformity was achieved in the 1960s but did not continue. Under the co-operative scheme, we have a mechanism for continuing uniformity. An inevitable consequence is that I, as the Commonwealth Minister, have only 1 vote in 7 in determining the content of the legislation which I introduce into the Commonwealth Parliament as all such legislation must be approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. Indeed, after the initial legislation has been enacted it is conceivable that I would be required to introduce legislation of which I did not approve. Amending legislation requires the approval of only a simple majority of members of the Council. However, it is apparent from the spirit of co-operation and give-and-take which has emerged already in the Council's deliberations that any future legislation will also be the product of consensus.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not surprising that a scheme of this magnitude has taken some years to get off the ground. By the time that the companies code is in operation, it is expected that the parliaments of Australia will have enacted more than 50 Bills. But it is only after the initial legislation has been enacted that the real fruits of these labours will become apparent. There will no longer be any need for action by State parliaments to keep the scheme uniform as amendments passed by this Parliament will flow automatically into the laws of the States. Even when the Ministerial Council decides that the amendments should operate slightly differently from one State to another so as to pick up some local evidentiary differences-for example, this can be achieved by translator amendments-regulations will be made in one State varying the Commonwealth amendments in their operation as laws of that State.
       </para>
       <para>
        Uniform legislation is, of course, only half the package. Uniform administration of those laws by the National Companies and Securities Commission acting through the various Corporate Affairs Offices is the feature which will set the scheme apart from existing practices. Legislation setting up the National Commission was passed in 1979 and the members appointed early last year.

        The formal agreement foreshadowed a major exercise in legislative uniformity and law reform where this was necessary. In embarking on this exercise, this Government and the other governments which are parties to the formal agreement have sought to ensure that there is at all times adequate opportunity for the proposed legislation to be considered by interested persons. Comments were sought and received on the proposed acquisition of shares, securities industry and companies codes.

        The Companies Bill which I am introducing today is an amended version of the Bill which my predecessor introduced on 27 August last year. Notwithstanding a period of public exposure of an earlier draft prior to that introduction, additional comments were sought on the Bill as introduced into the House. In addition to the process of public consultation, committees of interested Government and Opposition members have continued to receive regular briefings on the scheme.

        A point has now been reached where substantial progress has been made towards bringing into operation the co-operative companies and securities scheme. The original Commonwealth Acts relating to the share acquisition code, the securities industry code and the interpretation code have already passed through this Parliament and received royal assent. Our aim is to bring these codes into operation in the Australian Capital Territory and the six States on 1 July 1981 and we are hopeful that the companies code will be operative from 1 January 1982. I would now like to discuss very briefly the first of the Bills that I am presenting today, the Companies Bill.

        Companies Bill 1981
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Having considered the submissions, I am pleased to be able to say that the reaction to the Bill has generally been favourable and that the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities has not found it necessary to make nearly as many changes to the Bill as introduced in August last year as were necessary for the earlier exposure draft. An outline of the principal features of the companies code and, in particular, the main changes it makes to existing companies legislation, is set out at paragraphs 37 to 43 of the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly the most important feature of this Companies Bill and of the previous exposure drafts which differentiates them from the existing law is the 'one place of registration' concept. These modifications to the existing law are required to ensure that an Australian company incorporated in a jurisdiction covered by the co-operative scheme can lodge all its documents with the local corporate affairs office in its jurisdiction of incorporation without the need to lodge documents anywhere else. Similarly, overseas corporations will have only to register in one of the jurisdictions covered by the co-operative scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australia-wide nature of the scheme has also been reflected in several major parts of the Bill. For example, in the areas of special investigations, schemes of arrangement and liquidations, the provisions of the existing law have been recast to overcome jurisdictional difficulties which have been faced in the past. The national emphasis of the co-operative scheme is also reflected in the clauses providing for a national system of registration for auditors, liquidators and official liquidators. The capacity of companies to change their headquarters has also been improved with the provisions relating to transfer of incorporation. There are also a number of other improvements to the existing law which have been made independently of the need to provide for an Australia-wide system of company law.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are some areas of the Bill such as the Division concerned with registration of charges which reflect both categories of change. Provision is now made for charges over company property wherever situated to be registered in only one participating State or Territory. At the same time, however, the consequences of registration or failure to register will be fundamentally different from the existing law. In brief, it reflects a change from a partial invalidity system to a priority system as recommended in the seventh interim report of the Eggleston committee. Further changes have been made in the current Bill from the exposure drafts which involve some departures from the Eggleston committee recommendations in the light of public comments. To identify quickly the other changes from the last draft of the Bill I direct the attention of honourable members to Appendix D of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. There is also a comparison, in Appendix C, of the provisions in the April 1980 and August 1980 exposure drafts.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will be apparent from an examination of the Bill and a comparison of Appendices C and D that the changes made in the current Bill generally represent fine tuning changes rather than ambitious law reform exercises. Whilst everyone agrees in the broad that there are areas of company law in need of fundamental reform, it is not as simple to achieve general agreement in the community on any particular measure of reform. Accordingly, in order to get the scheme into operation without any further delay, the changes in the current Bill, though many, are not radical.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of the areas where there have been further refinement of provisions in the exposure drafts include Divisions relating to the powers of inspection of the National Commission, ratification of contracts made before formation of companies, companies financing dealings in their own shares, the duties and liabilities of directors, disciplinary proceedings against auditors and liquidators, and substantial shareholdings.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps I should also mention some things which are not in the Companies Bill which nevertheless are of considerable practical importance. The first is that the Companies Bill does not contain provisions corresponding to the Ninth Schedule to the Companies Acts and Ordinances in force in the various States and Territories. The Ninth Schedule deals with the content of accounts and group accounts to be lodged by companies. That does not mean that company directors will be able to determine for themselves what matters to include in their accounts. It simply means that with a view to having flexible accounting provisions which have some chance of remaining relevant to the purposes for which they are designed, the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities has decided that these provisions should take the form of regulations. The aim is, or course, to enable these provisions to be amended more readily than would be the case with such provisions contained in the principal legislation. Lest this decision should give rise to any apprehension as to the ultimate content of those regulations, I hasten to add that the proposed regulations will not involve significant departures from the existing Ninth Schedule. The regulations will contain the provisions as exposed for public comment, amended in a few relatively minor ways in the light of public submissions. These proposed changes are set out in paragraph 1,300 of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are two additional matters which are not covered by this Bill but which may yet be the subject of an amending Bill when the Ministerial Council decides upon the extent to which certain disclosure principles should operate. The first is the disclosure of the operations of trading trusts. Honourable members will recall that provisions concerning disclosure by companies operating business through trusts formed part of the first exposure draft of the Companies Bill. When introducing the August Bill into the House last year my predecessor indicated that these provisions had been removed but that Ministers would be giving further consideration to the inclusion of more appropriate provisions at a later stage. The examination of this matter is still proceeding and, in the interim, the Companies Bill does not contain special provisions relating to the operation of trading trusts.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second matter highlighted by my predecessor as requiring further work was that concerning the extent to which overseas incorporated companies should disclose information as to their Australian operations. Again, this is a matter which will require further work to be done before the Ministerial Council is in a position to consider amendments to the legislation. It may well be that draft accounting requirements relating to such disclosure will need to be submitted for public comment before being submitted to the Parliament. Accordingly, legislative amendments on this subject may be some time away. Whilst drawing attention to the possibility of additional accounting requirements, I would like to mention one matter of particular concern to the accounting profession, namely, the permitted size of accounting partnerships. Ministers drew particular attention to this matter when seeking public comments on exposure drafts of the Companies Bill. The Ministerial Council will be making a decision on this matter in the near future.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should mention that I envisage introducing some amendments to this Bill during the second half of this year. I am introducing this Bill and seeking its passage at this stage, however, to enable the six State parliaments to pass legislation in the second half of this year adopting the Companies Bill. This should then enable the entire scheme to be operational by 1 January 1982. Experience with the other codes has demonstrated that the need for some modifications to the principal legislation will become apparent only when the States adopting legislation and the Commonwealth regulations are being settled. I commend the Companies Bill to the House.

        The Companies (Fees) Bill is related to the Companies Bill in that it deals with the fees payable under the Companies Bill. The actual amounts of those fees will be set out in regulations to be made under the Fees Bill. Details of the Bill are set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the benefit of honourable members. The Bill has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament. I commend the Companies (Fees) Bill to the House.

        The object of the Companies (Transitional Provisions) Bill is to enact, for the Australian Capital Territory, the transitional provisions that are necessary for the introduction of the new companies code. This Bill will come into operation on the same day as the commencement of the Companies Bill itself. The States will not be having separate Companies (Transitional Provisions) Bills. Each State will, however, include in its Companies (Application of Laws) Bill appropriate transitional provisions which will be modelled on those contained in the Bill that I am now introducing, with such modifications as are necessary to take into account the particular circumstances of that State. As with the Companies (Transitional Provisions) Bill itself, the transitional provisions in the various State (Application of Laws) Bills will require the unanimous approval of the Ministerial Council. I commend the Companies (Transitional Provisions) Bill to the House.

        The Companies (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill contains miscellaneous amendments to certain Commonwealth Acts consequent upon the repeal of the Australian Capital Territory Companies Ordinance 1962 and the enactment of the Companies Bill 1981. The Bill does not affect the States as it only relates to Commonwealth Acts. Each State will however, need to pass similar legislation in relation to any State Acts that contain references to the existing State companies Acts. Details of the Bill are contained in an explanatory memorandum that has been circulated for the benefit of honourable members. Because this Bill and the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill do not form part of the co-operative scheme legislation they therefore do not require the approval of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. The Miscellaneous Amendment Bills passed by each State will again not be part of the scheme legislation. There will also be a separate Companies (Miscellaneous Amendments) Ordinance containing consequential amendments to Australian Capital Territory Ordinances. I commend the Companies (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill to the House.

        The Crown Debts (Priority) Bill reflects the Commonwealth Government's view that the Crown in right of the Commonwealth should be placed in the same position in an insolvency situation in relation to ordinary debts as any other creditor. This decision was announced to the House by the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Fife, on 13 September 1979, following a report that was tabled in the Senate by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs concerning the right of the Crown to be repaid debts owing to it in priority to other creditors in matters of bankruptcy, corporate liquidators or other cases of impecunious persons or corporations.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate Committee, in its report, recommended the complete abrogation of all Crown priorities in insolvency administrations. The Government examined the report and was in agreement with the main thrust of the Committee's argument. The Government supports uniformity of insolvency administration which was of particular concern to the Senate Committee. It also acknowledged the desirability of placing the Crown on an even footing with the private sector so far as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs announced that the Government had decided to abolish all remaining Crown priorities in the Commonwealth sphere except in relation to tax instalment deductions and withholding tax on dividends and interest remitted overseas and to seek the abolition of all remaining Crown priorities in the State sphere. Special considerations apply in relation to these two categories of taxation debts and separate them from other Crown debts. Other changes have already been made to bankruptcy and taxation legislation in pursuance of the Government's decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Crown Debts (Priority) Bill will abrogate the prerogative priority of the Crown in right of the Commonwealth and will ensure that, in the case of the insolvency of a corporate or unincorporate body, the Commonwealth is under an obligation to repay preferential payments in circumstances where other creditors would be obliged to do so and that it is bound by any compromise or arrangement entered into by such a body. Details of the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the benefit of honourable members.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Crown Debts (Priority) Bill is not part of the co-operative scheme since it only affects the Crown in right of the Commonwealth. The Bill I am here introducing accordingly did not need the approval of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. Nevertheless, as the drafting of the terms of the Bil is interrelated with that of the Companies Bill it has been decided that both Bills should come into operation on the same say. I commend the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill to the House.

        The Securities Industry Amendment Bill (No. 2) has two separate functions. Part II of the Bill makes certain amendments of a technical nature to the substantive provisions of the Securities Industry Act. Part III of the Bill amends the Securities Industry Act 1980 to take account of certain provisions in the Companies Bill 1981. Details of the amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the benefit of honourable members.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provisions in the Bill consequential on the Companies Bill will come into operation when the Companies Bill commences and the other provisions will come into operation when proclaimed. The Securities Industry Amendment Bill (No. 2) has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament. I commend the Securities Industry Amendment Bill (No. 2) to the House.

        The Securities Industry (Fees) Amendment Bill 1981 makes a minor amendment to the Securities Industry (Fees) Act 1980. This amendment will bring these provisions into line with equivalent provisions in the Companies (Fees) Bill 1981. Details of the Securities Industry (Fees) Amendment Bill appear in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated. The Bill has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament. I commend the Securities Industry (Fees) Amendment Bill to the House.

        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to provide a legislative basis for the allocation by tender of import tariff quotas on a range of textile, clothing and footwear products. The Bill is part of a legislative package. The other Bills in this package are the Customs Securities (Penalties) Bill and the Customs Undertakings (Penalties) Bill. The decision to allocate this quota by tender follows the Government's in principle acceptance of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation as contained in its report No. 240 of 30 April 1980 entitled 'Textiles, Clothing and Footwear'.
       </para>
       <para>
        From 1 January 1982, a seven-year assistance program for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries will come into operation. It will include two forms of tariff quota to be known as base quota and tender quota. Base quota will entitle importers with established import performance to annual allocations based on 85 per cent of an initially established quota ceiling. Generally, once determined, the ceiling of quota available to base quota holders will not vary during the seven-year program.
       </para>
       <para>
        The tender quota comprises the remainder of the annual quota ceilings. The tender quota will be allocated to persons who submit successful tenders. The proportion of goods allocated by tender may be increased according to a liberalisation factor and market growth, which will be determined annually following consideration of a report by the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Advisory Committee. Tender quota entitlements and duty rates will be determined each year following the evaluation of tenders. Persons wishing to continue to acquire the tender quota will still be required to submit tenders each year. The Government considers that this tender system will provide a greater degree of flexibility within the quota regime. It will permit easier access to quota imports by new importers, and importers wishing to expand their market shares.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides for the formulation of schemes by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. Tenders will be called for and dealt with annually pursuant to these schemes. To discourage frivolous bidding, tenders will not be accepted unless accompanied by a written undertaking to the effect that, if successful, a tenderer will import all of the import quota allocated to him under the scheme. Consistent with the administration of import tariff quota generally, provision has been made for the approved transfer of all or part of the tender quota to another person. Such a transfer would acquit the undertaking by the transferor to the extent of the amount transferred. However, the obligation to import that amount will be passed on to the transferee who must give a corresponding undertaking before the transfer will be approved.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other parts of the legislative package provide for the imposition of penalties in cases where a successful tenderer does not give a security for compliance with his undertaking, when required to do so, or if he subsequently breaches the undertaking. The Bill contains a provision to amend section 42 of the Customs Act to enable the Customs to require and take the appropriate securities for payment of any penalty that may be incurred by reason of a breach of an undertaking. The Bill also makes provision for the determination of two of the factors relevant to the amount of penalty which may be imposed under the other two Bills. I commend the Bill to the House.

        The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of a penalty for a refusal or failure to give certain securities to Customs when required to do so in relation to the importation into Australia of certain tariff quota goods. This Bill forms part of a package of Bills designed to give effect to the Government's decision to allocate by way of a tender scheme, a proportion of the import tariff quota available on a range of textile, clothing and footwear products. If a tender furnished pursuant to the proposed Customs Amendment (Tenders) Act 1981 is accepted it will be necessary for the successful tenderer, if required by Customs, to give a security that may be applied as a penalty if the undertaking given under that proposed Act is breached.
       </para>
       <para>
        This measure is designed to discourage persons from submitting frivolous tenders. Such tenders would operate to the disadvantage of the genuine tenderers if they influenced the tender duty rate. Undue delays in determining tender duty rates and quota entitlements which resulted from frivolous tenders would make it difficult for genuine tenderers to vary their overseas orders and still fully utilise their 'tender quota' within the quota period. The penalty payable under the Bill will be equivalent to the penalty that would be payable under the proposed Customs Undertakings (Penalties) Act 1981 for a total breach of an undertaking given pursuant to the proposed Customs Amendment (Tenders) Act 1981. I commend the Bill to the House.

        The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the imposition of penalties for breaches of undertakings required to be given under the proposed Customs Amendment (Tenders) Act 1981. This Bill forms part of a package of Bills designed to give effect to the Commonwealth Government's decision to allocate by way of a tender scheme a proportion of the import tariff quota available on a range of textile, clothing and footwear products. It is an essential element of this tender scheme that the import tariff quota offered by tender should be fully utilised. Successful tenderers should not be able to restrict imports through underutilisation of the 'tender quota'. Such action could increase the scarcity value of quota goods and could cause shortages in the local market. This Bill provides for the imposition of a penalty where a person, who has given an undertaking to import 'tender quota' goods under the proposed Customs Amendment (Tenders) Act 1981 and has been allocated a specified quantity or value, does not fully utilise his 'tender quota' allocation. Any penalty payable will be proportionate to the quantity or value of 'tender quota' goods not imported. I commend the Bill to the House.

        This Bill has two essential purposes. Firstly, specific purpose grants to government and non-government schools in the States and the Northern Territory, which are administered by the Schools Commission, are adjusted for cost increases and the Bill authorises this in respect of 1980 and 1981. Secondly, prior to the last election, the Government made a number of commitments both to extend programs and to introduce new programs and this Bill gives effect to those commitments, the details of which I shall give later in this speech.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1979 will finalise the adjustment of 1980 grants. The additional grants in respect of the increase in the cost of the salary and wage content of recurrent grants will involve a further appropriation of $7.3m. The amendment of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1980 provides for an adjustment of $27.7m for 1981 programs. Included also is provision for the new programs. These programs are designed to provide a higher level of assistance to those areas which have been identified as having the greatest need.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the first stage of the Government's commitment to provide over three years a total of $25m for capital grants for new places in non-government schools throughout Australia, $7.4m will be made available in 1981 under the legislation before the House. This is in conformity with the Government's resolve to ensure equality of opportunity and freedom of choice for all Australian school children and their parents. The legislation also provides funds for the first stage of the Government's undertaking to compress the existing levels of non-government schools, as defined by the Schools Commission, to three levels and to continue the linkage of non-government schools general recurrent funding to a percentage of government school running costs. The Government has undertaken to complete this process within the life of the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        To give effect to the Government's announced promise to develop education programs for severely handicapped children, the Bill also makes provision for the introduction of a new scheme to facilitate the development of such programs in institutions or in the homes of severely handicapped children. This initiative follows the release of a report on the National Survey of Special Education undertaken for the Schools Commission by the Fred and Eleanor Schonell Education Research Centre, and is in addition to existing Commonwealth expenditure on the education of handicapped children amounting to $19.3m in 1981 under the Commonwealth Schools Commission's special education and integration programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, the Bill also implements a further election policy commitment for the introduction of a program to assist non-profit part time ethnic schools. Under the program an annual maximum of $30 a head may be paid to these schools in respect of children undertaking approved supplementary community language and cultural education programs. The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill 1980 will again be adjusted for further cost increases later this year. I commend the Bill to the House.

        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1978. In accordance with established procedures, for current programs the Bill makes appropriate adjustments for movements in costs applicable to grants for tertiary education covered under the existing legislation. The Grants were last adjusted in the Budget sittings in 1980. The adjustments to the grants for all sectors amount to an appropriation of $115m in respect of the years 1980 and 1981.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the Bill will provide for a deferral of an amount of $117,000 from the 1980 program of specified building projects in the advanced education sector to the 1981 capital program for the same sector. The replacement of schedule 7A, the 1980 capital programs, in this amendment will also enable adjustments to be made to amounts in the schedule which have been the subject of approved variations since the schedule was enacted. The Bill will increase by $6,500 both the 1980 and 1981 grants in respect of contributions to the National Institute of Dramatic Art to provide for rental increases. The Bill will also provide for the transfer of portions of the 1981 recurrent capital and equipment grants currently available in the principal Act for the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education-TCAE-to the University of Tasmania. The amendments implement agreed arrangements for the transfer of certain courses from the Mount Nelson campus of TCAE to the University of Tasmania.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will adjust the per capita rate applicable to grants for non-government business colleges to allow payment of full supplementation in respect of these grants. Anomalous wording in the principal Act currently precludes final adjustments from being made on a retrospective basis. The Bill will provide for minor technical amendments such as a revision of the definition of college purposes in section 5 and the definition of full time students in sub-sections 6 (2) and (3) in the principal Act. These minor amendments do not alter the intention of the original provisions. The Bill will also introduce a transitional provision to recognise the repeal of the State legislation which established the Victorian Institute of Colleges and State College of Victoria systems. Responsibility for those systems is now vested in the Victorian Post-secondary Education Commission. I commend this Bill to the House.

        —I note first of all that the two Bills we are debating today-the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill and the Repatriation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill-were introduced into this House yesterday and are being debated today. I informed the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) that we on this side of the House would co-operate in getting these Bills through. But I also told him that we would make quite clear our opposition to the way in which this has been done. We are co-operating because we believe that the pharmacists have a justifiable case for as early a settlement as possible in relation to their remuneration, and therefore we wish to contribute towards that immediate solution. Nevertheless, there is no excuse for the House or the Opposition being treated in this way. There is no massive backlog of health legislation. In fact, there has been a complete dearth of health legislation in the past few months. So it is not that the Government has the excuse that it has had a lot of legislation to deal with rapidly.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill is a relatively simple Bill. It is designed to set up a remuneration tribunal for pharmacists. It is based very much on the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiring into pharmacists remuneration. Those proposals are nearly nine months old. It is a relatively simple Bill, the outline and key elements of which were recommended to the Government nine months ago. The Minister has clearly stated for the last 12 months that by 1 July a determination was to be given to pharmacists. That was another reason for a little more careful advanced planning. We on this side of the House say-I hope that many honourable members on the other side would agree-that it is just not good enough to treat measures in this way; to have to debate them the day after they are introduced. There are customary understandings in this House concerning time for these measures to be given proper consideration in the party committees. That has been virtually denied in this case because of the procedure which has been adopted. The Government's approach is typical of the vacillation and procrastination on health issues which has typified this Minister and this Government. As a result we are now pressurised into the current situation.
      </para>
      <para>
       There have been months of procrastination on the issue of pharmacists' remuneration. The pharmacists have had no increase in the dispensing fee in the three years since 1977-78 despite an inflation rate of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent in that period, calculated however one likes. The Minister has been well aware of this problem. Pharmacists have certainly been busily agitating on the issue and I think that their agitation has a fair amount of justification. Not only have they had no rise but also they have had certain punitive measures taken against them by the Minister arising out of the much debated overpayments issue. Whatever view we take on that, in addition to having had no rise, there was a 4c reduction per prescription in 1980. Again there was no flow-on from the manufacturers price rise last November. So the pharmacists have received no increase and certain punitive measures have been taken against them.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition, I think it can be argued that their problems have been compounded, particularly this year, by tardy governmental payments to them. In the early part of this year there certainly was a significantly increased lag in payments to pharmacists by the Department of Health and particularly by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Further their problems have been compounded because there has been a decline in the volume of prescriptions. For some months the Minister has been aware of those problems but has procrastinated on the question of an interim payment for pharmacists. Indeed, it is not clear yet whether the Government has made any response to the Ludeke request in March for a governmental response to the Pharmacy Guild's application. The issue has been put off fortnight by fortnight. One can trace the answers to questions, by the Minister back to some time in March. Any response from the Government has been put off fortnight by fortnight. The last date we were given for a response was 27 April. There was no indication in the Minister's speech which was delivered on 29 April about what response had been made to that interim application if any had been made at all. Here we have a problem that has been apparent for some time. Yet we have had, as I say, a gross discourtesy paid to this House in the way that this recognised problem has been treated.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, we do recognise the degree of urgency in this case. We, on this side of the House, have not the resources nor the detailed information to make judgments about the exact degree of price increase involved. We do recognise however, considerable justice in the pharmacists' claim. We do recognise that there is a considerable degree of urgency. We do recognise the procrastination from which pharmacists have suffered. Of course, they are not unique in this regard in the health field. So many organisations have suffered the kind of procrastination which has gripped the Health Department for 18 months, though there are now signs of galvanised activity. We will co-operate with the Government in trying to get this Bill through the House as quickly as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       If the 1 July date for the determination is to be realised-if the commitment of the Minister to provide a determination of pharmacists remuneration is to be achieved-a considerable amount of work has to be done even after the passage of this Bill. Once the Bill is passed and goes through its formal promulgation, a chairman of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal has to be appointed. The Minister has indicated that he has a person to fill the position of chairman ready and waiting. He certainly needs to be ready and waiting given the job he needs to do in the next eight weeks. Support machinery has also to be established for the chairman. However, I presume there can be considerable use of the resources previously available to the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements. Then the chairman has to call for submissions and evidence, all of which has to be advertised. So it seems difficult indeed to imagine that the actual submissions and evidence could come before the Tribunal much before the beginning of June. Even that is a pretty optimistic date. The Tribunal is given power to determine criteria-a very difficult problem-and to reach a determination. I suggest, in all politeness, that perhaps the best thing the Tribunal could do is to reach an interim decision by 1 July, because I do not think the major tasks will be accomplished by that date.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Bill follows very closely the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I congratulate the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and all members of that Committee from both sides of the House for the proposals that they have made. I congratulate them because they have stimulated the Health Department into activity and I doubt that the Health Department was capable of producing some solution to the long-running saga of the problem of the Joint Committee. The Bill establishes a Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to replace the present Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements. Let me make some contrasts between the Joint Committee and the Tribunal. The Joint Committee consisted of a chairman and representatives from two bodies. Four members were from the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and four representatives were from the Department of Health. The Chairman was a Deputy President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The chairman of the tribunal again is to be a Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The other two members are to be independent members. In this sense the rather privileged position that the Pharmacy Guild and, to a lesser extent, the Department of Health possessed has been removed. The composition of the Tribunal has been changed. The Tribunal is a much more independent body. It does not now involve the direct participants in the dispute in the composition of the Tribunal itself. The Tribunal will now sit in judgment of the participants.
      </para>
      <para>
       I said a moment ago that the reaching of the determination by 1 July would require considerable speed. I should note, of course, that only the chairman will conduct that first stage of the Tribunal. The other two members will not participate. One hopes that, as soon as possible, the full Tribunal will be meeting. I accept the Minister's explanation on the appointment of the chairman only at this stage. He has the power, of course, to act without the other two Tribunal members. The situation in relation to the Tribunal is a much more independent one compared with that of the Joint Committee. That is the first and distinct advantage.
      </para>
      <para>
       Secondly, the Joint Committee conducted its business in private. It might be said that this Committee was rather an in group committee. It comprised members from the Pharmacy Guild and members from the Department of Health with somebody holding the ring between them. I have great admiration for the man who was required to hold the ring between those contestants. In many ways it was a rather private in group body. Of course, its discussions and deliberations were held in private. By contrast, the Tribunal will take issues into a much more public arena. Most of its work will be conducted in public, although there is provision in the Bill for the chairman to use his discretion on matters of confidence. Interested parties are given an opportunity to participate in the debate. The Friendly Societies Pharmacies Association, the Pharmaceutical societies of Australia and the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations are groups which have expressed a desire to participate in this place on pharmaceutical remuneration. I think that is a preferred situation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Various groups which have a concern and interest will make submissions to the Tribunal and argue the case in public. Those contrasts-that is, the contrast between an in group and a much more independent body and the contrast between a rather private discussion and a public inquiry-are ones of which we approve. However, we have to be careful. Some problems will be involved in this kind of open adversary situation. I think this will be an experiment. Let it be noted that in these types of tribunals there are dangers of rather very broad or rather extreme positions being advocated in the hope that a compromise can be found somewhere down the middle. I hope that this Tribunal will work in a much more realistically way. Certainly we will want to watch the functioning of the adversary situation for determining pharmacists' remuneration.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to turn now to the possibility that such a splendid tribunal could be applied to other organisations in the health care field. Pharmacists are not the only group in this field very dependent on public subsidy. Members of my party would like to see such tribunals making decisions in relation to other professional groups in the health care field which are very much dependent for their incomes, either directly of indirectly, on subsidies provided by the taxpayers. I note that that was also the view of the Public Accounts Committee. The Committee in its report entitled 'Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme-Chemists' Remuneration' stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . Commonwealth Government, through the Department of Health faces almost identical requirements to adjust remuneration not only for chemists, but also for doctors, optometrists and other providers of health services. Such remuneration is presently determined either in special forums, or by specific tribunals. The PAC considers that it would be more economical, administratively convenient and would enable the development of greater expertise if determination of medical and para medical remuneration all vested in a judicial organisation having a nexus with the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think that there is much in that recommendation to be considered, particularly after one sees how the tribunal works in relation to pharmacy remuneration. We on this side of the House certainly would be sympathetic to that extension, particularly if the tribunal appears to work well. I note that the Minister in his second reading speech said that he was considering the other recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee. I hope that he is giving serious consideration to them.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another Public Accounts Committee consideration which I would like to mention is the proposal to establish a bureau of health economics. I think, particularly given the decisions of yesterday, that this country is very much in need of a bureau of health economics. The Public Accounts Committee suggested that we need a relatively independent monitoring unit which will provide us with information to allow us to judge the quite dramatic and, I would suggest, draconian changes that are now taking place in the health system. We need to secure national information about the working of the health system, particularly if the Government is successful in abdicating its responsibilities for hospitals. I think that the need has grown for this kind of national information and this national monitoring role to be played by a relatively independent group. Therefore I think the recommendation to establish a bureau of health economics deserves consideration by the Minister, particularly as it may help him to judge the success or otherwise all the schemes on which he has now embarked.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let me say finally that the experience of the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements has not been a happy one. It has had a long history of continual conflict. I do not believe that at any time the present method of setting fees has proved a very satisfactory one. Indeed, the history of that Committee is simply one of ructions, quarrels and conflicts. I think the responsibility for that lies with both sides. I do not want to say that one participant or the other is responsible. I think that the history of the Joint Committee in recent years-and I do not excuse different governments from this-has been rather unsatisfactory. I hope that the Tribunal which we now propose to set up will break that rather unhappy situation which has developed in the determination of pharmacists' remuneration. I believe that the basic principles behind the establishment of the Tribunal offer a real hope that we may be able to get this vexed issue on to a basis-it will never be a non-conflict basis-where all those who participate in the Tribunal will have confidence about the judgments made by the Tribunal. A lot depends on the original appointments made to the Tribunal; a lot depends on how the Tribunal first works; and a lot depends on a determination being made quickly even if that determination has to be an interim one because of the much wider issues I have talked about which may require more detailed consideration. We on this side of the House look forward to the operation of the Tribunal. We will follow its activities closely. We hope it will display much greater speed in decision-making than some others in the field of health. We wish it well.

        —The honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) in his opening remarks expressed concern about the haste with which this legislation is to be passed. I share his concern in that regard. I must say that I am most appreciative of his co-operation and the co-operation of the Opposition in allowing the course that is being taken. When I entered this Parliament almost seven years ago I made it abundantly clear that although I was a pharmacist I carried no particular brief for pharmacy. I confirmed, as I do now, that I represent my electorate of Petrie and concern myself with the problems and issues that affect my electorate. Over the years, first in Opposition and then in government, I have maintained an ongoing interest in health and welfare matters.

       One important facet of the Government's health policy is the operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. As the only pharmacist on the Government benches and, indeed, as the only pharmacist in this chamber, surely it is not unusual that I have maintained a deep interest in pharmacy and the Government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. As a master pharmacist I have been conscious not to be seen to be pushing a personal barrow, although I must say that I have not noticed a reluctance on the part of some other honourable members and senators to pursue a subject on behalf of their constituents where they personally have a like interest or investment. Whether they are manufacturers, ex-union bosses, farmers, tradesmen, doctors or labourers, members on both sides of this chamber have taken up the cause of individuals and groups. Therefore I consider myself reasonably well qualified to speak on behalf of Australia's 5,000 master pharmacists.

       The local chemist is a vital link in the health delivery chain. I doubt whether there is a single person in this nation who in the last year or two has not sought the sound advice of his local pharmacist. Many people are regular visitors to their chemist, who, apart from dispensing their prescriptions and advising them on general matters of health, is always ready to listen and offer kind words and help and advise on a whole host of problems affecting the personal lives of people. The local chemist, like the local doctor, is one of the nation's most significant and important social workers.
      </para>
      <para>
       I ask honourable members to name another retail business in any shopping centre where the general public can enter freely and receive this high standard of professional advice without any monetary payment? The only return a chemist receives for his services is the profit on the items sold, and there are many instances when advice is given and no product is sold. Therefore, it is essential that the nation retain a viable retail pharmacy industry. If there is a substantial diminution of services provided by pharmacy undoubtedly the general health of our people will suffer. It should be pointed out that retail pharmacy was providing a second to none service to Australian communities long before the Federal Government first ventured into the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in 1947. The scheme was expanded considerably in the early 1960s and the original patient charge of 50c per item has progressively been increased to today's level of $2.75.
      </para>
      <para>
       The establishment of a tribunal to determine the level of remuneration to pharmacists for dispensing replaces the existing Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements. It will be the first time that hearings of claims by pharmacists for dispensing fee increases will be heard in public. Previously the negotiations have been conducted in private. It has been only in the last few years that an independent arbitrator has arbitrated on deadlocks between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. With 93 per cent of all dispensing being in the form of pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions it is easy to see how the level of payment of dispensing fees has a major effect on the profitability of pharmacy. It is my considered opinion that past governments have used their positions of power through the increasing dependence of retail pharmacy on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to squeeze the industry to breaking point. Governments are always looking to reduce expenditure. What better way of doing that than in an area where they have almost total power?
      </para>
      <para>
       No other business in this country is so subject to direct influence and power of government as is pharmacy. Certainly no group of professionals in private business is so controlled by government. Recently, through sheer desperation and frustration, the pharmacists of this nation embarked on a campaign to make contact with their local Federal member of parliament and senators to make them aware of their plight. I believe members on both sides of this chamber-if not all members, the vast majority of them-are convinced that retail pharmacy is in a deal of financial trouble and that increases in dispensing fees are essential if many hundreds of local chemist shops are to be saved from going out of business.
      </para>
      <para>
       This legislation provides for a fees determination by the new Tribunal by 1 July 1981. The Government must act promptly to pay the fee increases, otherwise further financial hardships will be endured. It is now four years since pharmacists have had a fee increase. Indeed, chemists' professional fees were reduced by 4c from 1 May 1980, resulting from so-called overpayments to chemists arising out of a stated computer error several years ago. Because of the actions of past governments through the unreasonable stances of some Department of Health officers not only is retail pharmacy in some trouble but also the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry has suffered. The Ralph Inquiry into the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Industry confirmed what the industry had known and complained of for some time. Governments had been forcing down prices through dictatorial methods used by some departmental officers to such an extent that the industry was in grave trouble.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Ralph inquiry recommended assistance to the industry through increased payments. This is but another instance of what happens when governments get their sticky fingers too deeply into an industry. However, when the Government acted and decided to pay the pharmaceutical manufacturer an across the board increase of 20c an item last year it reduced the chemists' professional fee by a further 5c, this being equal to the 25 per cent mark-up on the extra 20c paid for the manufacturer's product.
      </para>
      <para>
       The profit margin on cost enjoyed by the chemist is a low 25 per cent for pharmaceutical benefit items. A few years ago it was 33 1/3 per cent. Many retail outlets apply mark-ups of 50 per cent, 66 2/3 per cent and some even 100 per cent and greater. Most chemist shop lines-that is, over the counter lines-are marked up by 50 per cent and 66 2/3 per cent on cost, although on some the mark-up is as low as 33 1/3 per cent. With pharmaceutical benefit items the chemist receives a mere 25c profit on an item that costs $1. With this low profit margin on cost it is essential that the dispensing fee, his professional fee for service, be at a fair and sensible level.
      </para>
      <para>
       This legislation, although providing for retrospective payments in the transitional period, does not empower the Tribunal to make retrospective payments to pharmacists when making a determination. Personally, this aspect does not perturb me greatly because, unlike previous arrangements when fee increases were adjusted every two or three years, this legislation requires the Tribunal to determine fees at least every 12 months. Under previous arrangements, because of the infrequency of fee determinations, retrospectivity had to apply. However, because fee determinations are unlikely to be made more frequently than 12 monthly, I believe the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) should indicate that the Tribunal should take a prospective view when setting fees.
      </para>
      <para>
       Chemists' overheads, like those of all other businesses, are subject to inflation, particularly the large overhead component of staff wages. Increases in overheads must be paid when demanded. Therefore, I would like the Minister, in his summing up of this debate, to indicate his support for the Tribunal to take into consideration inflation in prospect when making its determination. Any other retail business, or indeed manufacturing or commercial undertaking, is not forced to absorb increases in overheads for 12 months. Therefore, I believe pharmacies should not be singled out. I repeat that I believe the Minister ought to give support to this view, show leadership and indicate that this should be one of the criteria taken into consideration by the Tribunal.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now turn to the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals insofar as it affects pharmacy and the dispensing of prescriptions. Existing hospital cost sharing arrangements have encouraged greater utilisation of outpatient facilities at public hospitals. This has been at the expense of community-based medical practitioners and pharmacists. Why so many members of the general public would want to sit for hours in hospital outpatient departments when they can, in most cases, get better and quicker service from their local doctor and chemist baffles me. Obviously hospitals have a fascination for some people. I agree with the finding of the Jamison inquiry that patients should be encouraged to visit local general practitioners rather than the relatively costly outpatient departments of hospitals. The clause in the present Medibank agreements with the States which precludes prescriptions written in recognised hospitals from being dispensed in community pharmacies, except in emergencies, is ludicrous and should be abolished.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under present arrangements this Government is sharing 50 per cent of the cost of dispensing all drugs in recognised hospitals whereas a large proportion of this cost should be borne by the individual when he takes his prescription to the local chemist. At the present time the average prescription cost is approximately $4.50 with the patient paying $2.75. This means that the Government is paying $1.75 an item. With the hospital dispensing this item, governments are paying the full $4.50. The Commonwealth is paying half, or about $2.25. Similarly, only with greater cost to the Government, patients seen by hospital doctors-I hope that the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) is listening to me-are costing the Government more than if those patients were seen by their local community doctor. It is far better for the patient to build up relationships with his local general practitioner and pharmacist than be subjected to so many different doctors in hospitals and suffer impersonal treatment in such an institution.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now turn to the subject of delayed payments to pharmacists. I have been advised by the Pharmacy Guild that hardship has been caused to pharmacists in some States because of late payment for dispensing prescriptions which come under the National Health Scheme and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This can cause severe liquidity problems for many pharmacists who have been forced to lose settlement discounts with wholesalers and pay greater amounts of interest on overdrafts. It must be remembered that, whilst some wholesalers require payment of accounts within 30 days of the end of the month, many wholesalers nowadays require settlement within 14 days. The problem has been brought about by inadequate staffing levels in the New South Wales division of the Department of Health and a poorly managed transition when the processing of veterans' affairs prescriptions was taken over by the Department of Health. The situation with veterans' affairs payments has improved but the measures taken to improve the position-that is, by sending some of the workload to other States-has caused delays in other States, particularly Victoria. Whereas previously there was a big problem in one State we now have a smaller problem in several States. I ask the Minister to investigate thoroughly this matter of delays in payments to chemists because I am not convinced that the answers given by departmental officers to me recently are completely correct.
      </para>
      <para>
       I now turn my attention to the matter of whether there are too many chemist shops in Australia. The Pharmacy Guild has long recognised that there are too many pharmacy outlets in Australia. The population to pharmacy ratio is too low. Undoubtedly one of the reasons for this situation is the fact that the profitability of pharmacy was much better in the 1960s than in the last 10 years. The industry had an expectation that was based on the level of remuneration available. When that profitability dropped too many pharmacists became unprofitable; hence, the closure of shops and the difficult times that have befallen others. On a number of occasions this Government has implied that the industry's problems arise because there are too many pharmacies. Late last year the Pharmacy Guild put a proposition to the Minister for Health aimed at improving the position in relation to the oversupply of chemist shops. I understand that the Minister has not as yet responded to this submission.
      </para>
      <para>
       The control of the number of chemist shops is a very vexed question. On the one hand, the licensing of chemist shops comes under State jurisdiction. On the other hand, the approvals to dispense pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions is a Commonwealth responsibility. We have the absurd situation that, if in one area two chemists decide to merge and close the doors of one shop or one pharmacist sells to another who closes the door of one shop, the very next day another registered pharmacist can come along, open another pharmacy, be licenced by the State Government and be given immediate approval by the Commonwealth to dispense National Health Scheme prescriptions. There is no easy solution to effecting a rationalisation of pharmacies; nevertheless, it should not be put in the too hard basket. As far as I am concerned, the issue ought to be the subject of intense investigations and discussions by a meeting of Commonwealth and State health Ministers. At this stage, I seek leave to incorporate two tables in Hansard.

        —I thank the House. The first table illustrates population to pharmacy ratios in Australia. It commences with the year 1950, when an average of 2,697 people supported every pharmacy. The table finishes with the figure for 1980, when 14,615,900 people supported 5,417 pharmacies-2,698 people per pharmacy. The table clearly indicates that the population to pharmacy ratio worsened from 1950, until the mid 1960s. Fortunately, there has been a healthy trend over the last few years.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The second table indicates the number of pharmacies in Australia since 1972, when there was a total of 5,891. The most significant figures show that by 1978 there had been a loss of some 500 pharmacies. The number dropped to 5,392. There was a steady decline over those six years. In 1979 there was an increase of seven pharmacies throughout Australia and in 1980 there was an increase of a further 18 pharmacies. But in the nine months to 31 March 1981 there was a decrease of 24 pharmacies. It is obvious that the financial situation of pharmacies today is not good and therefore we are seeing a forced reduction in the number of pharmacies-and, of course, a reduction of service to the community.
      </para>
      <para>
       The final question I wish to raise concerns the concessional or subsidised Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Since the abolition of the subsidised health benefits plan in 1976 there has been no means whereby disadvantaged persons such as the unemployed, lone parents, low income families or persons with chronic illnesses have had access to concessions on pharmaceutical benefits. For the purpose of bulk billing for medical benefits, doctors have now been granted the power to decide which members of the public are disadvantaged. Surely an anomaly exists in that the Government is paying the doctor 75 per cent of the common fee-it will be 85 per cent as a result of the announcement yesterday by the Minister for Health-for the consultation whilst the patient in many instances is unable to afford the $2.75 contribution for each item prescribed by the medical practitioner. It is not an uncommon occurrence for a family to have two or three chronically ill children and it would not be uncommon for such a family in one week to receive up to eight or 10 prescriptions from its local doctor which, at $2.75 each, cost it more than many families can afford. I propose that a system similar to the subsidised health benefits plan that operated prior to 1976 be introduced whereby a reduced patient contribution is paid per prescription item for those patients who are nominated as disadvantaged. Beneficiaries would include supporting parents, the unemployed and sickness and special beneficiaries.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Pharmacy Guild believes that the Government should introduce a concessional pharmaceutical benefits category with a lower patient contribution. The Guild believes concessional pharmaceutical benefits should be made available to all persons nominated by doctors as disadvantaged for the purpose of bulk billing, such as patients suffering from nominated chronic diseases which necessitate continuous medication, Aboriginals and children under the age of 16 years. I believe it would be simple for prescription forms to have on them a box which could be marked 'CPB' or something similar and these prescriptions could then be put in a separate bundle by the chemist for forwarding for payment. I support both Bills and I commend my suggestions to the Minister.

        —The Opposition supports the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill and the Repatriation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill whilst noting the deficiencies in the decision-making processes of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) which have delayed their appearance before this House. Since last October's election, and despite his relatively long period in office-for the Fraser Ministry-this Minister has been incapable of presenting to this Parliament legislation on a variety of matters which he has had under consideration for some time. In other areas he has had the problem of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to deal with and, as we have found out in recent days, that is not an inconsiderable problem. However, it must be doubted whether in this aspect of his legislative responsibility he has encountered the same degree of Prime Ministerial interference. Therefore, it must be assumed that delays in legislation appearing before us are due to sloppiness in his own procedures and decision-making processes. We thus have thrust upon us what is in fact a fairly simple piece of legislation which could have been brought down at any time after the Joint Statutory Committee of Public Accounts report of September last year. However, it has been delayed until now and the new Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal will be given a baptism of fire by being ordered to report by July this year. It has been requested to complete a review in two months which the Government, through the old Joint Committee, has been unable to complete in three years. I wish it luck.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       As I have said, this simple piece of legislation could have been introduced in December last year. It could have been introduced at the beginning of this session. Tortuous as are the Minister's ways of arriving at decisions, nevertheless he was talking about setting up the Tribunal at the beginning of February. This might have at least given us something useful to debate in the last couple of months and given the new chairman of the Tribunal reasonable time to arrive at some reasonable conclusions. Pressure might also have been taken off this new tribunal if the Minister had used the Joint Committee for an interim settlement of the pharmacists' claims for an increase in prescription charges. The joint committee of public servants and pharmacists, in 20 years of operations, proved utterly incapable of arriving at an agreed methodology for determining the cost of dispensing a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescription. However, it might have enjoyed a useful swan-song had it been instructed to produce, without prejudice to subsequent investigations, a temporary cost of living adjustment using the base amount of $1.31 a prescription, agreed upon by the parties last year. The new tribunal might then have had some time to bring down a considered review without, as it now must, running the risk of alienating interested parties with a hasty decision. The tardiness of this move generally can be seen when one recalls that in November 1976 the then Minister for Health said that the aim of the Commonwealth was to remove from the political arena the important question of fees paid to chemists, to bring an end to the acrimony that had developed over the years between chemists and successive Commonwealth governments, and to achieve smooth administration of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. According to the Minister's speech, they are all reasons for the introduction of this legislation four years later.
      </para>
      <para>
       If the Minister wishes to make excuses, the only one acceptable on this side of the House is the effect of Public Service staff ceilings. Nobody who sits on the Public Accounts Committee, as I do, can fail to be impressed by the frequent reference in the recent Auditor-General's report to the damaging effect these have had on Public Service efficiency. However, given his involvement in the decisions which have produced this situation, not even this amounts to an excuse for his administration. The Opposition, as the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) has indicated, has maintained for some time that it does not oppose an increase in this aspect of the pharmacists' remuneration. We are aware that the growth in income per pharmacy from benefits has risen by about 4 per cent since 1977-78 whilst average weekly earnings have risen by about 25 per cent. One pharmacy in my electorate-Blackburn and Hewitt Enterprises-has written to me advising that it cannot absorb rising costs. It is being forced to absorb drug wholesalers' surcharges and the rising costs of borrowing. It faces a liquidity crisis made more critical by the less than buoyant retail sales it is experiencing. It has had to reduce its staff by three and I am told that further redundancies may well follow.
      </para>
      <para>
       Throughout the country we are faced with a future of pharmacy closures which will mean a reduction in services to people who need them. It has been argued that some rationalisation in outlets should take place. Indeed the Public Accounts Committee viewed such a development with some favour. It pointed out that around 5,400 pharmacies in Australia were servicing about 2,650 people each. In my electorate about 37 pharmacies are serving a slightly greater average number of people. The Public Accounts Committee pointed out that the average United Kingdom pharmacy serves about 5,000 people and the Swedish pharmacy about 14,000 people. I am not sure that these comparisons are, in fact, very useful. British and Swedish cities are much more closely settled than ours. To illustrate this point I refer to a conversation that I once had with a British member of parliament. As honourable members would be aware, the average size, in population terms, of a British electorate is much the same as ours. That member of parliament represented an area in London which was very similar in its social composition to my electorate of Swan. The constituents in my electorate of Swan are spread over an area of about 120 square miles. The British member of parliament pointed out to me that in his electorate they live in an area of about four square miles. That gives an indication of the likely convenience of services available to persons in his area. It is to be expected that greater inconveniences confront the Australian customer. In comparison with the British user, I would say they are very much greater.
      </para>
      <para>
       The trend in Australia has been towards decreasing availability of pharmacies. In 1970 some 5,876 pharmacies were servicing an average of 2,155 persons. In 1980 5,417 pharmacies served 2,650 persons. The question of availability is becoming increasingly important in my home State as a result of the State Government's closure of facilities in major hospitals. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges), the previous speaker in this debate, referred to those facilities. A very fine service provided at the Royal Perth Hospital where all users of the general clinic had prescriptions filled free of charge has been shut down. Many pensioners and disadvantaged persons had been able to get, at great convenience, long term free supplies of pharmaceuticals from doctors familiar with their cases. This required only occasional visits. If they continue to use this service they must now have their disadvantaged status determined by the hospital doctors. They are entitled to only two weeks supply of medicines. Pensioners may, but without certainty, get an extension. As was the Government's intention, these persons must now use their general practitioners who may or may not be conveniently located to pharmacies or to the pensioners. An even more serious situation has arisen at the Shenton Park Rehabilitation Centre, which handles disabled persons and war veterans. It has similarly been restricted to two weeks supplies. Disabled outpatients are confronted with the problem of more frequent visits to GPs and pharmacies which may not be convenient.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recently I conducted a phone-in at my electorate office on the restrictions of these pharmaceutical benefits, among other health matters. I received numerous telephone calls related to these issues. One lady who is now almost blind has been forced to cease using the Royal Perth Hospital and to start using her local general practitioner. He has to apply regularly to the Government to secure authority for one of her essential medications. This had been readily available to her from the RPH clinic until the restrictions that I mentioned came into force. The question of convenience is vitally important in my electorate. We have more aged and invalid pensioners in Swan than in any other electorate in Western Australia. They cannot be expected to travel distances to fill utterly essential needs. Therefore I have some sympathy with the view expressed by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia in a recent submission it sent to me which revealed that if the bottom 42 per cent, in profitability terms, of pharmacies were closed it would produce less than a 5 per cent saving in costs on pharmaceutical benefits, and that is assuming the recipients went nowhere else. However, if prescription payments are to rise there is an immediate need for the Government to review some related matters of hardship. Some of these, I am pleased to say, were raised by the honourable member for Petrie, I think in a sympathetic manner, even if his solutions were not entirely adequate. The Government's definition of the disadvantaged in relation to those who are entitled to receive Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listed medicines free of charge must be drastically altered.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has listed the unemployed people as disadvantaged in its calculations as to who will have to pay for their own health costs. The unemployed are not so listed for free access to PBS medicines. Returning to the Royal Perth Hospital pharmacy, which I mentioned earlier, the Unemployed Workers Movement in Western Australia estimated that some 50 per cent of the users of this facility-again, the previous speaker wondered who these odd people could be who wanted to use hospitals-were unemployed and, as a result of using it in the form in which it was then offered, were able to gain the free access to medicines which the previous speaker mentioned as being so important to them. State and Federal governments now bear down very heavily on the unemployed and disadvantaged in many areas. Furthermore, so infrequent have been the adjustments in maximum permissible pensioner earnings in relation to eligibility for free access to PBS medicines that vast numbers of the disadvantaged are now effectively excluded.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have argued for the indexing of fringe benefits. The Government's failure to keep up with Whitlam Government standards on this matter means that most pensioners have either lost this aspect of their fringe benefits or are very close to doing so. One woman pensioner who called me on my phone-in, who just falls over the line of ineligibility for the fringe benefits, had just returned home with a $42 pharmacy bill. She could not afford to pay it. Doctors in my area report that other people in the categories I have been discussing have been presenting pharmacies with doctors' prescriptions and requesting them to select from among them the item which is most essential. They cannot afford to pay for the whole lot. The Government must, concurrent with its establishment of a health fees tribunal, give these matters urgent attention. It must also move to implement another of last year's recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee. A recommendation was made for the establishment of a bureau of health economics. I seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard the relevant section of the report of the Public Accounts Committee.

The PAC, throughout its inquiry into the excess payment of pharmacists, was concerned with the general lack of independent objective economic advice on health matters.

        —I thank the House. The Government has not yet given any indication as to whether it will implement the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee. The Committee's final recommendation considered this matter an urgent necessity that should be determined by the Government within one year of the report. That one year period, I would suggest, is very rapidly approaching. The Government has lost sight of the fact, I believe. This is one of the reasons that I am not particularly confident it will implement this scheme. This was indicated in the report of the razor gang, that today expert advice saves money and ensures justice. The Government has been given an opportunity to reverse its normal pattern of behaviour. I believe it must do so. The Bills should be supported. Honourable members on both sides of the House should press the Minister on this matter and the other matters which I have raised to ensure that no injustice results from the implementation of the recommendation. I repeat that I do not believe the pharmacists themselves are obliged to carry social welfare benefits that ought to be charges on the whole community. The Government is obliged, particularly as it is implementing a measure which will, we hope, raise the remuneration to pharmacists, to investigate the areas of disadvantage which are not being picked up, and seriously do something about them.

        —I am very pleased that the House is facing a rare demonstration of unanimity on the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill and the Repatriation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill. The matter is of great importance to every Australian citizen. We all know that the pharmaceutical industry is an essential community service to the people of Australia. It has always been a firm policy of this Government-I think of all governments-since Federation that Australians, wherever they may be, should always have the opportunity to gain access to drugs at a price which they can afford and through the facilities of a private system of pharmacies throughout the land. Regrettably, however, over the years probably one of the few industries which have been to a large degree influenced by the policies of government has been the pharmaceutical industry.

       Last year, as Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I was requested by the Parliament and, through the Parliament, by the Minister for Health to conduct a major review of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, with specific reference to the remuneration of chemists. That arose out of a difficulty found by the Auditor-General in the previous year concerning what were then deemed to be significant overpayments. Unlike my colleague the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges), who demonstrated this afternoon an outstanding capacity not only to represent his electorate but also to represent the pharmacy profession of Australia, I am not a pharmacist. But, as one who in every sense of the word is new to this area, I learnt a tremendous amount about the pharmaceutical industry and the problems of the pharmacy profession from my involvement in that inquiry.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think it is fair to say that the quality of the debate today to a large degree demonstrates the fact that when members of this House have the opportunity to work and to prepare their speeches on the basis of a factual analysis of a specific problem, such as the remuneration of pharmacists, we see in this House an undoubtedly higher standard of debate than we see on other occasions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Speakers for the Opposition in this debate claimed that the Government had been somewhat tardy in this area. I believe that some very unkind remarks were made about my colleague the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar). I place on record the fact that the report which we are considering in relation to these Bills was tabled in this House on 17 September 1980. From my experience, which is not inconsiderable in this area, the response which the Government has managed to demonstrate to date in this most important area is most commendable. This certainly is not to be seen as an isolated area, especially as only yesterday we saw introduced into this House most significant changes in the entire health service program for Australia which no doubt will be in operation for a number of years.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is in that context that we have to commend the Government on its decision to establish a remuneration tribunal. That decision is fully in accordance with the recommendation made by the Public Accounts Committee. We talked in terms of an independent health fees tribunal. At that stage we saw some advantage in bringing medical and pharmaceutical costs under the same controlling apparatus. But, for reasons which I appreciate, that was not possible at this stage. There is no doubt that the decision to establish a remuneration tribunal relating to pharmaceutical benefits in particular should go a long way towards overcoming a deep-felt problem among chemists.
      </para>
      <para>
       Members of the Opposition drew attention to the fact that the Minister had announced previously that the proposed tribunal would be required to make its determination by 1 July this year. I agree that there is a time problem. I accept the point made by my colleague the honourable member for Petrie that a further examination must be made as soon as possible following the establishment of the tribunal but also as to whether the tribunal should bring down an interim settlement if at that stage it is unable to bring down a final determination. On the basis of our investigation last year, I have to say that this subject is so extraordinarily complicated that I think it will take some time before we will be able to have a reasonable arrangement acceptable to the parties in relation to the tribunal.
      </para>
      <para>
       All of us as politicians appreciate only too well that it is not easy to persuade any professional group to accept the determinations of either government or independent bodies. Unfortunately, however, what has happened over the past 20 years in this industry has demonstrated quite clearly that there has been a total breakdown of previous methodology and the approach adopted by successive governments to try to come to a reasonable arrangement with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       In our recommendations last year the Public Accounts Committee made a number of suggestions which, again, the Minister has accepted in this legislation. For example, we drew attention to the fact that under the previous arrangement, of what could be called a tripartite joint committee making the determinations, that committee consisted of a chairman, who was a deputy president of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, supported by two others, one representing the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the second representing the Department of Health. Their investigations and deliberations were conducted completely in camera. In our investigation we found that a most unsatisfactory arrangement. I cast no aspersions on the Pharmacy Guild, but its members were placed in a position in which they were totally dependent upon information coming from the Guild-there was no other source of information whatsoever. In addition, when three people are working in such a situation there is always a risk that ultimately the chairman has no function other than to make a declaration if the other two members have reached agreement. In such a situation it can be found that the Department and the Pharmacy Guild reach a settlement which they regard as satisfactory but which ultimately is not necessarily in the interests of the pharmacy profession, or the community.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the new arrangements submissions will be made in public. All interested parties, including organisations throughout Australia-not the least of which should be the consumer groups-will be given an opportunity to come before the tribunal and to state their points of view. Thus, in a totally open environment the people of Australia, the pharmacists and the Government will be able to see the basis upon which determinations have been reached. An extraordinary revelation during our inquiry was that for many years nobody except the Department of Health was privy to the basis upon which such determinations had been reached. During our inquiry I had the pleasure of opening up the matter to public view, shall we say, with the result that at last people were able to look back to 1967 and to see how the formulas and so forth had been applied. Undoubtedly, access to inspection will represent a major step forward. One aspect of the Bill is, I think, quite significant. Proposed new section 98B (1) states:
      </para>
      <para>
       The function of the Tribunal is to determine the manner in which the Commonwealth price of all or any pharmaceutical benefits is to be ascertained for the purpose of payments to approved pharmaceutical chemists in respect of the supply by them of pharmaceutical benefits.
      </para>
      <para>
       I draw the attention of the House in particular to the word 'manner' and the expression 'which the Commonwealth price of all or any pharmaceutical benefits is to be ascertained'. In our original report we suggested that, because of the very significant complexities in that area and the total failure over 20 years to get both the government and the pharmaceutical bodies to agree on the methodology which should be applied, once again there was perhaps a case for conducting a further review into the mechanics of the industry itself to analyse in depth precisely what its problems are.

       We made that recommendation for one important reason, namely, that we were unable to satisfy ourselves that in this country we had a sufficient depth of accurate information upon which specific determinations could be made. For example, it could be demonstrated that about the top 20 per cent of all pharmacists are doing extremely well, even on the basis of existing statistics. It could be demonstrated also that the lower 20 per cent of pharmacists were doing extremely badly, according to available information. But the case cannot be proved one way or the other. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to expect that those pharmacists, especially at the bottom end of the spectrum, have tended to feel over the years that, in the full sense of the term, they have been given the 'wrong end of the stick'.

      <para>
       It has been pointed out by previous speakers that, whereas in recent years pharmacists have received an increase of approximately 4 per cent, at the same time they have had to absorb a 40 per cent increase in costs. For any industry that would be a matter for concern, especially at a time of a higher inflation than we have tended to experience in Australia during most of this century. It is especially so when the percentage of the community which has access to pharmacies has tended to grow while the trend towards using chemists' prescriptions has tended to fall. The pharmacy profession is most significant. For example, at the present time there are approximately 5,400 pharmacies in Australia, each of which provides a service to approximately 2,650 people. If we compare those figures with those of other countries, such as the United Kingdom or Sweden-as the previous speaker did-we see that, for example, the figures do not necessarily mean all that they say.

       The point has been made, and validly so, that in a large country such as Australia we must ensure that all Australians have access to pharmacological services with the result that even in country towns subsidies have been made available to pharmacists to ensure that that principle is achieved, namely, that all Australians will have access to pharmacological services.

       However, when one examines the basis upon which remuneration has tended to be paid in the past some important points have come through which again I draw to the attention of the House and the Minister because I believe these matters must still be given further consideration. Past attempts to determine the basis for remuneration have tended to have five main characteristics. Firstly, they have been negotiated between two groups only-the Commonwealth Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia-with all other parties being excluded. Secondly, they have been conducted in private without public scrutiny. Thirdly, attempts at determining an objective method of remuneration have been conducted using no independent objective expertise. Fourthly, past surveys have taken a long time to complete and, upon completion, the results generally have been rejected. Finally, after a breakdown in these attempts to determine an objective basis, political negotiations have resulted. In other words, the history of governmental relationships with the Pharmacy Guild and the pharmacy profession, especially over the last 20 years, has left much to be desired. Unfortunately, the complexities in finding adequate bases upon which determinations can be reached are very intricate indeed. For that reason we suggested that it would not be sufficient just to establish a new tribunal but rather a further analyses in depth would have to be conducted to try to get to the facts of the situation facing such an important profession as the pharmacological profession in Australia today.

       I mentioned earlier the question of comparisons. All witnesses appearing before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts agreed that on international comparisons the pharmacy to population ratio in Australia was high and likely to be unnecessarily so, even allowing for the need to provide reasonable pharmacy services, as I mentioned earlier, in isolated and remote areas. However, the point has been made-rightly so-by a previous speaker that whereas the distribution of drugs is essentially a Commonwealth responsibility, the licensing of pharmacists rests with the State governments. This is an area in which I would strongly urge both the professional bodies and the Federal Government to consider discussions with the State Ministers for Health to see whether or not it is possible to come to a more rational basis. On the basis of our investigations last year I am convinced that there is a case of excess pharmacological services in various parts of metropolitan areas of the capital cities and so forth in Australia. However, I am not convinced that a serious attempt has been made by the various levels of government with the professions and with the universities who graduate the pharmacists of tomorrow to see whether it is possible to bring this area under greater control.

       We recommended, for example, that pharmacists consider joint operations where there might be two or three pharmacists in the same village. There would be a good case for them to share the market more equitably and so forth. But there are difficulties in this, not the least of which is the fact that from our investigations pharmacists are probably the ultimate in small business in the full sense of the term. They are proud of their independence; they want to run their own show; they do not particularly wish to be forced into a coalition with other people in the same area and, if they want to do so, of course, there is every opportunity at present. Nevertheless, this is a problem which the Pharmacy Guild is currently considering. It is a problem about which the Government is most concerned. I hope to see in the not too distant future a better structure in that area.

       With the permission of the House I would like to incorporate in Hansard a table demonstrating some of the points I have been making relating to the average costs of dispensing Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescriptions in 1977-78 in the eight strata of pharmacies which were considered by previous investigations. The important point about this table is that it demonstrates, for example, that the average cost per prescription for stratum 1, which incidentally is the pharmacy group which is virtually uneconomic, was 214.8c compared with an overall average of 161c. In stratum 8, which undoubtedly comprises those who for various reasons are most economic, pharmacists were able to process a prescription for 123c compared with the 214.8c I mentioned earlier. Honourable members will be able to see that there is a significant difference in the financial capacity within the industry. I seek leave to incorporate that table in Hansard.

        —I thank the House. I wish to finalise my remarks by referring once again to the substance of the Bill. As I said earlier, I applaud it. It is a step forward. It is fully in accordance with the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee report of last year. I believe it will demonstrate to all the Australian people who are interested in this most important area that there is nothing underhand about the determination of fees. All pharmacists will have access, if they wish, through their organisations or individually to the Tribunal. It will be made up of three persons. The chairman will be a Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, as has been the practice in the past, and one of the other two persons on the tribunal-both selected by the Government-will, of course, have considerable business acumen and background. As I said earlier, this is terribly important in an area which is made up principally of small businessmen who are ultimately the backbone of our society. For example, in my electorate I have no fewer than 70 pharmacists. I have kept a very close relationship with them during the last two years of this inquiry. They have been extremely helpful to me in the preparation of evidence and in briefing me on the realities of their profession. I repeat that, as an outsider who has been brought into contact with this profession, I am sympathetic to the problems that they have and I am equally concerned, as is the Government, to find adequate solutions to their problems.

        —This legislation provides for the setting up of an independent tribunal to determine the remuneration paid to chemists for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. Prior to dealing with the provisions of the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill I would like to outline to the House the history of pharmaceutical benefit schemes. The National Health Service Act 1948, which was introduced by the Chifley Government, had not come into operation before that Government was succeeded by the Menzies Government in December 1949. Partly through regulations under that Act, the Menzies Government introduced a series of measures as part of the national health scheme during the early 1950s. The substance of those regulations was later incorporated in the National Health Act 1953.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The first of the measures introduced was a pharmaceutical benefits scheme under which a restricted range of life saving drugs prescribed by doctors was made available to patients without charge. In July 1951 this scheme was extended to provide a wider range of drugs on the free list for pensioners and their dependants. The benefits provided under the general Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme introduced by the Menzies Government in 1950 were much narrower than those proposed under the legislation of the Chifley Government, being restricted to a list of the most costly life saving and disease preventing drugs. The prices of the drugs included in the formulary resulted from negotiations between the manufacturers and the Department of Health. The reimbursement paid to the pharmacists included a mark-up of 33 1/3 per cent and a dispensing fee. Rising costs and the prospect of that situation continuing led to the introduction of amending legislation in November 1959 which changed the basic concept of the scheme. The general list was widened very substantially to cover practically the same comprehensive range of drugs and medicines as the pensioner list. At the same time a charge of 50c was imposed upon people other than pensioners for drugs and medicines prescribed from the extended general list.
      </para>
      <para>
       Concern about the growing cost of the scheme led to the McMahon Government introducing amending legislation which, in November 1971, raised the patient contribution from 50c to $1 for each prescription. Pensioners and their dependants covered by the pensioner medical service continued to receive pharmaceutical benefits free of charge and special arrangements were made for people enrolled under the subsidised health benefits plan. As part of an attempt to control the growth of public expenditure, the last Budget of the Whitlam Government introduced in August 1975 increased the patient contribution in September from $1 to $1.50 for each prescription for the general public, and from 50c to 75c for beneficiaries under the subsidised health benefits plan. Some six months later, quite early in its term of office, the Fraser Government again increased the patient contribution from 50c to $2 a prescription. As in the past, eligible pensioners were not to be charged for their pharmaceutical benefits. However, the amending legislation removed the pharmaceutical benefits concession for beneficiaries under the subsidised health benefits plan. The Fraser Government raised the patient contribution to $2.50 a prescription as from 1 July 1978. When introducing the legislation the then Minister for Health said that the increase of 25 per cent was broadly in line with the movement in prices and incomes since March 1976 when the last increase took place and therefore was more of an adjustment than a charge.
      </para>
      <para>
       During most of the first two decades in which the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme operated the chemists appear to have been relatively well satisfied with its working. One indication of that was that until 1976-77 the number of pharmacies rose at a faster rate than the population, to a point which constituted a considerable amount of excess dispensing capacity. The numbers continued to incease until 1970-71 when they reached a peak of 5,912.
      </para>
      <para>
       During the second half of the 1960s chemists expressed concern about the adequacy of their remuneration, for the growth of their incomes from mark-ups had been contained because of pressure from the Commonwealth Government on manufacturers' prices. The Pharmacy Guild attempted to exert some political pressure and the Gorton Government granted an increase from 1 July 1970 of 2c in the dispensing fee-the first increase since 1961. After protracted negotiations between the Guild and the McMahon Government fees were increased by 7c from January 1972. The new fees thereby became 39c for ready prepared items and 64c for extemporaneously prepared items. Three separate increases in chemists' fees totalling 23c a prescription were made during 1976-77. In May 1978 Mr Justice Ludeke announced a rise of 9c in dispensing fees with retrospectivity to 1 July 1977. This brought the professional fee to $1.16 for ready prepared items.
      </para>
      <para>
       In his report for 1977-78 the Director-General of Health reported that in other negotiations with the Guild through the joint committee a major breakthrough occurred in May 1978 when the committee agreed to recommend revised rates of remuneration for chemists. This change, which was to apply from 1 August 1978, provided for more of the chemists' remuneration to be paid by way of professional fee and less mark-up. A consequence was that the mark-up for products supplied by chemists under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was to be 25 per cent and the professional fee for ready prepared items $1.30.
      </para>
      <para>
       I turn to the current situation and the effect that price increases have had on Australia's 5,400 retail chemists over recent years. We have seen in recent years a great many chemist shops being transformed into veritable supermarkets, with the traditional chemist wares being pushed into the background and greater attention being given to the sale of confectionary, glassware, kiddies toys, et cetera. In most cases, of course, chemists are being forced to take such action because of two reasons: An oversupply of chemists and a lack of sufficient return on the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. Therefore, two things must happen: There must be a voluntary reduction in the number of chemists' retail outlets by amalgamations and proper remuneration must be paid to chemists for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. This should enable chemists to work towards acting and being seen as members of the health care team and to be relieved of the pressure to compete with supermarkets and other stores.
      </para>
      <para>
       The way in which the present Government has delayed, over recent years, by doing nothing positive to alleviate the situation is nothing short of a disgrace for a government which so often espouses its virtue of being in support of private enterprise. This present legislation will probably be of little assistance to the 25 per cent of chemists already in financial difficulties. Unfortunately, those in the greatest difficulties are the small corner shop chemists who are trying to provide a genuine medical service and who have to compete with the large super sales outlets. Chemists have been hard hit twice by Government decisions to reduce prescription payments. Their only period of tranquillity followed the overpayment of $235m as a result of what the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) described as a computer programming error in 1974.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the past 15 years the share of prescription payments met directly by the public had risen from 25 per cent to 60 per cent. The public now pay $2.75 of the $4.50 average prescription payment. Pharmacists now receive an average of about $4,000 a month in pharmaceutical benefit payments from the Health Department. About one-third of pharmacists' average turnover is made up of national health prescriptions. I mention also that a number of chemists in my electorate are suffering financial constraints and have had to reduce staff because of the Government's delay in reimbursing costs under the Scheme. It is taking up to 12 weeks for reimbursement. I think that is a matter that the Minister might look at with the object of trying to speed up the payments and to reimburse chemists for the amount that they have already paid to wholesalers.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is obvious that the user pays system cannot continue to be applied to matters affecting the health of people. Usually, the greatest cost falls on those least able to pay-the lower middle income earners with large families. Health care, including the supply of medical prescriptions, should be covered by general revenue expenditure, in the same way as social security benefits are, and not on a user pays basis. At present this is affecting many low income earners who just cannot afford the cost involved in having multiple prescriptions filled. They are forced to pick the most necessary item and to leave the rest, thus adversely affecting their recovery from whatever illness they are forced to see their doctor about.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another matter not mentioned by the Minister is the problem facing the Australian pharmaceutical manufacturers because of the lower remuneration paid to them by the Government for the manufacture of products under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Many local manufacturers employing thousands of people will be forced to close if their returns are not increased. This would mean that our medical products would need to come from overseas countries. This is, of course, a further reason why the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme cannot be financed from the patients' prescription payments. It needs to come from general revenue. I can only trust that the proposed Tribunal of three members will do better than the existing Joint Committee of nine members.

        —The National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill gives effect to a decision of the Government to establish an independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to determine the remuneration to chemists for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. In the past the rates of remuneration payable to chemists for the supply of benefits have been determined by the Joint Committee on Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Arrangements. This Committee has comprised four representatives of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and four Government representatives under an independent chairman. The advantages of this independent public Tribunal will be to remove from the political arena the question of the level of fees paid to chemists. Therefore, both the chemists and the Government will be bound by this Tribunal's decisions. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal will also provide a forum in which all interested parties may publicly argue their case while ensuring that the levels of chemists' remunerations are determined by an independent body. Of course, it will remove the need for the Government to finance cumbersome and costly inquiries of the sort-there have been three-that have been conducted since 1964-65.

       It is probably not widely appreciated in the general community that pharmacists are experiencing serious financial difficulties. Over the past 12 months it has become increasingly obvious that chemists who are the most accessible link in our health delivery system have had to rely more and more on their shop front and counter sales to remain in business. Sadly, many pharmacists have not been able to bear this burden and to expand their sales volume. Many closures have been evident. In one city in my electorate the number of businesses has been reduced by half. I quote from a letter from one of those pharmacists:

       The problem is that this industry has to be subject to continual Government control and restriction and often unfair treatment. It has been morally unfair that this one profession in the health care team has been subject to such continual pressures. It is not my intention to delay the passage of these Bills, but I have to raise one further matter in relation to pharmacists and their relationship to Government. I refer to the subject of delayed payments to chemists for pharmaceutical benefits dispensing. In recent weeks I have met almost every pharmacist in my electorate and on many occasions I have had to make representations to the Department of Health in order to speed up payments, some of which have been delayed in excess of three months. Chemists do not belong to a benevolent society. The Commissioner of Taxation gives no leniency to taxpayers, and therefore it is wrong that a government instrumentality should deny payments due to pharmacists or to anyone else longer than a reasonable period. I therefore ask the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar), in replying to the debate on these Bills, to explain the reason for the delay in payments to approved chemists for prescriptions dispensed under the Pensioner Health Service. Why are there increasingly longer periods between claim lodgment and payment? What are the reasons for this delay? Can the Minister also explain what measures his Department is contemplating to reduce these delays to more acceptable periods? I support the Bill.

        That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Extensions to international terminal facilities, Brisbane Airport, Queensland.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since the existing international terminal facilities were completed in 1975 the passenger loading on aircraft has significantly increased to the extent that congestion is now occurring in several critical areas. The Government therefore proposes to enlarge the passenger holding lounges, the check-in areas and the baggage claim areas to alleviate congestion now and in the future. It is intended that these extensions be available in time to handle the increased passenger traffic expected through Brisbane Airport during the Commonwealth Games in September 1982. The works proposed will provide for passenger numbers expected during the Commonwealth Games and at the same time extend the life of the international terminal until approximately 1990. Even if a new international terminal building were to be built, the proposed extensions would still be necessary to cope with the increased passenger traffic which is expected before a new terminal could be completed. The estimated cost of the proposed works at February 1981 is $2.8m. I table plans of the proposed works.

          —Earlier today the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) came into this House and delivered a 44-page speech on why his Government is not fit to conduct the affairs of this country. The decisions that the Prime Minister announced were the end result of what the Government describes as a review of Commonwealth functions. It was nothing of the sort. What the Prime Minister announced to this Parliament today was nothing less than a massive liquidation sale of national assets and public confidence. It was a disgraceful and despicable speech that dishonours the Government's election mandate, condemns the Australian people to even more hardship and distress and utterly destroys the last vestiges of any claim that the Prime Minister may still have had to trust and credibility. There is no national pride, no commitment to the future and no sense of proper standards in any one of the 44 pages of what the Prime Minister had to say. It is the ultimate confession of failure-failure after 5 1/2 years of economic mismanagement and administrative incompetence. For instance, what has happened to all those glowing promises and futile forecasts which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) have been so fond of mouthing every time they get into trouble?
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         In 1975 the Prime Minister promised to switch on the lights. In 1977 he assured Australians that 'our nation is on the move'. A year later, in 1978, he proudly boasted 'the runs are on the board' and Australia 'has made the breakthrough into a period of real prosperity'. Last year, facing another election, the Prime Minister insisted that a 'new spirit and new enthusiasm' had been given to Australia by his Government. Despite all this rhetorical humbug and these outrageous slogans of dishonesty, we arrive at the reality of what this Prime Minister has achieved. It is all there in his speech today, from the 17,000 jobs he promises to destroy, to the state-run agencies he promises to close, to the 40 inquiries he will set up, to the government's programs he will slash and the government enterprises he will sell off to his party's business friends and supporters.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Prime Minister said nothing at all about this wholesale slaughter of national responsibilities during the election campaign six months ago. He refused to take the Australian people into his confidence. He was certainly not given a mandate to carry out this grotesque program which he has now announced to the people. Again, he is guilty of the rank dishonesty that has been so much a part of his Prime Ministership over the last 5 1/2 years. If he believed these decisions were really in the best interests of Australia, why did not the Prime Minister tell the people six months ago? Why did he not have the courage of his convictions and say honestly what he proposed to do if the people re-elected his Government? He did not dare do it and he knows why. He knows that the Australian people would have repudiated this program and would have thrown his Government out of office. So we have more deceit from a Prime Minister well versed in the practice of dishonesty.

          —I withdraw. The reality is that despite all the fine promises made since 1975, the Fraser Government is now opting out of health, education, legal aid, immigration and migrant services, housing, transport and research and development. Profitable state-run activities are being handed over to private corporations, real estate developers and the Government's friends and supporters in big business. The States will have foisted on them the burden of responsibility for functions and services which the Fraser Government has proved itself too incompetent to handle. People will be hurt and jobs will be destroyed. The Prime Minister pretends that in reaching these decisions the Government is being tough and realistic. Yet all the Government is doing is walking out on its responsibilities to the Australian people. This is not small government, it is gutless government. It is exactly the same way that the Prime Minister was too gutless to put these proposals honestly before the people at the election last year. The Government is gutless in deciding to walk away from its proper responsibilities of national administration.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         I said, and I repeat, that this proposal presides over a massive liquidation sale of national assets. It takes another severe swipe at the Public Service. The Australian Capital Territory is brought to a dead halt. Thirty colleges of advanced education are to disappear, while the symbols that the Prime Minister likes to protect for personal pride, the $2m car racing track in Canberra, the Casey University-that protected white elephant-and the College of Advanced Education at Warrnambool, in his own electorate, which was recommended by a Victorian inquiry should be closed, are preserved. It is a huge sellout of national enterprises conferring monopoly rights on the beneficiaries. It is a retreat from effective industry regulation. The Prices Justification Tribunal is gone; the Trade Practices Commission is being hobbled; already its staff has been reduced by 25 per cent. There is, I repeat, no national pride in this Government, no sense of commitment to better goals in this country under its administration and no commitment to a sense of better standards for the people of Australia.
        </para>
        <para>
         It seems to me that the principle boils down to this: If there is profit in it, hand it over to your friends in business; if there is a burden of responsibility, give it to the States. Now it is being proposed that this is all necessary on the pretext of achieving small government as if, innately, small government were a virtue in itself. Firstly the Prime Minister claimed that the Government had been responsible for reducing the size of the public sector in this country. The measure that really counts is the proportion of gross domestic product going to all public authorities in Australia. The reason is simply this: The Government has resorted to rigging the public account books. It has been pushing commitments out of the Budget to the open loan market with public authorities; it has been shifting national responsibilities on to the States. While it might appear that it has contracted some commitments in that sense, the public sector of the Budget has, in fact, increased. Even in the Budget sector the proportion of gross domestic product, on average, in the five years of Fraser Government is higher than on average for the three years of Labor Government. Let me cite the figures for all public authorities. The Fraser Government claims that it has been responsible for reducing the level of government. The average for our three years of government until the end of 1975 was 36 per cent. The average for five years of Fraserism is nearly 39 per cent. Of course, he works on this principle: He writes it and he sees it; he says it and he hears it; therefore it must be real. It is a myth. He believes in fiction.
        </para>
        <para>
         Is the public sector innately bad? Let us get a few facts straight. If a larger public sector is bad for the economy of the country, why is it that Germany does so consistently well? It does much better than this country. Indeed, I seem to recall the Prime Minister is on record that he wished, as a great achievement of his period of administration, he could make the Australian economy as strong and as resilient as that of West Germany. Very few countries have a level of government spending as a proportion of gross domestic product as low as Australia. The mechanical man of the Government whom it winds up every Question Time, the Treasurer is prone to saying that Australia has, by world standards, a low level of total revenue collections. He will go on to another platform and say that government is too big. He cannot seem to understand that if total revenue is low total government is low. That is the fact. The facts are that there are only very few industrialised nations which have a lower proportion of government spending than does Australia and they are relatively backward. I speak of countries such as Turkey and Iceland. We are not far ahead of them. What does the Prime Minister want us to do-reduce our standards to the standards of Turkey with all of its problems? The man has not thought his way through the implications of what he is proposing.
        </para>
        <para>
         Is the public sector all that bad? There are people in this country, literally millions upon millions of them-not just the poor, not just the working class but the middle class-who can never hope to achieve independence and real freedom in this country to experience a decent quality of life unless there is a greater role by government in a range of responsibilities such as health, education, welfare and urban improvement. But not even business can function successfully unless government is there backing it up and supporting it. I talk not just about the obvious regulatory mechanisms necessary for business to function successfully; I am talking also of this so-called mineral development we hear so much of-the boom, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) likes to call it. The Minister is a knight of the realm or, if I may quote Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood, Squire of Llaregyb. If there is to be this sort of mineral development quite clearly there will have to be infrastructural development, there will have to be better ports, there will have to be better coal handling facilities, there will have to be more power stations and there will have to be better communications such as road transportation and rail transportation. A whole range of these things will have to be provided by the government sector. If there is to be a rather rapid growth in the mineral sector there will have to be a larger government sector just to provide for those things.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Minister for Industry and Commerce is no doubt overwrought by the mineral boom. I notice that he was repudiated by the Australian Mining Industry Council in the course of this week. Mind you, this was done very safely well after the election, never before as one would expect from a cipher such as the Mining Industry Council. But again, is the public sector inherently bad? We heard the Prime Minister's rather strange approach to economics. We heard from the Treasurer that qualifications in economics are not a necessary requisite for an adviser to him. That is fairly obvious from the mess they have got the country into. We have heard the strange economics that the Prime Minister is putting up. I am not sure whether it is Thatcherism, Fraserism, fracture or whatever.
        </para>
        <para>
         Suddenly economic recovery is getting under way. Mind you, there are problems because it is not effectively under control. It is happening spontaneously in the sense that a number of ingredients are now at work in the economy to bring this about. What do honourable members think they are? They are increased government employment, especially at the national level; increased government expenditure resulting from the last Budget; increased real expenditure by 3 per cent; increased wage settlements which the Government opposed and which allow people to go out in the market place and buy more goods and services, get production going and get the economy under way; a building boom on the east coast which may well be squashed out with the credit squeeze that is coming in now; and increased money supply. These are all of the ingredients, unintentional on the part of the Government, that go to make up post-Keynesianism. Can we imagine it-the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, being a closet post-Keynesian? It is a little like Leonid Brezhnev carrying an American Express credit card whenever he goes overseas.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government says that it is necessary to do the things it has outlined today because it wants to transfer commercial functions to the private sector, where the consumer is in control-where there is consumer sovereignty-and the market forces will have free play. That situation has never been believable in Australia. Australia, because of its size in geographic terms and the smallness of its population which is spread sparsely over that area, has been a country where in productive terms there has been a high level of monopoly and oligopoly and all of the abuses that go with that. In those circumstances it is sheer nonsense to talk about market forces working in this country. Does anyone believe that the rural socialists would subscribe to market forces working anyway?
        </para>
        <para>
         I will tell the House what the Prime Minister is doing. He is not trying to oil up the market forces at all; he is conferring monopoly rights on the beneficiaries who will move in and buy up some of the State enterprises which he wants to sell out, which are operating well and which are highly profitable. He is going to neglect social aspects of some of these enterprises. He is going to surrender essential regulatory authority over standards. Many of the things he proposes are just straight out gifts to the people who will buy into them.
        </para>
        <para>
         There is no doubt about it; a small investment in the election funds of the Liberal and National Country parties gives one a handsome return these days. We will never get the Liberal and National Country parties subscribing to public disclosure of the sources of funds to their parties. They have been bankrolled, they have been bought out and they have been totally corrupted, especially by the mining companies in this country. I will give the House some illustrations of what I mean. I refer to the sell-out of airline terminals. The airline terminals operate profitably. Surely this businessman's government can continue to operate them profitably. Why hand over those profits to the private sector? Why not keep them in the public sector? Handing them over means that the Government will get no more than about 43 per cent at the most as a return in corporate tax. So the Government will get much less. It will have to make up the shortfall with additional revenue somewhere else, have a deficit or cut into public spending. It is just nonsense. Again, selling out airline terminals will confer monopoly rights on the purchasers. We all know of the sorts of rewards which are available from the concessions which are leased in airline terminals-the cafeterias and the various speciality shops that operate there. Airline terminals ought to be a public instrumentality so they can be controlled in the public interest by the public representatives.

         The Australian Government Publishing Service bookshops are about to be handed over to the private sector. The consequence is obvious. There are many publications which are produced from government sources in relation to the official workings of government-inquiries and so on and things associated with this Parliament. These are publications of vital importance to people of specialised interest in the community. It is essential that those people should have easy access to those publications. I go beyond that. If necessary these bookshops should be generously subsidised so that we can disseminate information about how the system of government and how the democratic processes are functioning. The private sector will not be carrying these sorts of publications about which I am talking. The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation is to go to the private sector. It has been outstandingly successful, applauded by a vast range of private enterprise groups in the home building industry. For instance, in March this year the Housing Industry Association said:
        </para>
        <para>
         We would submit that now is not the time to sell HLIC because: in the absence of Government regulation HLIC by its dominant position in the market place (60% of business) sets prudential standards of management it could lead to a serious reduction in the availability of low deposit loans, particularly in remote areas HLIC has been instrumental in assisting the development of innovative home ownership lending schemes it would risk major disruption to the housing finance market during a period when claims of all mortgage insurers have been increasing significantly it would close off the possibility of having HLIC develop an Australia-wide secondary mortgage market HLIC could play a vital role in enabling funds to move from surplus areas to capital deficient regions.

         If the Government wanted to be creative in the way in which it provided funds for home builders and insurance support for mortgagors and mortgagees and in the way in which it regulated the flow of liquidity at various times in the economy, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation would be an excellent mechanism for it to take up. I give a firm undertaking that the Labor Government, after 1983, will re-establish it as a public instrumentality. The profitable courier services are being handed over because they are successful as competitors with the private sector. The acoustic services will also be handed over. Only certain stipulated people are able to use the acoustic services of the Federal Health Department. They are largely, but not exclusively, people of moderate means. They will now be forced to go to private sources where, quite frankly, they will be ripped off because the hearing aid industry is one of the big rip-offs in this country.

          —I know that unemployment is not of much concern to the honourable member who is giggling. I do not know whether he is giggling because another honourable member has joined him. One of his predecessors who is no longer in the Parliament, the former member for Canberra, said that the unemployment benefit should not be provided for the young unemployed. The implication was that they should be starved back to work or into death and out of the way. That is why the present honourable member for Canberra is with us. The capital works program has been brought to a halt. The Canberra convention centre, the Museum of Australia, the National Library extensions, the Federal Police Headquarters, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Headquarters and the National Biological Standards Laboratory have been deferred. This means, very simply, that the recovery which was mildly getting under way in Canberra after an extended and deep recession is about to be aborted by government action. Given more than that, the Government's decision is a reflection of a lack of national pride. Many of Canberra's buildings serve a national purpose in inspiring people to visit this city. The Convention centre, the Museum of Australia and the National Library extensions would have been in the same category. To his credit, the late Sir Robert Menzies was very proud of this city. More than anyone else, largely because of the time he had available to him as Prime Minister, he made a very determined effort to develop Canberra and make it a city of which all Australians could be proud and with which visitors from overseas would be enormously impressed. That has all gone by the board.

         The Public Service has been made a scapegoat. I pointed out that 17,000 public servants are to lose their jobs as a result of the decisions announced today. Let us use the employment multiplier. We could use the Viner employment multiplier, which is about 10, depending on the temperature of the day but we will use a more realistic one of three. Seventeen thousand multiplied by three means that well over 50,000 will be unemployed with multiplying effects. The total effect is that close to 1 per cent of the workforce will become unemployed because of the Government's decisions tonight. This review is a policy for more unemployment. The consequences are contrary to what the Prime Minister has said. Standards will slide. Let me quote from the March 1981 report of the Auditor-General. A number of statements in that report ought to be put on the record because they effectively rebut the claim of the Prime Minister that we can give the Public Service more work and fewer people and it will be more efficient. In relation to the Administrative Services Department the Auditor-General's report stated:
        </para>
        <para>
         It is a matter for concern that, at the time of the audit, claims examinations were significantly in arrears, the backlog being estimated at approximately 10 man-years . . . the arrears in the Financial Services Section have resulted from staff shortages in that area:
        </para>
        <para>
         In relation to the Department of Finance the report stated:
        </para>
        <para>
         Seventy-four expenditure statements and audit certificates received pursuant to development programs and projects had not been examined at the time of audit . . . Approximately 80% of these statements had been held by the Department for longer than 6 months . . . The number of unexamined statements has resulted from staff shortages over the last 18 months.
        </para>
        <para>
         In relation to the Health Department the report stated:

         I ask honourable members to listen to the following statement:

        </para>

         We are talking about very large sums of money amounting to many millions of dollars. The report continued:
        </para>
        <para>
         The Department recently advised arrangements had now been made to obtain information from the Department of Social Security to provide sufficient details to validate these numbers but because of priority commitments on that Department's staff resources the information may not be available until at least mid-1981.
        </para>
        <para>
         On the Department of Home Affairs and Environment the report stated:
        </para>
        <para>
         Measures taken to reduce the backlog in clearing 'open-period' records include setting priorities for records to be examined; undertaking appraisal, rather than detailed examination, where this can be done safely; and recruiting additional staff when ceilings and other priorities permit.
        </para>
        <para>
         What a forlorn hope. What that nails is the lie of the claim of those on the Government side who say that fewer Public Service staff members can turn out more work. I repeat that with the sorts of demands building up through mineral development and a range of other undertakings in the community there will be a need for more, not fewer, members of staff in the Public Service. Let us look at how the Government's policy on staff ceilings in the Public Service affects people. I refer to a letter to Sir William Cole, the Chairman of the Public Service Board, in November last year from the office of the Secretary to the Department of Transport. I shall not quote the whole letter. It states:
        </para>
        <para>
         I am concerned that the Department will be unable to undertake the Government's directives on these matters--
        </para>
        <para>
         the letter refers to the new domestic aircraft-
        </para>
        <para>
         if the additional staff are not forthcoming, and the Government should be advised accordingly . . . you indicated that the Prime Minister had asked why the various programs and activities of this Department could not continue to be performed within the end-September staffing figure by redeploying staff from lower priority areas or by dropping or winding down existing functions.
        </para>
        <para>
         You will be aware that the bulk of the Department's staff is employed in ensurig the safe and efficient operation and maintenance of Australia's air services and to a lesser extent in the support and safety aspects of shipping services. It is not possible to reduce the staff levels at present involved in these facets of the Department's work; on the contrary it is essential that numbers are increased to cater for the growth and new developments in transport activity.
        </para>
        <para>
         The letter indicates many of the more serious problems which will arise. It states that the consequences from staff shortages will be, amongst other things, 'degradation in policy advice areas'. The letter continues:
        </para>
        <para>
         I should also point out that any wind-down in services provided in the air and marine operations areas would have implications for the cost recovery program. This would almost certainly lead to industry complaints of service reductions and probable calls for reduced fees and charges.
        </para>
        <para>
         The most alarming aspect is that air safety is being imperilled because of staff reductions. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) has pointed out on many occasions how navigational aids go out of operation and remain out of operation for extended periods because of staff cutbacks. All the Government is doing is destroying the pride of a decent part of the Australian work force and the career service they chose. They will suffer a loss of esteem because they are constantly being imputed as parasites by this Government when in fact their contribution is an extraordinarily important and productive one for our society.
        </para>
        <para>
         There was an interesting but nonetheless highly relevant diversion in this Parliament last year when we debated the decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission concerning Determination No. 503. I need spell out no more than that. Determination No. 503 relates to the Commonwealth Employment (Redeployment and Retirement) Act. The Public Service successfully fought the Government's efforts to apply an interpretation on that associated matter in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. One of the aspects of it was that if work was going outside the Public Service on contract there should be no retrenchments. The decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was, inter alia, this: Before any stand downs could take place the following had to happen:
        </para>
        <para>
         (6) Discussions shall take place on measures to avoid the need for the declaration of officers or employees including, where appropriate:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         (d) reviewing the extent of outside contracting work carried on for a Department;
        </para>
        <para>
         What is the significance of that? It is simply that what the Government has proposed could not have been proposed unless the Government had steamed through the Parliament last year its disallowance of Determination No. 503 in a most despicable and unprincipled way. Some 17,000 public servants can now be retired, redeployed or whatever as a consequence of that action. I put it to the Government that this is unnecessarily provocative and undoubtedly will lead to industrial disruption of an undesirable dimension.
        </para>
        <para>
         There are some interesting facets, however, about Public Service cuts. The cuts have been quite severe. They have been applied for a few years. We have been told that they have been applied across the board. Yet if one reads the relevant statistical sources one discovers that the Department of the Treasury, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Public Service Board have been able to increase their staff at a time when the number of jobs available in the Public Service will be reduced by 10,000. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has increased its staff by 17 per cent, Treasury by 10 per cent, and the Public Service Board by 5 per cent to preside over a reduced staffing level in the Public Service. So we have the Treasury, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Public Service Board as a sort of land of lotus eaters in the Public Service.
        </para>
        <para>
         Other departments are not so fortunate. They are the key departments. I refer to the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Office. I notice that in the later statement of the Prime Minister, Treasury and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet escape unscathed again. The Department of Primary Industry, of course, has to bear some of the burden. It will lose, but lose only, the Plague Locust Commission. Such is the power of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony).
        </para>
        <para>
         I turn now to education. Some 30 colleges of advanced education are to disappear as entities. They will disappear completely. At the same time, the Prime Minister will preserve the College of Advanced Education at Warrnambool, despite the fact that the Partridge report in Victoria recommended that it should close. In the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Country Party-we all know after the disclosures of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) how powerful the National Country Party is-the Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education will be kept open. It has an enrolment of no more than about 100 students-a level much lower than 22 of the 30 colleges which are to be closed. The Prime Minister is determined that the Casey University-the Australian Defence Force Academy will survive. A white elephant that will cost $70m is to play up to the Prime Minister's sense of personal conceit. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has rejected it. In its report it stated:
        </para>
        <para>
         There is no clear evidence that the training of cadets of all Services in a common establishment would of itself provide any improvement of the quality of officers.
        </para>
        <para>
         It pointed out how existing institutions, at a time when there are clearly too many tertiary institutions, can do this job satisfactorily. The Prime Minister is determined to have one monument to his everlasting glory. After all, he had to accept that the electrification of the railway line between Sydney and Melbourne would be cancelled. What was dearest to his heart could not be achieved-that he would go down in history as the man who had the trains running on time.
        </para>
        <para>
         We have the first instalment of fees being introduced at tertiary institutions. The principle of free tertiary education has now been breached. This will be to the disadvantage of the less well-off in the community. I do not mean the poor; I mean the middle class, the people of modest income. They will have as much trouble as any other group. In education there will be a contraction of the functions of the Schools Commission and a handover of those functions to the States, with all the unevenness of response that will result. In some cases the response will be alacrity and in others indifference to the needs of the most important resource we have in this community-our young children.
        </para>
        <para>
         I want to make it clear that the Opposition's approach to education is vastly different from that of the Government. It is not just a matter of producing inputs for industry; it is a matter of developing rounded minds of creative, questioning intellects, of having people who can contribute broadly in the community, not just in the work force but in their recreational associations and in their creative interests; people who can question the system under which we live and ask questions about how it can be improved. All the Government wants is docile hands to pull the plungers and the levers in the work force. What will happen with the restrictions is that the efforts of the Schools Commission to try to bring about equality of resources nationally within the education system will not be achieved. Can honourable members imagine a backwoods man like Sir Charles Court or Mr Bjelke-Petersen being committed to high standards or better quality in our educational system? Mr Bjelke-Petersen is a very rich man and he thinks everyone would be if they had the same acumen as he has. After all, he went into the State Parliament a man of modest means and he became rich in a very short time. The Curriculum Development Centre will go, so the effort to get some sort of uniformity in curriculums is not on.

          —I must say the Squire of Llaregyb has turned up. Public school education always gives one a sort of Latin finish, does it not? I will stick with 'curriculums'; it sounds good Anglo-Saxonism to me. Restrictions on government school building funds will have a severe effect on the quality of the buildings available for education for our children and in which our teachers have to work. They are entitled to decent industrial conditions. Since 1975 there has been a 35 per cent reduction in those funds in real terms; that is, $134m as against $4m for the private schools in real terms. Nearly all of that has been in the catholic parochial schools. The tertiary education assistance allowance is not to be increased. It is now $8 a week less in real terms than it was five years ago. The Government proposes to introduce prime and tougher means testing conditions so that fewer people will draw the benefits.

         The Prices Justification Tribunal is to be abolished. The Government surrenders effective regulatory mechanisms in terms of the pricing system of this country. It does so at a time when clearly inflation is breaking out again from an already too high level. The justification of the Government is that the PJT has outlived its usefulness and it has made no significant impact on inflation. The only reason for that is that it has been choked to death by a series of decisions of the Government. Every year in the annual report of the Tribunal we see evidence of the savings to this community in price increases forgone because of its surveillance and in price reductions. In 1973-74 when the PJT started off-it started off with support and, therefore, with confidence and conviction that it could do a job-it said this:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . the 12.2 per cent of price notices which were reduced after public inquiries or negotiations amounted to a total saving, on an annual basis of about $253m.
        </para>
        <para>
         Do not tell me it cannot do an effective job. A more recent report issued in 1978 stated:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . 2244 notices of proposed higher prices; 455 of these notices were either withdrawn or resulted in lower-than-proposed price increases following examination by the Tribunal; . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         It can work, if it is given support. We need that sort of regulatory mechanism in an economy like ours which is so highly concentrated. One need only look at the statistics. The largest one per cent of manufacturing firms in this country employ 30 per cent of the work force; the largest four per cent employ over 50 per cent of the work force. That is evidence of concentration-clear evidence, on the face of it, of the high level of monopoly and oligopoly. Look at income levels. The top six per cent of companies earn 80 per cent of the taxable income. Clearly, on the face of that sort of evidence, we have a very highly monopolised and oligopolised economy. Therefore, we need mechanisms to regulate them to protect the consumers. Market forces and consumer sovereignty are just sheer fantasy. There has to be government intervention to protect the people.
        </para>
        <para>
         We now face a situation in which there is a fresh outbreak of inflation. Unemployment is climbing and interest rates are up and will go higher. It will be a long time before they come down. The sort of reaction we expect from the Government will result in an aborting of the economic recovery which is now beginning to show. One of the essential ingredients to economic management in the forthcoming period is some good old fashioned but thoroughly workable post-Keynesian economic principles, plus a prices-incomes policy. If we do not have an effective prices-incomes policy we can write off the whole exercise. We cannot expect to have an effective prices-incomes policy when the trade union movement and the professional associations stand back and see that they will be subjected to the surveillance of the Industrial Relations Bureau, a gilded drone that cost $12m and has produced nothing. There has been a 70 per cent increase in its work force while the work force of other departments has been reduced. The trade union movement will stand back and see that it is subjected to that surveillance but that business is no longer subjected to a proper price overview-and we will not get an effective prices-incomes policy. It is as simple as that. This is the government that believes in equality in the sharing of the burden of sacrifice. That is why the Olympic athletes were not allowed to go to Moscow but the wool and the wheat were!

         We see the same thing in relation to business. Tough measures have been taken against the people. Many welfare benefits have disappeared and there has been a reduction in Aboriginal welfare spending all at a time of serious ill-health amongst Aborigines. There are health, housing and employment problems as well as the general needs of the urban community. Poverty in Australia, one of the wealthiest nations in the world, has doubled to include nearly two million people in five years of Fraserism. Look at all the sacrifices hurled in that direction. One would expect some equality, some tough measures in relation to business.

         If one listened to the way the Prime Minister presented the situation in his account today, as distinct from looking at the implications in the appendices attached to his speech which were circulated later, one would have thought it was fairly fierce stuff. However, the appendices show the Government is striking business with a velvet glove. The investment allowance will be reduced from 20 per cent to 18 per cent-a tiny change. The depreciation loading will go down from 20 per cent to 18 per cent-again a tiny change. However, I confess that it is significant for its symbolism because the level to be changed was introduced in the last Budget, only a few months ago, and already it has been hacked back, like so many promises. The capital expenditure write-off for mineral and oil field development has been reduced from six years to five years, and the petroleum shareholding rebate is to go down from 30 per cent to 27 per cent. The full write-off conversion from oil-fired plant is now to be calculated over two years instead of one year. They are tough measures.
        </para>
        <para>
         Is government treated toughly? We hear that we need more independence, enterprise, resourcefulness and initiative in this country because that is the sort of thing on which private enterprise is based. The report of the Myers Inquiry into Unemployment Benefit Policy and Administration shows that tax concessions for business in 1979-80 cost taxpayers $3,500m. Budget allocations to business this year totalled $825m. There is no doubt about it, if one is resourceful and has initiative, one can get a lot of help. The protection transfer from consumers to producers will cost about $5,500m this year. So we are talking about support, directly and indirectly, for business in this country of the order of more than $10,000m this year, or $1 in every $7 that consumers spend. That is the sort of burden they have to bear to keep private enterprise going. I resent the talk about the bludgers on social welfare handouts when I see that sort of thing. I do not condemn it in all regards; in many respects it is important. But, it does evidence the preferential way in which this Government goes about distributing the burden of sacrifice.
        </para>
        <para>
         I want to mention a few small things, including the contracting out proposal and construction design work. The arrangements, resources and staff are already there but hiring them out to the private sector will lead to increased, pumped up prices. Legal and accounting work will go out to the private sector. It has been shown by the report of the poverty inquiry of a few years ago, which dealt also with legal matters, and more recently by the Law Reform Commission, that work done by lawyers in the private sector is two to three times dearer than work done in the public sector. How the hell does the Government think it will save money there? It is quite obvious that there is a bit of pork-barrelling going on here. Government printing will go out to the private sector, although we have a printery already which is capable of meeting our needs.
        </para>
        <para>
         Research and development for departments such as the Department of Defence will go out to the private sector, in some cases to universities. But they will not get any extra money. How will they do it? I ask myself how much of this will stay in Australia anyway. The export expansion grants are to be reduced at a time when export volumes are down 12 per cent, when the Australian dollar is revaluing and therefore disadvantaging the competitiveness of Australian industry and when there is a depressed world economic market. I accept the views of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) when he points out that there are better ways to promote trade than to do this, but the Government is not proposing to seek better ways. It proposes just to save money at a time when exports are going down, when the current account is in a very sick condition and internationally there are not very encouraging prospects.

         There will be a review of the functions of Telecom Australia to see whether they can be more efficiently performed by private enterprise. This is interesting because the Government already has the McKinsey report on Telecom, the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) has announced the King inquiry and the Prime Minister, to maintain his standard as outlined by the honourable member for Kooyong this week, has announced a third inquiry running over the top of the rest. I do not think the members of the Ministry ever talk to each other. When one looks at and hears them, one does not blame them. Where does the Deputy Prime Minister stand in relation to the proposal that Telecom ought to be dismembered, with the profitable parts going out to the private sector? I ask the Deputy Prime Minister that because the cost of uneconomic services provided by Telecom, very largely to the rural area, is $230m. So there is a hidden cross-subsidy taking place within the overall operations of Telecom. These rural socialists might not impress us as being very bright, but they know how to get the redistributional process going. Will they stand by while that happens? If this takes place and if the loss-making areas are left with the public instrumentality, where will the Government get the money?

         We heard about health last night. There has been a shuffle on the balance sheets, and we will all end up paying more. A total of 80 per cent of medical treatment is doctor-initiated, according to the report of the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals. The proposals the House had put before it last night will provoke over-utilisation by doctors and encourage over-resort to medical treatment by the public. The Government is promoting a headlong rush into the American type of health mess. Like the Bourbons, this Government knows nothing and it learns nothing, because these are the very ingredients of the debate which took place in this country in the 1960s and early 1970s leading up to the establishment of Medibank.

         There have been remarkable reforms in the employment area. The Government is to change the statistical system again. It has changed it already on a number of occasions. It had seasonally adjusted unemployment statistics but found them embarrassing because they were higher than the Government wanted. So, how did it reform them? They were eliminated. I imagine that was a good Stalinist measure. It then had statistics for wage and salary earners in employment. The Government wiped them out in April 1980 because they showed a lower level in the civilian work force than the figure it preferred. That comes from the labour force survey, which is still published. Mind you, if honourable members do not mind my getting into a catch-22 situation, the statistics for both wage and salary earners in employment, which are not published any more, and the labour force series are collected and collated. The labour force series statistics, according to the Australian Statistician, are unreliable. The reliable ones, therefore were gotten rid of. The Government now intends to get rid of the Commonwealth Employment Service statistics because they are embarrassing. They show a higher level of unemployment than the Government is prepared to acknowledge. The Government did not acknowledge that if these cuts go across the board there will be something like a 10 per cent cut in the work force in the Commonwealth Employment Service. Let us hear that spelt out.

         I now refer to Aboriginal affairs. What sort of commitment of conscience do Liberals have for our black Australians? Housing is a grim area of deprivation. Housing funds will be sent across to the States and general housing allocations will be made. We know what will happen in the two most racist States of the Commonwealth-Queensland and Western Australia. The housing needs of the Aboriginals will be absorbed, neglected and they will disappear. The Sacred Rights Protection Authority in the Northern Territory will be handed across to the Northern Territory Government. That Government is in the pocket of the mining companies. We know how much will be sacred there.

         I turn to the Industrial Relations Bureau, the gilded drone which I referred to earlier. Well, Andrew Peacock goes and the IRB stays! It is as simple as that. The Prime Minister has made it hallowed ground. The IRB cost $12m and it has had a 77 per cent increase in its work force. I said before that the increase was 70 per cent, but it was 77 per cent. Other departments of more importance, which were at least productive, have had their staff cut back. The translating and interpreting services of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will be disposed of. That will create inefficiencies in departments which require highly sensitive matters to be interpreted, such as the Department of Defence. It will mean higher costs for government. It will mean less satisfactory work because the evidence is that outside translation services have not been as good. It will mean delays and added costs for migrants seeking work in relation to qualifications, birth certificates and other necessary certificates. The cut backs in the Telephone Interpreter Service are further evidence of the disregard of this Government for the migrants of the community.

         The Government has stopped nowhere. It has even got into the petty cash box. It intends to sell out the numismatic coin marketing area to the private sector. That function was particularly profitable. The recent issue of the $200 gold coin was fetching a premium of $310. Why pass that over to the private sector? The responsibility for the safeguards of uranium is to be passed to the States. That is like giving a blowtorch to a pyromaniac for a plaything. The Opposition will totally oppose that. It is my considered opinion, on the advice I have been given, that this is most likely in contravention of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the agreement which Australia has with the International Atomic Energy Agency for the application of safeguards in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
        </para>
        <para>
         Having said all that, what has been achieved by the Government is a saving of $560m. The Government is particularly coy at not giving details as to how this saving is calculated. What are the constituent parts and how were they arrived at? We are always hearing: 'How much will it cost the Australian Labor Party? Where will it get the money from?' I would ask the Treasurer the same question. He nods his head. That is all he can do because he has not been wound up enough yet. The Government says it will save $560m in a full year. Do honourable members know what that is? At the most it is 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product. In 1980-81 public authorities spending was 38.8 per cent-nearly 39 per cent-of gross domestic product as against an average of about 36 per cent for all public authorities betwen 1972 and 1975. That will bring the spending down to 38.4 per cent at the most. That will hardly put a dint in it. What is the Prime Minister about? It has nothing to do with smaller government. The evidence shows that he believes in big government for his big and powerful friends in the corporate sector. He makes it tough for ordinary people. This is just a sell-out. It is a camouflage for the sell-out to the friends who have been supporting him. There is much straining for so little saving, but it has nasty effects where it is directed.
        </para>
        <para>
         Let me make some further observations. Last September the Prime Minister told us in his usual pedestrian fashion why we should be optimistic about the future. He claimed that his Government was responsible for 'a new spirit, a new enthusiasm, a new dynamism at work in Australia'. Well, it was not the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is over there. The Prime Minister went on:
        </para>
        <para>
         We are entitled to be confident of our capacity to march through the decade ahead at a pace better than almost any other nation.
        </para>
        <para>
         Of course, an election campaign was just beginning then. Today, after weeks of straining by the Lynch committee, the Prime Minister has given us a different view altogether. It is the view of a narrow-minded and miserable government, contemptuous of the people and sympathetic only to its friends. The Prime Minister congratulated the Lynch committee for the work that it had done. In the view of the Opposition, and the great majority of the Australian people, in only one sense does the committee deserve congratulations. It has demonstrated beyond the call of duty how blind, mean-spirited and gutless this Government really is. Ten years ago a former Liberal Prime Minister was forced to scrabble through his filing cabinet for help when he was asked for his vision of Australia. The prospect shown to us today is no more encouraging and no less humiliating.
        </para>
        <para>
         We had an hour of words from the Prime Minister adding up to no more than a sell-out list of cut price specials and ignominious retreat from responsibility. The Government has shown by this program that it wants us to relapse into a series of separate provinces, each with its own place, its own parochial interests, and its own priorities. This comes at a time of economic and other social challenges which demand rational action and national initiative. The Government wants to strip from the people the services that support them at a time of economic strain that demands they be treated with compassion and sensitivity. Only recently we have learned to prepare for the great and rapid changes taking place in the skills that our children need, the way they will work, and the way they will spend their leisure time. Yet this Government demands that the investment needed to prepare for these changes be reduced and, in places, abolished.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is absolutely imperitive that we understand and prepare for the great transitions ahead in science and technology and their impact on all our lives. Yet the Government has dismembered the Department of Science and Technology and what was left last year of the Department of Productivity. There is much more on this list of mean and petty decisions which, in conjunction with the proposed new arrangements for health care, bespeak mean and petty minds. They are not Friedmanites on the Government benches; they are Luddites. The program put before us today by the Prime Minister, if not quickly arrested, will put this nation back years. The next Labor Government will, therefore, have as its first priority after the 1983 election the task of restoring the community from the inevitable effects of these decisions. In the knowledge that the States alone cannot mount and sustain national programs for better education, health services, transport and the like, we will restore the national Government's proper role in developing and co-ordinating initiatives in these areas with the States. We fully acknowledge that there is a proper place and role for efficient and profitable state-run enterprises. After 1983 we will restore to the care of the people those concerns which this Government intends to sell off to private interests and which we deem essential to be maintained in the public sector.
        </para>
        <para>
         In the realisation that the nation must be ready for the profound change which is on the way we will reinvest the people's energy and resources in scientific and technological research and development. Above all, we will work to restore our sense of national identity and pride, which will be so battered by the regressive proposals put to the House today. The Australian people have an intense feeling for their country-a vigorous sense of pride in what has been achieved and what is possible to achieve after 80 years as one nation. We have attracted and we still attract new settlers from every other continent. We speak in international forums as a sane and influential community. We rejoice in the economic and social potential of our country. The conservative and myopic outlook shown by this program is absolutely at odds, altogether out of step, with this national pride and promise. That is why we on this side of the House totally oppose the program drawn up by the Government and why we deplore the miserable attitude responsible for it.

          —Every time I hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) speak I am encouraged by the prospects of the next general election. It is not really a matter for me tonight to appear to have any perception of meanness. No doubt there is not a great number of people listening to this debate at this hour and the galleries are not as filled as they were during the earlier part of this debate. But can I share a confidence with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and those honourable members who are in the House? Why is it that the Leader of the Opposition can come into this House again this week with such a pathetic presentation? I am not sure that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) entirely shares the concern of some honourable members opposite. When I sit in this House in a casual and quietly relaxed frame of mind and watch the Leader of the Opposition, who obviously is very nervous and very uptight, assume the ferret-type character that has become a part of him in recent years, I ask myself for how long the front and back benchers of the Australian Labor Party will remain with the Leader of the Opposition. Again in a very relaxed frame of mind tonight I heard the Leader of the Opposition declare that this review of the Commonwealth functions shows gutless government. When I first heard that phrase I thought to myself how monumentally inappropriate it was for the honourable gentleman to use that phrase in this House. As I recall-the honourable member for Wills may or may not wish to recall it-Geoff Duncan, reporting on the program PM on 18 July 1979 said:

         I recall also the Australian Associated Press report of 19 July 1979-I dignify the honourable member for Wills's apparent statement of that type-which is stated:

          —Let us concentrate on the fundamental issues which are the subject of dialogue tonight. In fact what the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has exposed in the House in the course of this day is really the fundamental dichotomy, the difference, the void, which exists between the philosophies, the practices and policies of the Opposition and the Government. I welcome opportunity to involve myself directly in this debate. In 1975 and at every election since 1975 the Australian people have indicated a total reluctance and opposition to accepting the Labor Party alternative to the philosophies and the policies which have been so inimitably outlined and evidenced by the Prime Minister in the course of this debate today. The Review of Commonwealth functions, contrary to what the Leader of the Opposition has asserted in this debate, has in fact sought to achieve and, I believe, has achieved the restoration of national assets to the Australian people.

          —Mr Deputy Speaker, the honourable gentleman and his colleagues can mount, as the Australian people are very much aware, a case for regulation, for big government, for more diversified and additional government resources and a larger private sector and all the taxation imposts and burdens that go with that proposition. I accept that that case can be mounted. That is a proposition that the Liberal and National Country parties reject without qualification.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         The Leader of the Opposition referred to national resources. Under the policies and philosophy of this Government no more will these assets and resources be absorbed by the insatiable demands of that form of faceless bureaucracy which characterised the Labor Party's Administration from 1972 to 1975. The Leader of the Opposition, as a member of the Labor Administration of that time, as the gallery of this House would be very much aware, witnessed and condoned a massive increase in the size of the public sector, the unfettered spread of regulation throughout all the sectors and the dimensions of Australian industry and, at the same time, the destruction of business and community confidence. While the honourable gentleman remains in his present chair he will be a constant reminder of those years because he is a regulator and he is the man of big business. He is the high taxation man and the preserver of resources in the public sector. Those honourable members who sit behind him at present, as unhappily the honourable member for Wills does, must of course be prepared to be counted in that form of dialogue.
        </para>
        <para>
         Honourable members of this side of the House welcome the debate. We very much appreciate what the Prime Minister has brought down. If this debate proves anything, if it puts anything on the table of this Parliament tonight it is that fundamental dilemma between the policies which the Opposition has practised before and which have been found wanting. It is that dilemma between the centralisation of power or the devolution of authority. It is the choice between a large or a small government. It is a choice between a larger bureaucracy or a centralisation of power and the opportunities of private citizens to grow and to be self-reliant and strong. This Government rejects any suggestion of big government or higher taxation or the tyranny of those regulations which characterised the Labor Party in past years. I believe the alternatives in this debate are very clear. We reject utterly and categorically that philosophy proposed by the Leader of the Opposition tonight. The Australian Labor Party has always been a paternalistic party. Its attitude is bureaucratic and it is sadly out of touch with the social moves and the sense of reality which characterise the Australian community at present.
        </para>
        <para>
         This Government is determined to seek taxation reduction, to seek a continuing attack on the war against inflation, to put scarce resources where they are the most needed and to seek the raising of real wages. This can be done only by the reduction of public sector spending and not by the soft options which the Leader of the Opposition has sought to propose in this debate. Let me say that this Government, representing the Liberal and National Country parties, is determined to ensure by the review statement made by the Prime Minister this afternoon that bureaucratic government duplication and waste is eliminated and that the taxpayer gets maximum value for his tax dollar. This is a government with a consistent philosophy, policy and practice that is committed to achieving small, efficient government to allow private enterprise freedom to grow and develop, to take the initiative in Australia's economic future and to allow individual Australians the right to determine what they do with their earnings.
        </para>
        <para>
         I believe the area of big government-certainly this is so if one thinks back to 1972-75-has been seen and found wanting. Now new directions are required in Australia. They have been taken by the coalition parties of this Government. No other government has been more consistent in moving away from the juggernaut of the Whitlam years towards a government that seeks to place emphasis first upon the recognition of the individual. The report handed down by the Prime Minister surely is a major step in that direction. It is the first step in the continuing operation of the Committee of Review and, with the full support of the members of the Liberal and Country parties, that step taken today will be seen to be massive in what it can do for Australia during the years and the decades ahead.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is patently clear that the advocates of big government, of course, take a paternalistic attitude to their fellow Australians. We recall the devastation, the destruction, of business and community confidence during the Labor years-the increase in inflation, a massive upward movement in the number of those unemployed and the large number of businesses, large and small, that were forced to the wall. Our commitment to small government has been a consistent reflection of our liberal philosophy. The benefits of this commitment are now a matter of record. That record, I would have thought, would be very clear to the House indeed.
        </para>
        <para>
         I am sure that both sides of this Parliament are very much aware of what steps have been sought by the Committee of Review. I might say that some of the recommendations which have been brought down will not bear a sense of enchantment into some areas of the business community. But the Prime Minister and senior Ministers of the Government, I am sure fully supported by the private members, are saying to the business community that no sector of this country at the present time can be quarantined from the reality of a review of this type. I will be perfectly happy to put to the business community and the manufacturing sector, as my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) will be putting to the mining sector and my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) will be putting to the primary industry sector, that all of these areas of business should properly be the subject of the application of the policies which are the subject of the statement brought down today by the Prime Minister.
        </para>
        <para>
         These will open up very significant opportunities for private enterprise in Australia. That is what this debate is all about. Our responsibility as a government is to restore confidence and stability to the Australian community. This review is a significant and a very important step in that direction. It is a move away from the tyranny of big government, a move in favour of a restoration of individual initiative and endeavour. All members on this side of the House support the statement which has been made by the Prime Minister. It is a very significant step forward for Australia and, as such, it commends the attention, the support and the endorsement of all honourable gentlemen.

          —The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Lynch) seems to think that it is his role in this House to denigrate the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). Let me say that the Leader of the Opposition would buy and sell the Minister before breakfast. The Minister started off by talking about a pathetic presentation; he certainly lived up to his own description because his speech was certainly a pathetic presentation, particularly from one who chaired the so-called razor gang and who presumably is more acquainted with its dealings and its supposed rationale than any other honourable member. Yet he gave us precious little idea of what really lay behind the statement other than the fact that it was based on absolute ideology, which of course it is. It was not a statement about economic rationality. It was a statement about Liberal Party and, presumably, National Country Party ideology. It was about ideology, not rationality.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         The Minister for Industry and Commerce also talked about the tax impost and the burden under the Labor Government. Let me say again, as the Minister well knows, that this Government is the highest tax government in our history. Never before have taxes been as high a proportion of the gross domestic product as they are at the present time. It is not for the Minister to start casting aspersions on the Labor Government with regard to taxation because this Government is the highest tax government in our history. It has imposed the highest interest rates in our history. We have the highest actual number of unemployed in our history under this Government. This Government has precious little to boast about in relation to the economic management of this country.
        </para>
        <para>
         Let me firstly make a point clear before I deal with the statement in more detail. That point is that Labor does not support waste and inefficiency in the Public Service or in government enterprise generally, nor does it support the continuance of programs which have outlived their usefulness. We proved this in office. In 1973 one of the first acts of the Labor Government was to establish a review of the previous Government's program. Many members opposite did not like it when that review was completed and the Labor Government sought to implement various of those recommendations. But it was an effective review of the programs of the previous Government. It sought to cull out areas of inefficiency in government expenditure and in taxation. We also established the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration-a very important decision indeed-which royal commission brought down very important findings which this Government has largely ignored. Those findings were very much about the efficient operation of the Australian Public Service.
        </para>
        <para>
         We also supported the establishment of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure and we have co-operated fully with the Expenditure Committee in its activities. We believe that that is a worthwhile activity to be pursued. We also supported the introduction of efficiency audits. Efficiency audits are in a pilot stage but they are an important development, one which we applauded and one with which we would certainly continue in office. Indeed, we would take it past the efficiency audit stage, which is an audit not of the finances of government departments but of the efficiency with which they carry out their operations, to the next stage, which is a program evaluation review which ensures that programs which set out to achieve a certain purpose are, in fact, achieving that purpose. So, our credentials in this area are clear.
        </para>
        <para>
         We are certainly against waste and inefficiency in the Public Service and in the government sector in general. We have sought when in government and in Opposition to get rid of inefficiency and wastefulness. But we cannot support what is being done now by this Government because what has been brought down today by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is an exercise not in increasing the efficiency of the public sector but rather in dismembering the public sector.
        </para>
        <para>
         The rationale for this dismemberment is based on several completely unsubstantiated and totally false assumptions. Those assumptions are: Firstly, that the public sector is too large and inefficient; secondly, that the market is the most efficient allocator of resources, so regulation is absolutely unwarranted; thirdly, that the private sector is more efficient than the public sector; and fourthly, that cutting the public sector is necessary to obtain tax reductions. Those are the four assumptions on which this enormously long statement made today by the Prime Minister was based.
        </para>
        <para>
         Let me refer in some detail to those four assumptions. The first one is about the public sector being too large and inefficient. It is a fact that we have one of the smallest public sectors of any country in the Western developed world. The only countries that have public sectors of the same size as ours are those economic dynamos such as Spain and Greece-the poor men of Europe. The rich countries of Europe have much bigger public sectors than we do. In many cases they are wealthier countries, in terms of the income produced per head, than we are. Certainly having a larger public sector does not seem to destroy their ability to create a decent standard of living for their people. So it is absurd to suggest that the public sector in Australia is so large by comparison with other countries that it must be cut back so it will not inhibit the future growth of our economy. There is nothing in international comparisons to demonstrate that our public sector is too large. Certainly it cannot be argued that a large public sector is inhibiting Australia's economic growth.
        </para>
        <para>
         There has never been big government in Australia. The Prime Minister said that we have had only a short taste of big government and that was when the Australian Labor Party was in office. That is an absolutely absurd statement. Taking public expenditure as a proportion of the gross domestic product, as a test of big government, we did not have big government because when Labor was in office we had virtually the smallest public sector of any economy in the Western world. So how can the Government say that under Labor we had big government? There must have been enormous government in the developed world if we had big government under Labor. We had one of the smallest public sectors of any of the developed countries in the Western world. To say that Labor gave us big government, is an absolute nonsense and an absolute falsehood.
        </para>
        <para>
         There is no evidence that the public sector is crowding out the private sector, as the Government claims. Time and again in the Prime Minister's statement we heard this talk about crowding out. The Government says that the public sector is too large and there is no room for the private sector to grow and really do its thing. What is the evidence for that? None is given in the Prime Minister's statement. The pathetic performance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) gave us no inkling of this. So far there is no evidence whatever. I challenge future speakers in this debate on the Government side to give us one skerrick of evidence that there is any crowding out of the private sector by the public sector in Australia at present, either physically or financially. The statement of the Prime Minister implies that it is both. How can one say that the private sector is being physically squeezed out by the public sector in Australia when we have half a million unemployed. The Government cannot tell us that we cannot get any workers. There might be some problem on the margin about skilled workers but that is because this Government did not do enough about making sure there was an adequate supply of skilled labour. It is absurd to use that as an excuse to start cutting back on the public sector.
        </para>
        <para>
         Also there is still a large unused capacity in industry. How can the Government talk about the physical crowding out of the private sector by the public sector when there is a whole lot of unused capacity in our manufacturing and other industries. Where is the evidence of the financial crowding out? Where is the evidence that the public sector is financially crowding out the private sector by increasing interest rates? The fact is that public sector capital expenditure has fallen by 8 per cent in real terms since 1975-76. The real level of capital expenditure by Government is much less now than it was when Labor was in office, including all the infrastructure projects. The public sector borrowing requirement peaked in 1978-79 at 5.6 per cent. It is now down to around 3.5 per cent. If the public sector borrowing requirement is so important in causing high interest rates and increasing inflation, which the Government suggests, and crowding out the public sector, why did the highest public sector borrowing requirement on record correspond with the lowest interest rates and rate of inflation in recent years? Why is it that both are now rising while the public sector borrowing requirement is falling? This whole argument about crowding out is an absolute absurdity. There is just no justification for it whatsoever at present, nor indeed was there any evidence in the past that crowding out took place when Labor was in office.
        </para>
        <para>
         Perhaps some argument about this might have been developed for a short time in 1973, but the statement by the Prime Minister that the growth of unemployment in Australia in 1974-75 was because of the crowding out of the private sector by the public sector, is absolute absurd nonsense. There was unemployment in Australia at that time because, as everyone knows, there was a world-wide recession from which every country, including Australia, suffered. Our performance in respect of the level of economic activity and unemployment, compared with that of other countries, was very good. If the public sector was the problem, it seems not to have been as much of a problem as it was in other countries.
        </para>
        <para>
         There is no evidence, either, of an inefficient public sector warranting staff reductions. On the contrary, the Auditor-General's report shows that inefficiency in the Public Service is being created not because there are too many staff but because there is a lack of staff. The Auditor-General's report shows that in department after department inefficiency is created by the staff ceilings which have been imposed by this Government. Those departments are unable to carry out their tasks because of the shortage of labour with which to carry them out. To argue that the Government needs to reduce staff ceilings because there is inefficiency and waste in the Public Service does not square with the facts.
        </para>
        <para>
         The second assumption was that the market is the most efficient allocator of resources, so regulation is unwarranted and would interfere with consumers' choice. Again, that is an absurd assumption. The Government assumes that the market is virtually perfect, that is, that consumers have an enormous say in what is produced, that there is a multiplicity of producers, and that there is no monopoly or oligopoly in our economy. That is absolute nonsense. We have monopoly or oligopoly in almost every industry in this country. The consumers do not decide what happens. We have a situation in which big business, in the absence of government regulation in particular, is able to get prices, to indulge in restrictive practices, and to create wants through advertising; in other words, to manipulate the market in various ways to its own benefit, not to the benefit of consumers. To argue that we have some sort of perfect market, the regulation of which only adds to its costs and creates inefficiency, is an absolute absurdity. These people are not living in the real world. They are living in some fantasy world. The real world in Australia is one of monopoly and oligopoly in industry after industry. If we have that system, then we have to have effective price regulation through such bodies as the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Trade Practices Commission. We should have interest rate controls. If we abolish them, as the Treasurer (Mr Howard) wants to do, we will have higher interest rates. He knows that and supports that principle.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Opposition is totally opposed to what the Government is doing in this whole area of regulation because it is based on a totally false assumption. Of course, selling government enterprises will reduce competition. If we sell Trans-Australia Airlines and it is taken over by Ansett Airlines of Australia, as it most likely would be eventually, then we will have a monopoly. Does the Government think that will produce a better result for travellers than we would get by having two competing airlines? If we sell the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation it most likely will be bought up by the second biggest housing loan body, a privately owned company, which would then control about 90 per cent of the market and therefore have a virtual monopoly.
        </para>
        <para>
         The third assumption is that the private sector is more efficient than the public sector. Again, there is not a skerrick of evidence of that. We have a multiplicity of efficient public sector enterprises. The Commonwealth Banking Corporation, just to name one, is one of the most profitable enterprises in this country. To say, without any proof, that the private sector is more efficient than the public sector is to do nothing other than express an ideological belief. The reality is that public sector enterprise can be just as efficient as private enterprise and may be more efficient in some cases.
        </para>
        <para>
         The fourth assumption is that cutting the public sector is necessary to obtain tax reductions. In our view, slashing the public sector is not necessary to produce tax cuts. The Government clearly is embarrassed at the rise in the tax burden that has occurred in its period of office, so cuts in the public sector are seen as the way in which to provide tax cuts. This is highly unlikely to occur, because, firstly, the Government announced just yesterday that it was abolishing tax indexation. However, it does not look like a tax cutting government if it is also abolishing tax indexation which guarantees some form of tax cuts to taxpayers in the future. Secondly, with the handing over of a whole variety of functions to the States, there is the distinct prospect that the States will be forced to bring in stage 2 of this Government's federalism policy and impose their own income tax on the people in the States. If the States are given more responsibilities obviously they have to finance those responsibilities in some way. Therefore, this Government is putting the States in a situation where they will increasingly be faced with the reality of having to introduce their own income tax. The Government wants that to happen; we all know that. It passed legislation for that to happen. These measures today must be seen as a further step towards this Government's determination to ensure that the States impose their own income tax.

          —If ever I entertained any doubts about the philosophical sharpness and clarity of the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to the House this afternoon, they have been totally swept away and disabused by the response of the Opposition to this statement. This statement and the response of the Opposition have demonstrated what a sharp philosophical difference there is between we on this side of the House and the Opposition about the size and role of government in Australia. It has opened up for the Australian community a fundamental debate about priorities and a fundamental debate about where we all stand on the capacity and the wisdom of individuals to make decisions about their own future and where we all stand on the wisdom and capacity of governments to make decisions about the future of individuals.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         The statement delivered by the Prime Minister this afternoon brought to this Parliament the report of a committee established immediately after the last election. It gave very eloquent expression to the basic philosophy of the government parties in Australia about the size and role of government in this country. It gives expression to that philosophy which has been so strongly endorsed on three occasions by the Australian people. It gives expression to the view enunciated so clearly by the Prime Minister both before and during the election campaign in 1975. This report is not only a report about the economic views of this Government, it is not only a report about the economic directions in which this Government believes Australia should be headed but also it is a report about the basic philosophy of this Government as to the role and functions of government. It overwhelmingly endorses the belief of members on this side of the House in the innate capacity of individuals to make better decisions about their future than the capacity of government. It highlights-of course the response of the Opposition highlights just as sharply-that fundamental difference that does exist between us. It is a difference that honourable members do not have to take my word about but a difference which was spelt out very eloquently by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in that now famous address of his made on 2 March 1979, the F. E. Chamberlain Memorial Lecture, when he said:
        </para>
        <para>
         The challenge to traditional democratic socialism has been expressed in a number of deeply dispiriting doctrines.
        </para>
        <para>
         One example, is the rapid spread of philosophies based on lower taxes and smaller government. Fraserism was one of the earliest expressions of these philosophies . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         Those were the words of the Leader of the Opposition on 2 March 1979. He continued:
        </para>
        <para>
         This sort of approach strikes directly at conventional democratic socialist notion that equality and equity can only be assured by a stronger public sector.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is the basic philosophical difference put in a nutshell by the Leader of the Opposition as recently as March 1979. It was endorsed in the same year by my opponent, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who is the shadow Treasurer, when he said in addressing a meeting of Labor economists in Queensland that one of the first tasks of a Labor government, if elected in 1983, would be to persuade the Australian people to pay the higher taxes that would be needed to build a larger public sector. Those are the philosophical roots of the Opposition in this Parliament. Those are the words out of the mouths of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer as to where the Australian Labor Party stands in terms of economic philosophy and in terms of its philosophy about the size of government.
        </para>
        <para>
         What I welcome most about this debate on the Prime Minister's statement about this review of Commonwealth functions is that it provides to the Australian people one of the all too rare opportunities to recognise that there are fundamental differences between this side of the House and the other side of the House, that basically we have a different view of how the lives of Australians should operate, that basically we believe that Australian individuals are far better able to conduct their lives and to make decisions. I believe that the philosophical difference that this particular statement has opened up is of profound significance. Every response of the Opposition since the statement was delivered this afternoon is testimony to the extent to which the Opposition rejects the economic and political philosophies for which the Government stands. This statement is a very significant statement, although it is one of a series of statements which have demonstrated the commitment of this Government to the cause of smaller government and greater individual decision-making.
        </para>
        <para>
         In the course of their remarks, both the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Gellibrand questioned the belief that this Government has in the basic efficiency of the market mechanism. We make no apology for believing that markets are infinitely better able to make economic decisions than government. No market is perfect and no person on this side of the House has ever argued to that effect. But there is a long catalogue of failure so far as government intervention in economic affairs of nations is concerned. If the honourable member for Gellibrand wants some examples of inefficient government intervention in business undertakings, I invite him to look at some of the state-owned and subsidised business undertakings of Western Europe. I invite him to look at enterprises such as British Steel. I invite him to look at some of the other state-owned enterprises of Western Europe which are prize examples of the utter failure of the sort of economic dogma that was espoused only a few moments ago by the honourable member for Gellibrand, who made it plain beyond any doubt that his party does stand for a high degree of regulation, a high degree of state intervention and a high degree of state ownership.
        </para>
        <para>
         It has been a fundamental working rule of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions, whose report was presented this afternoon, that those things which might be more efficiently done by private enterprise ought to be done by private enterprise, that it is not the business or the role of government to be involved in private enterprise activities, that it is the role and function of government to provide an economic climate in which private enterprise can function efficiently and then leave it to the enterprise, initiative and skill of individual businessmen to make business decisions properly inspired by the profit motive which is at the very basis of the capitalist system which I, certainly, have no bones at all about supporting.
        </para>
        <para>
         This report not only demonstrates our commitment to a free enterprise system, but also demonstrates our fundamental commitment to a federalist system of government. Unlike our opponents, we do not believe that all wisdom resides either in governments generally or in a central government located in Canberra. This report recognises the proper role of State governments so far as the distribution of power in our federation is concerned. This report demonstrates a commitment to the cause of decentralised government which endorses the approach of this Government over a period of 5 1/2 years to relations between the Federal and State governments. The real significance of this report and the statement delivered by the Prime Minister this afternoon is the way in which it very clearly and unambiguously spells out the philosophical position of parties on this side of the House so far as the size of government is concerned, so far as issues of regulation of business are concerned, and so far as the attitude of this Government to the innate capacity of individuals to make decisions about their own future is concerned.
        </para>
        <para>
         Many other very significant decisions will need to be taken by this Government in this general area over the next two or three years. As the Prime Minister observed, this Parliament will be receiving later this year a report from the Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System-a commission established over two years ago with the widest possible terms of reference to ask fundamental questions about the shape and direction of our financial system. I believe that that inquiry and that report will be of major and long term significance to the financial future of Australia. The same deregulatory approach which has been spelt out so clearly in the Prime Minister's statement tonight will also be adopted by the Government in responding to that report.
        </para>
        <para>
         I believe that the most significant thing that must be said about the report delivered by the Prime Minister this afternoon is that, notwithstanding our concern to achieve the greatest degree of efficiency and the greatest maximisation of the benefits of small government, we have been particularly careful to protect those programs which are of assistance to those in the community least able to support themselves. No program of income support to any Australian has been affected by the decisions of this review committee. Despite all the blustering of the Opposition, despite all of the attempts by the Opposition to categorise this report as paying service to big business in the Australian community, the truth is that this report has been particular even-handed and we have taken very great care to protect those programs which are of lasting significance to people more vulnerable and less able to support themselves than the great majority of the Australian community. That is very much in line with the approach of this Government over the past 5 1/2 years. Despite its determination to pursue policies of economic responsibility it has been possible within the framework of following those policies to preserve maximum support for those programs which look after individuals who need assistance.
        </para>
        <para>
         Perhaps the most surprising of the responses of the Opposition was the claim that in some way the policies of this Government, of which this report is the latest demonstration, have not produced the results that we set out to achieve some 5 1/2 years ago. Nobody can deny the fact that the Australian economy at present is performing in a way which is the envy of the industrialised world. Businessman after businessman who visits this country from other parts of the world knows just how well the Australian economy is performing in comparison with many of the other economies of the industrialised world. This country has a non-farm growth rate of over 4 per cent in today's conditions of subdued world trade and almost recession in large parts of the industrialised world. Is that the performance of an economy in recession or in slump? Is that the performance of an economy which is managed by a government whose economic policies are failing? Of course it is not. This country's inflation rate is significantly below the average of the industrialised world. Is that the performance of a country whose economic policies are not appropriate? The truth of the matter is that the economic policies and practices of this Government over the past 5 1/2 years have yielded results-results which are beyond the expectations that many of us on this side of the House entertained only 12 months ago. The fact is that the great majority of the economic indicators now in April 1981 are running very much ahead of what we thought they would be in August 1980 when the last Budget was brought down.
        </para>
        <para>
         The statement delivered by the Prime Minister this afternoon clearly and starkly identifies for the Australian people the philosophical position of this Government on great matters of economic and political principle. It opens up very clearly the basic differences between us on the Government side of the House and those who sit opposite. The response of the Labor Opposition tonight shows precisely where the Australian Labor Party stands on the question of the size of government once a debate is put on a philosophical basis. Members of the Opposition have demonstrated by their response tonight that they have not changed their attitudes, that they are still at heart the people who between 1972 and 1975 believed that governments and not individuals could solve all problems. They believe, as their leader said in 1979, that principles of small government are deeply dispiriting doctrines. I believe that over coming months we on this side of the House will have ample opportunity to demonstrate to the Labor Opposition that the great majority of the Australian people, far from believing that principles of small government are deeply dispiriting, will embrace and support those principles.

          —The most charitable thing that I can say about the contribution of the Treasurer (Mr Howard)-I think that I am a charitable man, even if nobody else thinks so-is that it was a load of old codswallop. He talked about philosophy. Let me tell him, the House and the people of this country that we on the Labor side of this Parliament also have a philosophy. That philosophy, which we are proud of, emphasises a partnership between the public and the private sectors. It has no part whatsoever for the mutilation of the public sector which is the message of this document which we are debating tonight. We also have a philosophy which means that the market has a part in the government of this country. That market is on tap, not on top. We are not worshipping at the altar of this market, as these people are, in handing over everything to the private sector. We do not deny the value of the market. The market will not run us. We believe that this Parliament and the Government of this nation should make the decisions in the interests of the Australian people and not leave it to that false philosophy which the Treasurer has talked about.

         So let us not be misled by this rhetoric. This Review of Commonwealth Functions has one main objective and that, of course, is to reduce government spending, whatever the purpose of that government spending. The Government is hell bent on reducing that government spending so that something is left over to fill the pockets of those who put the Government in power. There has never been a more cynical group of people in the history of any government of any country than this group which governs us now. The Government allows us to believe that it has a philosophy when its so-called philosophy is nothing more or less than to put money into the pockets of those who will contribute to the sinews of policitical war when the time comes.
        </para>
        <para>
         Whereas political purpose and that of my colleagues in the Australian Labor Party is to reduce, I am proud to say, inequalities in our community, the purpose of our political opponents is to increase those inequalities. That is precisely what they are doing in so many of the decisions which have been announced in this disgraceful document which we are debating now. We want to assist those who have less at the expense of those who have more; whereas the Government has set out time and again to assist those who have more at the expense of those who have less. We are confident that the vast majority of our fellow Australians, given a fair choice, will opt for helping those in need so that we can all live in a fairer society. Our support comes not only from those who will benefit from this fairer society, but also from those good people with a social conscience who want to live in a fairer society. They are certainly not getting anything from the decisions announced in this document which will suit their social conscience.
        </para>
        <para>
         So many of the Government functions which have been cut or abolished in this announcement today assisted ordinary people in need. Let us look at some of them. The Prices Justification Tribunal has been eliminated. What was the purpose of the PJT other than to be a watchdog on prices for ordinary people in this community? It is to go. I would like say more about it now, but I will have to leave that until later. Rent control in the Australian Capital Territory will be abolished. That is another example. Why was that control in existence other than to help ordinary people, those who have less in this community? That control will be abolished as a result of the announcement in this document which we are debating. I repeat: It was there to protect the needy.

         There are the health changes that we learnt about yesterday. As a result of those changes, the more wealth people have the better health coverage they will be able to afford and the better tax rebate they will receive. What are being squeezed? Of course, it is the public hospitals. What is the purpose of public hospitals? It is to help those people in greatest need. Yet the announcements will lead to a reduction in the standards that will be provided by the public hospitals. That is another example of increasing inequalities, which will increase divisiveness and confrontation in this community, which seems to be the main and only purpose of so many of the decisions of this Fraser Government.

         Let us look at the education cuts we learnt about today. What about the $80,000 deficit of a Dominican convent in the city of Adelaide, which I am proud to represent? Where will it get $80,000 from? The parents of the children at that school are the most needy, the most deserving of help in our community. Because the education system employed in that school is innovative in order to cater for the special needs of deprived children, education at that school is more expensive than it is at so many other schools. It caters for the needs of the children of Vietnamese refugees, recent migrants, single parent families-good people with special needs requiring special attention.
        </para>
        <para>
         In this calendar year the Mother Superior of that convent has to wrestle with the enormous problem of funding a deficit of $80,000 and she has nowhere to turn to. Where did she hope to turn to? Of course, it was to the Australian Government, to the Schools Commission. What will she learn from tomorrow morning's newspaper, if she is not listening to the news tonight? She will read that the Schools Commission's functions are being obliterated. She will read that she cannot hope to be helped by the Commonwealth Government. That is what this Fraser Government is doing. It is adding to her burdens. That is what this review has done. It is adding insult to past injuries.
        </para>
        <para>
         The State offices of the Schools Commission are to be eliminated. The Commission no longer will be involved in program administration and information collection. Even the buildings unit of that Schools Commission will be eliminated. That is a perfect example of increasing inequalities in the community in which we live. It is a perfect example, under the heading 'Education', of public expenditure which is applied to those people who have the greatest need being reduced or eliminated. For what purpose is that being done? It is being done so that there will be more money for a cynical government to put into the pockets of its supporters when it comes to election time so that it will be re-elected for its cynical purposes of increasing the inequalities in the Australian community. The Government wonders why there are strikes, why there is divisiveness. It wonders why we are not a cohesive nation as is Japan, getting on with increasing the rate of growth in the community. The Government wonders why that is so, yet it is its policies which are creating that great divisiveness.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is only the first point I want to make. The second point relates to the economic justification for this document, because that too is gravely false. In other words, the ideological basis for this fiscal impoverishment which this Government is favouring, which is the subject of this document, has absolutely no economic or social justification. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) asserted in his speech:
        </para>
        <para>
         . . . more limited government is now encouraging massive job creation.
        </para>
        <para>
         What rot! He repeated his opinion that a reduction in government programs and jobs leads to increased economic growth and employment. That is equally rot. It is totally absurd. It contradicts the views he expressed in 1974 when he was looking for a political future, when he described the fundamental views of Keynes as providing some hope for the world. It contradicts the policy now being pursued in such economically successful countries as Japan where monetary policy is being relaxed right now, where public spending on construction projects is being brought forward-it is being increased-and greater incentives are being offered to the smaller and medium sized businesses right now.
        </para>
        <para>
         The return of the Treasurer to this chamber has reminded me that I wanted to emphasise the hardship the measures announced today will cause to the small business people in this community who rely on government enterprise, government programs. They will be devastated as so many people in social need will be devastated by these measures. Let me come back to the false economic background to this document. The manic concern of the Fraser gang to cut the deficit is not shared in other countries. I have mentioned Japan. It has run larger deficits than Australia throughout the past decade. It is not just larger deficits in total. It is larger deficits per capita. There is nothing wrong with large deficits provided the money is being used to help unemployed people and to aid the development of resources. Yet we have this false doctrine being perpetrated for a false purpose and that is reducing the size of the public sector. Why? The reason is that the public sector helps those in greatest need and the money that will be left over will be handed out to the supporters of this political party as that is the cynical way in which it operates.
        </para>
        <para>
         Perhaps the greatest significance of all is the return to fiscal stringency in 1981 which contradicts the Government's own policies of the past 18 months and it is the very opposite of that stance which led to the modest employment growth of 1980. The year 1980 was an election year and in terms of economic management it was characterised by an uncharacteristic leniency on the part of this Government. They are the words I would use had I forgotten about this Government's cynicism. But of course in an election year this Government is a lot more lenient. It is doing these things now so that it can be lenient in the next election year. Hang all those who will suffer because of what the Government is doing now, as long as it gets some credit when it is more lenient in an election year.
        </para>
        <para>
         Throughout 1979-80 and the first half of 1980-81 monetary growth was significantly in excess of the Government's stated target and allowed for growth in economic activity of at least 3 per cent a year. At the same time, the Government increased its spending in real terms. The increase in outlays in real terms was more than 5 per cent over the second half of last year. At that time the Government ran a deficit of no less than $4,183m. It was this relatively expansionary fiscal and monetary policy more than any other factor which led to the economic growth and job creation of 1980 and which the Treasurer trumpets to us as being the result of his fiscal stringency. I repeat, that the Government briefly adopted a macroeconomic stance similar to that long advocated by the Labor Party and accordingly the economy responded in a brief spring of recovery. But despite the fact that this recent experience stands in direct contradiction to the unyielding ignorance and rhetoric, such as that we have heard from the Treasurer and from the Fraser Administration generally, we are now witnessing a reassertion of that restrictionist approach.
        </para>
        <para>
         Money supply, although still growing outside the Government's target, is being reined in. Moreover, the massive tax take now under way, coupled with the new spending cuts that we have learned about, will mean that the Government will take in much more revenue than it will outlay in the current period. A credit squeeze is under way. I would love to say a lot more about that but my time in this debate is running out.
        </para>
        <para>
         I want to move on to the next point that I need to make and that is that in this destructive way much is being done which will hurt so many separate factors, not only the one I have mentioned. My third point relates to the specific policies which the Government announced today. Some of these policies have the effect of stepping back from Australia's long standing process of nation building and instead embracing fragmentation and destructive rivalry between the States. National responsibilities are being abdicated. For example, the regional centres of Australia are no longer to be assisted through the regional development program. The Government now has no regional policy. The concept of national cohesion through economic equality, an essential tenet of policy in most other countries, has no place in the Fraser ideology.
        </para>
        <para>
         The fourth point I would like to make relates to my specific area of responsibility, industry and commerce. This country requires 1 1/2 million new jobs. Resources expansion will provide only about one-third of those jobs. We need special help for industry. Yet this document that we are debating tonight announces policies which mean a destruction of a lot of those policies for commerce and industry-policies which would have made us more competitive, would have got us into the world markets and made sure that more jobs were created, a major objective of the Australian Labor Party.

          —The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) complained because the Government will no longer expect the taxpayers-many of whom are not well off-to pay for free hospital out-patient and in-patient care for those who are well off and who have not bothered to insure themselves. That is what the honourable member for Adelaide was getting into a lather about. The honourable member for Adelaide got into a lather about a number of vested interests in this community being clipped in the course of this statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the Review of Commonwealth Functions. The statement was the result of an examination over some months. The Review of Commonwealth Functions was chaired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch). If anybody in the Opposition had cared to listen to the statement or to read it he would have found that at every point in it-this applies also to the statement delivered yesterday by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar)-there is great care not to attack any of the basic social security provisions and there is great care to ensure that pensioners and the disadvantaged are catered for. The underlying philosophy of the statement is that the taxpayers' funds will be taken only when there is a clearly demonstrated need for their use.
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
         What the honourable member for Adelaide is trying to defend in this House are the vested interests of those who might wish to extend their own work in providing services and deciding for people the kind of services that they ought to have. I have to confess that after reading for some months in the Press that a review of great proportion was being undertaken by the Government and after reading that this had been turned by the Press into a 'razor gang', I expected some form of expenditure cutting. That would be a fairly simple operation, I suppose. I expected something that might have caused perhaps even more pain than that which has been squealed about by the Opposition. I must confess that somewhat to my surprise we have not just a razor gang operation, not just a cutting operation, but a statement of direction and philosophy which I think takes Australia into the next decade.
        </para>
        <para>
         I welcome this statement as the clearest statement of direction of the Government since it came to office in 1975. It clarified all the Government's principles in practical terms and gave a commitment to further action in a way which will create economic growth, which is really the only way to help the disadvantaged in the Australian community in the longer term. The actions of the Wilson Government in the United Kingdom between 1964 and 1970 were analysed by the Fabian Society which reported that it achieved absolutely nothing for the most disadvantaged in the United Kingdom. In fact the Fabian Society concluded that those who were least well off when Mr Wilson came into office were worse off when he went out of office despite an enormous number of additional social programs introduced by that Labour Government. The honourable member for Adelaide has espoused exactly the same principles as were espoused by Mr Wilson. I would not accuse him, as he has accused us, of bad intentions. I would not accuse him of the cynicism of which he has accused us. I would credit him with good intentions. But those good intentions lead him, with his socialist philosophy, to believe that an expanded Public Service helps those in greatest need. That philosophy is challenged conclusively by this ministerial statement.

         What we are talking about fundamentally is individual choice, which in fact is widest in a free market situation. The difference between a market choice and a bureaucratic choice is that in a market the customer can go to various suppliers, can bargain, can expect innovation, can expect people to go out of business if they do not provide what he or she wants, and can expect advertising and all other aspects of a market to inform him or her of what is available.

          —Markets do not always work, I am glad to inform the honourable member, and that is fully acknowledged by the Government. Markets do not work in a couple of ways. Firstly, they do not work if there are no suitable regulatory controls to ensure competition. Private enterprise does not equal competitive enterprise, but regulation has to be in the direction of competition and not in the direction of featherbedding and protection. The whole thrust of this paper, I am pleased to say, is in the direction of removing the kind of regulation which featherbeds and protects. The second way in which the market does not always work is when some consumers do not, as my honourable friend says, have the wherewithal to make a market choice. It is in those cases, and not in the cases of those who are better off, and who under existing schemes are able to go to hospitals and get free treatment when they can well pay for it, who have to be looked after by Public Service systems and by government intervention. The Government fully supports that kind of intervention when it is necessary.

        <para>
         We have a public sector which is severely overloaded. I accept what the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) said. Our public sector in this country is still not as large as it is in some other countries. That is quite true, but it is still overloaded. How much control do we members of this Parliament have over the myriad of departments, corporations, commissions, boards, committees and agencies for which we nominally are responsible? How much can we do about a complaint we get about the service of the Government monopoly in telecommunications? We can do a bit but we cannot do much. When it is suggested that the Government will introduce a new service, do we have any real confidence that the creaking mechanism of delivery will operate at least half as efficiently and to the customers' satisfaction as a new business anxious to please its customers?
        </para>
        <para>
         Our public sector employment fundamentally is not appropriate for operating areas. The public service was set up over the centuries for policy advice and for certain regulatory functions. In order to avoid corruption through political manipulation, principles of permanency and in the case of our own Public Service, adequate retirement allowances appropriate for policy advisers, were set in place. Those people must be independent of politics, and those arrangements are quite satisfactory for that type of employment. But permanency and these other considerations are wrong, surely, for operations such as Trans-Australia Airlines, Telecom Australia, for traffic controllers and the like. They are expensive, they are inflexible, and certainly they are more subject to union monopoly control. For example, the traffic controllers had complaints about their pay which, because of Public Service relativities, could not be adjusted as it might have been in the private sector, and they went on strike.
        </para>
        <para>
         Extending the public sector also creates a self-serving delivery mechanism which arrogates the decision as to what the consumer ought to want. It seeks to replace not only the independent choice of the consumer in a competitive market but it also challenges ultimately the right of the Parliament to redress the balance on behalf of the people. This expanding non-democratic bureaucracy is represented in this chamber by the Australian Labor Party. The public servant who seeks to serve in an honourable way is represented-I hope-by every member of this Parliament.
        </para>
        <para>
         Let me turn to some of the specific provisions in the ministerial statement. I welcome absolutely the commitment by the Government to re-examine the monopoly positions of Australia Post and Telecom Australia. As we go into the communications age when the biggest expansion in business, activity, learning and the transmission of knowledge will be in the area of communications, surely it is extraordinarily dangerous to have all the decisions as to where we will go in relation to that area in the hands of one set of engineers and one set of managers. Surely that is dangerous, as it is dangerous to have our livelihood for the future, the whole of our communications system, in the hands of one public sector union. I suggest that this is one of the farsighted decisions in this statement.

         The field of airlines was one in which, during the earlier stages of our development, it was appropriate to have certain arrangements to ensure that we did not have a government monopoly. There were certain arrangements in the early days of aviation overseas where it was a good idea to have strict controls over our overseas airline, but I am glad to see that now the Government has agreed that Qantas Airways Ltd should be able to set its own minimum fares in a competitive situation. I also see that the Government has com- mitted itself once again to an inquiry into the deregulation of the airline industry. It has committed itself to consider selling off the domestic airline terminals. I hope that these terminals would not be sold necessarily to airlines but to independent business operators who would be able to receive an aircraft of any company as a prelude to deregulation. Deregulation of the airline industry in Australia will not be possible without terminals which are open to any carrier.
        </para>
        <para>
         The fundamental question is, who will buy them? Frankly, we in this Parliament do not have the capacity or the facilities to decide in what sort of aircraft people should travel, at what times they should go and what fares they should pay any more than we should decide what should be stocked on supermarket shelves. That is the direction in which the Government is committing itself; that is a direction which I certainly shall be working to achieve, both in the domestic and international airline areas. I also see that there is a commitment to deregulate the Australian National Line and the Australian National Railways and to end the extraordinary featherbedding that has occurred in the area of transport in a country which relies for its very livelihood on cheap transport.

         The Prices Justification Tribunal is to go, and I link this in with airlines, railways and so on. A justified price is a price which finishes up too high. The only real justification for a price is when it can be obtained in a market where buyers are looking for the best price. Any form of justification where people come forward with their books and justify the price, and the prices are looked at by a bureaucratic mechanism, can never determine whether that is the best price. In the long run, it is never the best price. The controlled price of bread in New South Wales is higher than the uncontrolled price of bread in Queensland. I note with some caution changes to the Industries Assistance Commission and the Trade Practices Tribunal. It is very important that any changes in these two bodies should not detract from their capacity to monitor the competitiveness of industry. Competitiveness can be brought about either by the removal of domestic monopoly or the removal of a monopoly created by tariff walls. It will be desperately important as we review the functions of these two bodies that we do not remove those regulatory and advisory functions which move in the direction of competition. The whole thrust of this superb document is to move away from the regulation which featherbeds, inhibits and shackles Australians, but to maintain the necessary government regulations which will promote competition, consumer choice, lower prices, and ultimately a freer society.

          —Today the people of Canberra have been sold out. I stress the word 'people' and I mean the public servants, the business people, the prospective home owners and the ordinary people in the streets. This is probably the cruelest example of ad hockery which has been so far hurled at the people of the Australian Capital Territory. Today Canberra has been sold out and both its public sector and its private sector will be reeling when they absorb the impact of this ideological battering.

         The razor gang's targets have been ad hoc and without consistent rationale. It is the nation's biggest garage sale, with the articles for sale being determined by ministerial whim. When we examine the functions sold out to the private sector in Canberra, they appear to have no co-ordinated pattern and do not fit into any long term plan for the Territory. For example, the sale of land is to be given to the private sector alone. It alone will have control over the sale of residential and commercial land, including over-the-counter sales. No explanation is given as to what this means for the long term future of Canberra. Is there still a plan for Canberra's expansion and growth? Does the National Capital Development Commission's master plan still apply? Does this mean wholesale speculation in land for Canberra, after the style of Melbourne and Sydney? How are prices to be determined? Will any controls or regulations on the sale of land apply? What will this mean to new home buyers and families? Will they now face spiralling land prices?
        </para>
        <para>
         All these questions remain unanswered. Recreational and cultural facilities are to be sold or leased to the private sector. No explanation has been given as to what this means for the various sports facilities, theatres and other cultural facilities in Canberra. Which are to be sold? Which will remain under public control? This is an absolute farce. Who is going to buy a sports oval? No answers have been given by the Government on these vital questions for Canberra residents. Well known public enterprises such as the Belconnen Mall, run by the Canberra Commercial Development Authority, and the Canberra Retail Market Trust are to be sold. To be sold also is the Mugga quarry and the hotmix plant. The Government's real motivation appears to be its ideological obsession with private sector involvement in the economy. It fails to comprehend that in the Australian Capital Territory the public and private sectors are interdependent. To squeeze the one hurts the other. Many major capital works projects in the Australian Capital Territory which have been promised for years now are to be cancelled. These projects include the Canberra Convention Centre, the Museum of Australia, the Canberra Law Courts, the National Library extension, the Australian Federal Police headquarters, the headquarters of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the National Biological Standards Laboratory.

         Let me make a prediction tonight. Despite the transfer of government enterprises in the Australian Capital Territory to the private sector, in six months, probably three months, maybe even three days, the private sector will be cursing the so-called razor gang. The cutback in the public sector will further depress the Canberra economy, lower demand, increase unemployment, diminish investment and reduce profits. There is clearly no overall plan for Canberra in these latest developments. The latest cuts make a farce of any commitment to Canberra by the Federal Government. The private sector in Canberra can now have no confidence in the Fraser Government. This Government keeps no promises and is guided only by obsession with Canberra bashing.
        </para>
        <para>
         Let me now turn to the real failure of this review. The razor gang review is the latest of a series of major investigations of government administration over the last eight years. It is also the most cursory and the most ill-conceived, and it will do nothing to promote efficiency or reform in the Australian Public Service. The argument that savings in public sector expenditure somehow or other magically lead to increased prosperity for all Australians is in itself a subject of many objections. We should also recall that the March 1981 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Observer shows that of 24 OECD countries Australia is ranked near the bottom in current government expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product.
        </para>
        <para>
         Leaving aside this aspect, the Government's assertion that significant savings will be made by cuts in the Public Service is patently false. Let us look at the figures. If the number of government employees is cut across the board by, say, 2 per cent this will not achieve major savings in government expenditure. If we recall that expenditure on public servants' salaries represents only 9.35 per cent of total public sector outlay, we can see that a cut of 2 per cent represents a saving of only 0.175 per cent. In other words, for every $100 of total budgetary expenditure, cutbacks in staff represent a saving of 25c. This is an infinitesimal amount of savings and it will be achieved at enormous cost. Firstly, there is the cost of the Lynch review itself. I hope that the Government will make public the number of hours spent on this review and the total cost of this exercise to the taxpayers. Secondly, there is the cost to the Australian public. This Government has reduced services to the public. The Commonwealth Employment Service, the public housing sector, aged and disabled people, Aborigines, low income families and many others will be affected. The list goes on and on. This across-the-board cut in numbers provides a clear indication that the Government has no long term plan for government administration in this country and is merely concerned to conduct a cynical political exercise of blaming the economic ills of Australia on the Public Service. The public will not be hoodwinked in this way.
        </para>
        <para>
         When this ministerial committee was set up last year it was asked to review Commonwealth functions as a way of generating savings. The principle is clear. If functions are eliminated staff numbers are automatically diminished. This is an honest way to proceed but the razor gang was unable to do this. Besides eliminating functions it has insisted on a general across-the-board slash on Public Service numbers. In other words, it wants fewer people to do relatively more work. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) stated in corrrespondence with the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association last year that the Public Service had reached its lowest level. He said:
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government sees the initial process of streamlining the Public Service as now being substantially completed.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Auditor-General in his 1981 report to the Parliament highlighted the inefficiencies of the current staff ceilings. Yet the razor gang report establishes at least 22 reviews to be undertaken-I repeat 22 reviews-including the major reviews of the Department of Defence, the National Capital Development Commission, the Government laboratory facilities, a joint parliamentary committee on statutory bodies and a continuing ministerial review. Who will service all of these reviews? Will they be farmed out to the private sector also?
        </para>
        <para>
         If the Government were really concerned with the duplication of functions it might have taken notice of the speech made by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) in this House last Tuesday. Every function of the Public Service is now duplicated within the Prime Minister's own Department for no other purpose than to increase the Prime Minister's power and control.
        </para>

         If we refer to the details of the ministerial statement we see that the only change for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is to increase a function-an increase in the staff interchange program. Typical of the basically dishonest nature of this exercise is the treatment of the Industries Assistance Commission, the Trade Practices Commission, the Prices Justification Tribunal and other agencies which are intended to protect the public against the Government's friends. The Government does not have the honesty actually to reduce the legislative responsibilities of those bodies. However, it will effectively make it impossible to enforce the legislation by denying the bodies with statutory responsibility the staff to carry out their functions. What a contrast to the treatment of the Prime Minister's own Department.

         The third cost is to the quality of the Public Service itself and to the morale of its employees. Since 1975, 11,000 staff have been cut. The morale of the Public Service is at an all time low. Not only have public servants been required to fulfil more tasks with ever decreasing numbers, but at the same time they have been subjected by this Government to a cheap and nasty publicity campaign against the value of their work and, in some cases, against their personal integrity. The chairman of the committee is well known for his view that public servants have their snouts in the public taxation trough. Those ill-founded criticisms were rejected totally by Sir William Cole, Chairman of the Public Service Board, in his address last week to the Canberra chapter of the Institute of Internal Auditors, when he said:
        </para>
        <para>
         Criticisms of the Public Service receiving publicity have become increasingly outrageous with little apparent concern for truth, balance or fairness.
        </para>
        <para>
         Most public servants-including me-are fed up to the back teeth with these unfair, cowardly and counterproductive attacks.

         They could have not come at a more inappropriate time. For a decade now, the Public Service has faced challenge, change and turbulence almost unprecedented in its history.

         Particularly in recent years, work loads have grown markedly while the resources necessary for that work have been reduced-we have been doing more with less.

         At the same time, the accountability requirements upon Public Service decision making have grown dramatically . . .

         Public Service bashing by this Government has reached an all time high during the past five months. The inevitable outcome of such short sighted attitudes will be a loss of morale amongst employees, and the Service will fail to attract the best applicants. The big loser in this process, of course, is the Australian public once again.

        <para>
         I turn now to the specific provisions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. The Committee of Review was purported to be analysing Public Service functions. But over the past five months we have witnessed an intense lobbying campaign in which rumours and speculation on the likely future of many departmental sections have appeared to play a major part in the final outcome. It could have been termed a bun fight based on the rules of survival of the strongest and the most politically aligned to the Fraser Government. This report provides no justification for the destruction of so many services to the community. The Fraser Government is abrogating its responsibility to the people of Australia and transferring its responsibilities to the highest bidder. This is a government which has continually chopped and changed its mind and its policies. The basic argument against it is not only that its policies are wrong-though I believe they are-but also that it does not really care about the people that it is supposed to serve. I know that is a perception that people have of this Government. I have no doubt that that perception will spread to most sections of the Australian community when the implications of this horror document seep through.

         —Today I was granted leave to return to my electorate to visit many of the survivors from the horror of last night's fire at the Pacific Heights Nursing Home, Sylvania Heights. I took with me the sympathy and personal concern of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to the relatives of those who had lost aged relatives in Sylvania last night and comfort and encouragement to those many aged and disabled men and women who have survived this disaster. I know that all honourable members will support these sentiments. It was Sydney's worst fire disaster. I stand here tonight moved by the horrifying fact that 16 aged people in the twilight of their years were so gruesomely killed. I stand here moved by the resilience of those grand old and not so old folk who have survived an event which has shocked my district. Only five months ago five brave young bushfire volunteers were incinerated in a bush fire at Waterfall only a few miles from Sylvania.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the midst of the state of shock that confronted everyone last night there were acts of heroism and bravery as members of the staff of the Pacific Heights Nursing Home, young relatives of inmates, members of the fire brigade, and the New South Wales Police Force all worked with untiring and intrepid effort to rescue such a large number of inmates. To the relatives of those who perished will go the sympathy of all. Our prayers are for those souls who perished so gruesomely. Last night and today was a time also for concern for the survivors. This afternoon, as I visited quietly many of them in the St George Hospital and the Sutherland Hospital my heart was full to see so many of these folk still in a state of shock and wonder as to what had happened to them. Some may never recover fully from the state of shock in which they are now.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following my visit to the St George Hospital I would like to pay tribute to Miss Norma Shore, the Director of Nursing, Dr Falconer, Mr Lockwood, Mr Griffith, and to all the staff for what they have done. I pay tribute also to Sister Campbell and to the social workers who have worked untiringly and without sleep since the events of last night. At the Sutherland Hospital I pay tribute to Dr Macdessi, Miss Judy Gibson, Dr Alan Wood and to the countless number of nursing staff, nursing aides, wardsmen and everybody connected with the hospital who worked untiringly to help these people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Miss Judy Gibson, the Director of Nursing, perhaps summed up these events when she said: 'Sometimes there is criticism levelled that people cannot meet with crises'. Last night we saw two major hospitals in Sydney meet with what was a crisis in national terms. As I went among these people this afternoon the degree of effort, involvement, and the total lack of self-comfort and self-concern certainly was an inspiration to me. Gratitude must go to those who did so much last night. Our prayers must be for all those who today are surviving their condition of shock. For 16 families there is a tragic sense of loss.

         —I would like to raise a matter of grave concern to me, certainly to the electorate of Lyne and, I believe, to Australia. The matter concerns the disposal of garbage from the numerous ships anchored off Newcastle harbour. Over the week the fact has been raised with me that at times anything from a dozen to 40 ships-I have counted them myself-are anchored off the harbour. Of course, they have to dispose of the garbage. There are no means available to them other than bagging the garbage and throwing it over the side of the ship. Where it goes depends upon the winds and the tides. I believe that there is grave concern today within the Port Stephens Shire that a lot of the garbage is being washed up on the beaches somewhere in the vicinity of the Stockton Beach area. I do not think that I need stress the point that all of us should be very gravely concerned because of the possibility of disease that may happen to come in the garbage from the ships. Many of those ships, of course, are from Eastern countries. It is known, of course, that those countries have not only foot and mouth disease present but also other diseases that are of grave concern to Australia.

        I understand that this afternoon an inspector from the Port Stephens Shire went to inspect the beach. Over three kilometres of beach are strewn with a large amount of garbage and other goods. This is offensive to the people who use the beach. It is well known in that area that wild dogs, pigs and other animals feed upon the garbage. Naturally, we have always suspected that foot and mouth disease and other diseases could be brought here in garbage from these ships. Not only the Port Stephens area but also the Newcastle City Council area and other council areas along the New South Wales coastline might be affected. It is imperative, I believe, that the responsible Minister and department are fully aware of our responsibilities so far as the problem is concerned.

        We have a great responsibility to protect our herds within Australia because of our exports and our economy. Even at present there is a Bill before the Parliament that expresses the importance of strengthening the quarantine legislation within Australia. We do not want to see a situation in which these ships are allowed to anchor in the area. I know that this matter has not been raised by the honourable member from the Newcastle area who should be concerned. If a disease is brought into Australia the unions of the New- castle area stand condemned forever. This is a darned important issue so far as we are concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        The people of my electorate have suggested that I bring this matter before the Parliament. At this stage I do not know who is responsible but I believe that the matter should be looked into immediately. If the council is responsible it has a major job ahead because someone will have to go to sea in boats every day or every second day to collect the garbage. There is a quarantine station within the Newcastle area. I believe that it could be its responsibility to look into the matter. If it is the responsibility of the councils concerned well naturally they ought to be financially assisted by either the Commonwealth or the State government. The fact of the matter is that garbage is there. It is a danger to all Australians. It is a danger to our stock. It is a danger to our economy. It is a nuisance to all the people concerned. I believe that somebody has to accept responsibility.

         —I draw the attention of the House to part of the Governor-General's Speech given on 25 November 1980. It states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        My Government sets . . . out to establish that it cares deeply about the quality of life lived in Australia . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The statement brought into this House yesterday by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) directly contradicts this. Despite the fine words in which he wrapped his bitter pill the quality of life in Australia was under direct attack by the Government when he set out new arrangements for health care and for health funding. The School Dental Scheme has already suffered at the hands of this Government and, as usual, when these services are cut even further it will be the children of the low income earners and the pensioners who suffer. It always is the children of the low income earners, the unemployed, the disadvantaged and the pensioners who suffer. Those with the ability to pay can send their children to the dentist; those without the ability to pay will be relying on a school dentist, who will disappear. The dental hospital in Victoria cannot cope with the enormous waiting list it has now. With the demise of the School Dental Scheme the burden on this overloaded hospital will be even greater.
       </para>
       <para>
        What will happen to the community health centres? I have spoken about them in this House on several occasions. They were set up by the Labor governments of 1972 and 1975. They have proved their worth over and over again. If this Government is so concerned at the rising costs of health care, why is it initiating a new scheme that could well spell the death of community health centres? Prevention, early detection and treatment of illness and rehabilitation provided by community-based services such as those funded under the community health scheme can contain demands for admission to hospitals and other institutions. Admissions to the psychiatric and mental health sections of a hospital in a Victorian provincial city declined by 149 during six months of 1979 and by another 98 during the following six months. This was largely attributed to the operations of a community-based service.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is ludicrous for a government to keep prating about its care and concern for the Australian people when every piece of legislation introduced into this House provides for those with the ability to pay at the expense of those who cannot. Community health projects in Western Australia are responsible for the maintenance of over 1,000 clients in the community. During 1979-80 the cost of providing these services under the community health program was $1.2m. Had it been necessary for all these clients to be maintained in institutions during the same period, the cost would have been an estimated $21.3m. I remind honourable members of the words of the Bishop of Armidale in 1931 when he was asked to define the difference between the conservative parties and the Labor Party. He put it very simply: 'The conservatives are interested in profit, the Labor Party is interested in people'. Every piece of legislation that the Government brings into this House proves that statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I wish to comment on the women's refuges. They also are about to disappear. There are 96 women's refuges widely scattered throughout Australia. They provide essential services to women and their dependent children in crisis situations caused by physical and mental abuse, destitution, homelessness, and other factors. I point out that there is a significant voluntary contribution to women's refuges, both in donations and in voluntary work, and that such services were used during six months of last year by 6,300 women and 7,900 children. The Commonwealth used to meet 75 per cent of the operating costs and 50 per cent of the recurrent costs, with the States making up the balance. What will happen to the funding under this new arrangement? What will happen to all the hopeless and helpless women and children who are forced out of their homes and have nowhere to go? I have had quite a lot to do with these women's refuges. We furnish them, we put in the beds and the blankets and the pots and the pans. We put in voluntarily the support services which give the women and children some hope for the future. With one stroke of the pen the Government has probably taken all that away. It is not a health scheme the Government set up yesterday. The Government is going to create absolute despair throughout a section of the community that is unable to care for itself. The Government was elected to care for the people of Australia. It has failed miserably in that job.

         —Tonight I wish to raise the question of future public access to Garden Island in Cockburn Sound, just south of the Western Australian port of Fremantle. Garden Island is the site of HMAS Stirling, the naval support facility. My complaint is not with the establishment of the facility or its continued existence. On the contrary, HMAS Stirling is a welcome and most necessary naval presence on the west coast. In fact, my hope is that the operation of the facility will be properly fulfilled and, over time, expanded. However, my concern is that the existence of HMAS Stirling is being used by the authorities to restrict severely public access to Garden Island. Such restrictions, in my view, are unnecessary for the operation of HMAS Stirling in peacetime and are excessive with respect to the free movement of the public.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        For many years Garden Island has been an extremely popular recreational and holiday spot. With the advent of HMAS Stirling, the little permanent settlement of cottages and shops at the southern end of the island was demolished. This was necessary and readily understood by all who welcomed the construction of the naval facility. Equally understood was the fencing off of the facility perimeter and the restriction of access to the enclosed property. Effectively, the island was divided in half. The southern end became the preserve of the Navy, but the northern end remained the unspoilt recreational environment of the holiday residents of the 65 cottages left on the island and countless other day trippers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now, however, all cottage owners have received notices to quit. Public access to the island is to be restricted to daylight hours. It has been stated that these notices to quit are being given in the interests of safety due to the fact that an armament depot, located towards the northern end of the island, is expected to be completed by October of this year and that the nature and location of the cottages would make them susceptible to severe damage should an accidental explosion occur. As I recall, there are residences as close to the armament depot on the mainland as the cottages are to the new depot on Garden Island. Additionally, accidental explosions, at this type of depot are so rare that I know of many Garden Island holiday residents who would be happy to sign away rights to claim against the Commonwealth should any such explosion occur and damage or injury result. Further, as I have mentioned, public access will be permitted only during daylight hours.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given this fact one can ask whether the Navy is confident that accidental explosions will occur only during the night. Restricted access to Garden Island has also been justified on the basis of security. To my knowledge, fences and signs have been or are being erected to seal off the restricted area around the armament depot. This provision is more than adequate, with respect to the long-standing holiday residents who have no interest in, or inquisitiveness to interfere with, Navy property. In fact, the eviction of the holiday residents could will lessen security. It is likely that any vandalism and/or criminal theft will originate from day trippers. Holiday residents already exercise an influence over day trippers who may disturb the environment of the island. Equally, such a restraining influence could extend to encouraging respect for Navy property. The disciplinary presence of the residents, will, of course, be lost after their eviction. Such presence would certainly need to be replaced by more than the single ranger who is currently on the island.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is completely understandable that access to HMAS Stirling should be restricted, but I fail to appreciate why such restricted access should be extended to the entire island, involving the eviction of the remaining holiday residents and the limiting of access to the general public. I have invited the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) to visit the island. I am certain that if he does so he will come to the same conclusion to which I have come, that is that the extra restriction on public access to Garden Island is presently both unnecessary and unjustified.

         —As I said earlier, a former journalist with such a unique record is hardly the sort of person to be lecturing this House about journalism or journalists. I return to the substance of the speech of the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) last night. Senator Button did not impugn the integrity of working journalists, as the honourable member for Macarthur claims. He was merely pointing to the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has been manipulating journalists. The Prime Minister wields great power. He can manipulate even the most senior journalists. He finds it easier to manipulate their editors. The Prime Minister is putting journalists under pressure. He has not given a full Press conference since 1976. In 1980 the only Press conference he gave was on Afghanistan. The Prime Minister avoids fully fledged Press conferences because he does not have the answers. By distancing himself from the Press and thus from the people, he puts intolerable pressure on journalists. If they can get a private briefing they will grab it. I would like to see the heavies in the Press Gallery get up early in the morning and door-stop the Prime Minister outside Parliament instead of leaving it to the afternoon papers and the radio and television journalists who have space or time in their pages and programs only for brief simplistic comments which the Prime Minister is good at.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Senator Button made a very good point. It is about time the Parliament and members of the Press Gallery themselves owned up to the extent of this deliberate manipulation of the Press. Certainly they do not need a lecture from this ex-journalist who is marked down by the Sydney Morning Herald as 'never to be employed again'. Indeed, there has always been some doubt about his right to sit in this House and lecture anybody about anything.

         —Only last night the honourable member for Macarthur was speaking-I believe with a forked tongue-on Nationwide, berating one of the leading television journalists, Richard Carleton. It seems rather ironic to me that he was accusing Carleton of 'passive proselytising'. That is a posh way of saying that he did not like the questions. Carleton was bluntly questioning a bunch of identikit backbenchers. I say identikit, although there was one exception-the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey), who, I thought, answered Carleton's questions rather candidly. The rest of those obedient Liberals sat there quietly while the honourable member for Macarthur bucketed Carleton.

Sadly, the honourable member has all the qualities-I must pay tribute to him here-necessary to be on the front bench of the morally bankrupt and decadent Fraser Government, this collection of private sector failures. These are the qualities of the honourable member who had the insolence to attack so wrongly an honourable senator in this House last night.

I hope that it manages to do better next time. The matter I want to raise is an article written, curiously enough, by a journalist in a local paper, the Shoalhaven and Nowra News, in my electorate. The article is headed: 'Confidential report'. The sub-heading reads: 'Nuclear station at Jervis Bay?' The article states:
        </para>

       <para>
        A nuclear power station may still be constructed at Murray's Beach on the shores of Jervis Bay.

       <para>
        This is based on a report leaked by the Federal Opposition claiming that a nuclear power industry was to be established in Australia and that uranium enrichment would proceed. I simply want to say that there is no truth whatsoever in this report that Murray's Beach may still have a nuclear power station. There is no intention whatsoever to proceed with the Jervis Bay project, which was abandoned about 10 years ago. This is a mischievous article. When I deal with journalists, I deal with specific matters that they raise specifically and I say specifically that this is a mischievous article because there is not a scintilla of truth and there is no basis or backing to the allegation contained in the headline. In fact it was clearly stated, I think, by the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) that this would not be on.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article was based on an interdepartmental committee report which stated:

       <para>
        If Australia were to proceed with the establishment of conversion/enrichment or nuclear power generation facilities, it would be necessary to provide a legal basis for regulating the siting, construction, operation and decommissioning of those facilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, it was based on an interdepartmental committee report to the Government regarding the concern of a State government about the far-reaching powers of the Atomic Energy Act as amended last year. That is the reason why the interdepartmental committee met. It has nothing to do with any proposition that there should be a nuclear power station at Jervis Bay. That is arrant nonsense.

       (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the West Australian of 18 July 1979, page 37, that London Metropolitan Police reduced its telephone bill by $985,000, or about 20 per cent, by use of a monitoring device which recorded length, time and destination of telephone calls and the extension from which the call was made.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Are personal telephone calls, particularly trunk and subscriber trunk dialling calls, made by staff of his department controlled; if so, in what way.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Has any consideration been given to the introduction of monitoring devices for telephone calls in his department; if so, what was the outcome of the consideration.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The implications of the report were not considered relevant to my portfolio at the time in view of various steps taken by my department to minimise the illicit use of departmental telephones.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) A departmental standing instruction serves to proscribe the use of departmental telephones for private purposes except in circumstances of extreme urgency. Further:
      </para>
      <para>
       official overseas calls must first be approved by a Second Division officer;
      </para>
      <para>
       official trunk calls (within Australia) must be approved by a Section Head of Class 8 level or above; and
      </para>
      <para>
       private trunk calls must be approved in writing by the Executive Officer, General Services of the Management Services Branch of the department.
      </para>
      <para>
       These instructions are reproduced in the departmental telephone directory.
      </para>
      <para>
       STD bars have been applied to those telephones where officers do not have regular and valid justification for the use of STD facilities or where an officer's supervisor feels that a potential for abuse of those facilities exists.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No detailed consideration has been given to the introduction of monitoring devices since:
      </para>
      <para>
       there is no evidence that the degree of misuse of departmental telephone facilities is such that the installation of a device such as Telecom's PETRA, coupled with the devotion of the considerable resources necessary for the meaningful analyses of monitored data would contribute a cost-effective exercise;
      </para>
      <para>
       the other steps taken to minimise misuse of departmental telephones as detailed in my response to the second part of the honourable member's question appears largely to be effective.

      <para>
       (1) and (2) Details of the public broadcasting stations in operation on 30 August 1980 are listed below in Table A.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3), (4) and (5) There is no direct Federal funding available for public broadcasting. However, limited funds are provided to public broadcasting groups through the Creative Development Branch of the Australian Film Commission (AFC), and from the Special Broadcasting Services (SBS).
      </para>
      <para>
       SBS funds are available as subsidies to public broadcasting stations providing ethnic programs, while AFC funds are available as 'seeding' or establishment grants for the purchase of studio or transmitter equipment.
      </para>
      <para>
       Funds have been made available to assist public broadcasters since 1975 when grants were made by the Film, Radio and Television Board of the Australia Council. The Board was abolished in 1976 and its activities, including that of funding public broadcasting, transferred to the AFC.
      </para>
      <para>
       Details of funds made available by the AFC and the SBS are set out below in Tables B and C respectively.

      <para>
       The Government has maintained policies to set appropriate conditions for resource development in Australia. We have been responsible for developing special mechanisms to allow the States to fund infrastructure projects vital to State economies including meeting the needs of concentrated development in a geographic area such as Gladstone.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Queensland Government of course has responsibilities for the allocation of infrastructure funds on a geographic basis within the State. The broad conclusion of a recent study concluded by my Department is that national benefits of proposed investments in the resources area will only be fully realised if adequate infrastructure is in place. It is relevant however that in many cases individual developers entered into agreements with the Queensland Government to provide infrastructure at their own expense or to jointly finance with local and State authorities the necessary infrastructure developments.
      </para>
      <para>
       Gladstone has some $350 million of infrastructure of various types planned apart from electricity generation and this level of development is on top of the several billion dollars of private investment to be undertaken in and around Gladstone. A comparison of the last two schedules of Major Mining and Manufacturing Investment Projects prepared by my Department shows that no developers of private projects reported delays in the timing of projects for the Gladstone area due to infrastructure constraints.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) The honourable member's attention is drawn to the statement contained in the introduction to the Industry and Commerce Department publication to which he has referred. This explains that the Schedule provides a tabulated list of major investment projects which are currently proceeding or which may proceed in the future. As such the Schedule is an initial collection of development information derived from company and government sources. The Schedule does not, and is not intended to provide precise forecasts of capital expenditure by category of investment over any time period but it does offer at a point in time a snapshot of the direction and magnitude investment is taking in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) See (a) above. My Department in conjunction with other departments is continuing to evaluate the varying data obtained through the surveys with a view to analysing and adjusting the information to take account of such factors as world market conditions, overlapping of projects, etc. and other factors which are known or likely to occur. In this way assessments can be made of the magnitude impact and timing of major project investment to assist in policy formulation and decision making by the Commonwealth Government.

Replacement ballot papers may be issued personally to an elector at any time up to the close of the poll but would not be despatched by post where the request was received after 6 p.m. on the day preceding polling day since the ballot paper could not in those circumstances reach the elector in time for completion before the close of polling.

       (4) The Commonwealth Government has already made a substantial contribution towards the development of Games facilities through the provision of a once and for all $10.0 million interest free non-repayable grant to the Queensland Government for the purpose of constructing sporting facilities and athletes/officials accommodation. This grant is payable on the basis of $2.5 million per year from 1978-79 to 1981-82 inclusive.
      </para>
      <para>
       Given the terms of the $10.0 million grant, the provision of additional Commonwealth Government funding for additional Games facilities has, until recently, not been possible. However, the Government has announced recently the introduction of an International Standard Sports Facilities (ISSF) Program to provide $25 million over 3 years on a dollar for dollar funding basis with the States. The Commonwealth Government has offered the Queensland Government $260,000 for the upgrading of one Games' facility, the Belmont Rifle Range, under this Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       I understand that the Queensland Government is presently considering the installation of lighting at a number of venues (including the QEII Stadium) to be used for the Games. Should the Queensland Government wish to raise the matter in the context of the International Standard Sports Facilities Program, it would be given close consideration by the Commonwealth.

       In July 1980 the Minister for Science and the Environment announced the Government's intention to appoint a committee to monitor the research with, and applications of, the recombinant DNA technique. One of the committee's main tasks will be to advise on the need or otherwise for industrial guidelines. This committee will have no legislative or regulatory power and will primarily operate by consultation with relevant interests and where necessary by liaison with existing regulatory agencies (e.g. quarantine authorities).
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes. CSIRO is being kept informed about developments in the United States of America in a number of ways. CSIRO scientists have visited the United States, worked in US laboratories and attended scientific meetings when reports on US research have been presented. CSIRO also receives copies of all the working papers of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee and other Committees of the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institute of Health, and the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare. CSIRO recently received a visit from the Vice President, Cetus Corporation, the first research company set up to utilize recombinant DNA techniques for the development of commercial processes with genetically manipulated micro-organisms. Last year, Professor Paul Berg, Wilson Professor of Biochemistry at Stanford University Medical Centre, and Nobel Prize winner for his work in genetic engineering, presented the Ninth David Rivett Memorial Lecture in Melbourne. The title of the Lecture was 'Molecular Cloning of Genetic Elements: Implication for Basic and Medical Research'. Professor Berg also visited a number of CSIRO Divisions and other research establishments in Australia.

       The grant is intended to assist eligible people who have contracted to buy or build their first home and obtained the necessary finance to complete. As the grant varies according to accrued savings in each case, and is related to eligibility at the contract date including approved finance, no entitlement can lawfully arise or be calculated in advance of an approved application.

       (b) The Government recently increased the grant payable by introduction of a Family Bonus of up to $1000.
