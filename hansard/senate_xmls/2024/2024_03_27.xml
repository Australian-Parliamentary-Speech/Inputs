                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:02</span>):  The Greens' Competition and Consumer Amendment (Divestiture Powers) Bill would, if passed, give the courts and competition regulators the power, where misuse of market power has occurred, to break up firms across the Australian economy. This would include firms in the banking sector, the energy sector and a range of other sectors including the supermarket sector. If passed, this bill would establish a framework whereby a company that is found to have misused its market power to inflate prices, to exploit supply chains or to keep out competition could be required to reduce their market power or share of the market by divesting assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's economic frameworks have delivered a range of undesirable consequences. They are failing the Australian people. They are part of a global economic framework that is cooking the planet and rendering this planet incapable of supporting human life by breaking down our climate and destroying the ecological processes that sustain human life. They are also impacting significantly on humanity in other ways. In Australia, our economy is increasingly dominated by massive corporations that ruthlessly use their high and growing share of market power to price gouge everyday Australians while raking in billions of dollars in profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Folks will be familiar with the Greens making these arguments, but let's have a look at some of the other people who have made arguments that support this proposition. At Senate estimates earlier this year, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ms Bullock, agreed with the proposition that some corporations are using a lack of competition and the cover of high inflation to increase prices above what would be required in order to meet increases in their input costs. That is an accepted definition of price gouging. Corporations raising their prices above and beyond what they have to to meet increases in their input costs is the very definition of price gouging. We have introduced this bill because we have listened to people through our communities who are struggling to afford essential products and services. Every day that this parliament fails to rein in the power of big corporations who are price gouging, more and more people get left behind. They have to skip meals; they fall behind on their rent; they fall behind on their mortgage payments; they delay vital medical appointments; they are unable to pay their power bills or their school levies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course firms are price gouging across the economy, including in sectors like banking and airlines, but nowhere is this issue more stark and more impactful than in the supermarket sector. The duopoly of Coles and Woolworths holds a massive two-thirds share of the market, making Australia's supermarket sector one of the most concentrated in the world. In response to people struggling to afford essential food and groceries while Coles and Woolworths record billion-dollar profits, the Greens and, ultimately, this Senate initiated an inquiry, through the Select Committee on Supermarket Prices, into the price impact practices of the supermarket duopoly last year. We've heard from people, through that inquiry across the country, having to make impossible choices as exorbitant food and grocery prices force them to skip meals, go without healthy food and make impossible choices between paying their rent or mortgage and feeding their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge Senator Cadell, who has been an active member of that inquiry; Senator Sterle, who's also in the chamber; and all of the other senators who are working cooperatively through the inquiry. We've heard, for example, from a Tasmanian, Danny Carney, whom I know all members of the inquiry will recall because he choked up in our hearings in Hobart as he spoke about his mum, who recently retired after a long career as an aged-care worker, and explained to the committee how, to get through retirement, she has calculated, after that long career as an aged-care worker, that she can only afford to eat twice a day. We also heard from university student Owen Gregory, who said that grocery prices are so high he can only afford to buy half the amount of groceries that he could five years ago. He told the committee that he and his friends can only afford to eat healthy food because they rescue discarded produce from supermarket bins. Along with evidence about the squeezing of consumers, we've had evidence of the supermarket duopoly using their market power to mercilessly pressure farmers and to exploit their workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consumers, farmers, and workers are at breaking point. They need this parliament to take action. Across the board, witnesses to the inquiry called loudly and clearly for the introduction of divestiture powers to break up the supermarket duopoly. It is clear that we need these powers and it is clear that we need these powers now. That's why the Greens have introduced this legislation. We hope that, across the parliament, parties, senators and MPs will listen to everyday families. We hope they will listen to farmers, we hope they will listen to workers and we hope they will support our bill to put divestiture of powers into law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Prime Minister was asked a few weeks ago about divestiture powers, he dismissed the idea as Soviet Union-style policy. Well, that well-known command and control economy, the United States of America, has had divestiture powers since the 1890s. The Prime Minister should make himself aware of that fact. He also should make himself aware of the fact that Ms Cass Gottlieb, the Chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, has agreed in Senate estimates that, if divestiture powers were introduced, they could increase competition in the supermarket sector and that, under economic analysis, this would bring down the cost of food and groceries in Australia. The Prime Minister also should educate himself about the recent report from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, led by Professor Allan Fels, that recommended that Australia should introduce a divestiture law to allow big businesses to be broken up if they misuse market powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Divestiture laws are not a radical or controversial idea. Along with the US, the UK has divestiture powers—interestingly, introduced by Margaret Thatcher. The competition agencies of Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands have all recently used divestiture powers to require the divestment of supermarket assets in their countries in order to increase local competition in the supermarket sector and put downward pressure on food and grocery prices. So it's looking very much like Labor under Mr Albanese is out on a limb, backing in the billion-dollar profits of massive supermarket corporations over and above the interests of millions of Australians who are struggling to put food on the table.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would that be? Perhaps it's because Labor has accepted over half a million dollars over the last decade from Coles and Woolworths, not to mention the massive donations they get from fossil fuel corporations, big banks and the finance industry. In fact, in total, Labor has taken over $100 million from big corporations in the last decade. It's no wonder Labor is running interference for big business and for big corporations. They've trousered over $100 million in the last decade. That investment from the big corporations, from big business in Australia, is paying off in spades, because you've now got a situation where Labor is going to dig in and refuse to allow divestiture laws in this country because they want to protect the price gouging and the profiteering of big corporations. Make no mistake, price gouging, profiteering and concentrating market power is right at the top of the business model for big corporations. It's how they work. They want concentration of market power because it allows them to keep wages low, do over their suppliers and price gouge their customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Massive corporations are motivated by growing their profit above all else, and they definitely don't give their money away for free, but they do give away a lot of their money to the Australian Labor Party, and those donations buy them influence with key decision-makers in the government. There's also a revolving door between the Prime Minister's office and the supermarket corporations. We learned last week that the Prime Minister's former chief of staff has been hired by Woolworths to guide them through the public scrutiny that they are currently facing. Political donations, the revolving door—it's a time-honoured story in Australian politics. Here we go again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a fork-in-the-road moment for the Labor Party. They've got a choice: are they going to keep backing the big corporations, who are ruthlessly using their market power to do over their suppliers, their workers and their customers, or are they going to stand with millions of Australians who are struggling to put food on the table? When the BCA, the Business Council of Australia, came out this week and said that the sky would fall in if we introduced divestiture powers, no-one was surprised by that. Of course they're going to fight for Coles and Woolworths to retain their market share, because both parts of that duopoly are members of the BCA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for this parliament to pass divestiture laws. It's time for this parliament to prioritise the needs of Australians over corporate profits. It's time for the Labor Party to stop standing in the way of divestiture powers in this country. Divestiture powers exist in most so-called free-market economies around the world. They are a standard part of the toolkit of competition regulators and courts in the UK, the US and many other countries. Until we have divestiture powers, mark my words, big corporations will continue to gouge prices, big corporations will continue to ruthlessly use their market dominance to do over farmers and suppliers, and they will continue to put the squeeze on their workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the many people in Australia who are struggling to make ends meet right now and struggling to be able to afford healthy food: know that, if you are having to skip meals, if you're living off two-minute noodles and corn chips and buying less fruit and veg, and if you're having to decide between feeding your family and paying the rent, there is a solution, but know that the solution is not proceeding because the Labor Party has decided to side with big corporations over the interests of ordinary Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Labor Party would support this bill, it would pass through this parliament; there is no doubt about that. If Labor supported this bill or introduced its own bill to create divestiture powers, it would pass through the parliament. This legislation is a minimalist model. It would require a firm to misuse its market powers before a court could grant a divestiture order. That is a very high and established threshold. The reason Labor's not going to go for this bill is not that the threshold is wrong or the way the bill is drafted. It is simply that the Australian Labor Party is making a political choice to side with their corporate donors Coles and Woolworths—to side with the supermarket duopoly in Australia. In doing so, it abandons ordinary Australians and farmers to their fates and abandons workers to be exploited, because there is simply not enough competition in the supermarket sector. The Greens commend this legislation to the Senate. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e68" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:17</span>):  I look forward to making my contribution to Senator McKim's private senator's bill, the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Divestiture Powers) Bill 2024. I want to thank Senator McKim for giving us the opportunity to set up the inquiry. There are a lot of things going on, as people know, and I'm enjoying working alongside Senator McKim. I might not agree with everything he's just said, but it has opened up avenues to the public that—and I'm not trying to be a smarty—I'm well aware of after almost 19 years on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to go a little bit further into what's going on out there. It's a well-known fact—and I'm in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> many times, given my trucking background, having a crack at Coles and Woolies—that they treat the road transport industry as free storage while our truckies, particularly interstaters, sit in queues for two, three, four or five hours waiting to get unloaded. So, no, there's no argument there. The inquiry has done, I think, about three hearings now—we've been in Orange and Hobart, and we did one in Melbourne—and Senator McKim touched on the fact that we've still got a fair bit of work to do. When there is an inquiry going on into supermarket pricing, the first thing I hear when I talk to West Aussies—and I know it myself—is that, when you walk out of Coles and Woolies with two bags and there's 150 bucks gone, it doesn't take long to think, 'Where the hell did that go?' I'll be the first one to say there have been supply chain squeezes and challenges. We know that. But we know some of the products in these supermarkets—and I will say this: with the greatest of respect, $35 for a cut of meat, and it's not a good cut of meat. Crikey! There's some pretty expensive stuff. We've seen fruit and veggies go up and down, and we've heard all sorts of supply-chain reasons why, such as floods. I get all that; it happens every year. Coming from WA and running trucks going through the north, I know we have these challenges. And we know we have invasive pests. We've got to worry about all this sort of stuff; I've got all that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the committee has seen is not an eye-opener to me. I'm pretty sure it'd be an eye-opener to a few other people. But I've been clearly saying this: where I live in Western Australia, down Fremantle way, there are many choices within my area. I have a Coles, a Woolies, three IGAs and an Aldi, so we have choice. I know the argument comes out that there's no choice and no competition. I can't speak for the eastern states, although I know that at my little patch here in Kingston, where I live when I'm in Canberra, I can go to Coles or Supabarn. I've got to tell you that the private marketeer Supabarn has a very nice shop. I say this, and I will stand to be corrected: on a lot of the items on the shelves—we know these supermarkets stock up to 6,000 items—there is competition for us that live in the cities and in the suburbs but not so much for those in the regions or rurally; I get that. We have that choice. I'll go back to my patch, where I can go to Aldi, Woolworths, Coles or the three IGAs. The competition is there. We've got to think about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go back to what we've uncovered, which has been no surprise to us on the rural and regional affairs committee. As Coles and Woolies get battered and bombarded, what has come out of this is the issue for farmers in the horticultural and agricultural industries, and for those working in the fishing industry. It's a well-known fact in this nation that 70 per cent of our seafood is exported—we all know that—and 70 per cent is imported. We know that. We know it's the same for fresh fruit, but I can't remember the exact figures. What's happening here is that every single sector of the agriculture industry feels that they're getting absolutely squeezed. They've come up, but a lot of them won't say it; they rely on the likes of their farming organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear all the stories, and Senator McKim mentioned one of them. Whether they're growing cherries, cucumbers or lettuce—it doesn't matter what it is—they say they are getting belted around by Coles. They are price takers—we know that—like the trucking industry. The growers are at the bottom of the supply chain when it comes to dollars. They have products that have use-by dates, so it's not as though they can put them in cold storage for six months and then wheel them out. They get the living daylights screwed out of them by the supermarkets. I'm not running a protection racket for Aldi or Costco, IGA or anything else; I reckon they're all the same. That's the evidence we've been taking. We all say, 'Oh, those poor farmers,' and we absolutely mean that. We've heard farmers say that, if a carrot has two prongs, it goes into the bin. It's good quality food. There's nothing wrong with it, but it won't make it to the supermarket shelves. If a cucumber has a little kink or an elbow, it goes to the bin. We've got a cost-of-living problem here, and we are seeing all of this food being thrown out; you hear about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was leading the charge on the questioning—I know it wasn't just me—and my favourite line was, 'Do you get cost recovery?' There weren't many that stood up and said they got cost recovery. I think there were only one or two that were still supplying Coles or Woolies, and they were vocal. The rest—I won't use my normal language here—were frightened of opening their mouths. They'd been absolutely terrorised. It's not obvious, but what we've heard is that they'll get pushed to the back of the queue or the big supermarkets won't buy from them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want everyone out there to think about this, because there is a belief that supermarket prices will tumble if we have an inquiry. We know that is not going to happen. We absolutely believe in competition on this side, and we believe that competition is the best thing that could happen. We don't agree with the divestiture of powers—and Senator McKim has heard me say this—because I've done extensive work in America with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. They have divestiture. They have six or seven big brands, and they've got that guerrilla Walmart. I have to tell you, and I'm going to look to you for your support here, Senator Farrell: these monsters and guerrillas—the supermarket chains in America—are not great employers. They are not fantastic supporters of their employees. Am I right, Senator Farrell? He's quietly trying to nod. I'll tell you: they're not. So we look at Coles and we look at Woolies. There are 150,000 people employed there. But we're going down this track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what I believe we should be saying: 'Crikey! Our farmers, food producers and processors need to be able to get cost recovery.' I don't think anyone in Australia would ever expect anyone to work under—well, there may be some people; I have some arguments in here with the opposite side. Everyone should be able to get cost recovery. Think about this: what we should be saying is that we've got to get the prices up for the farmers and the food producers. Whether they come out of the profits of Woolies, Coles, IGA or anyone else, is neither here nor there, although that's where they should come from if the profits are that large. Now, help me out, everyone. While we're out there battering Coles and Woolies—we're not talking about IGA, Costco or Aldi, but we know they're dearer than Coles and Woolies—I don't know where this one's going to end up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would challenge anyone in this place to tell me that the National Farmers Federation—and this'll raise a few eyebrows—have done the right thing by protecting their members. The National Farmers Federation came to our inquiry. They are the be all and end all of the farming and agricultural industry, and how they love their members! They are the same people who joined hands with the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, COSBOA, the Australian Industry Group—and those poor, struggling miners. I forgot about the Minerals Council of Australia. The National Farmers Federation hooked arms with them and put members' money into a $24 million campaign to thwart transport reform in this nation. I've know because I've been on this journey for a long time. I've always said to the farmers: 'You should stand up like we're doing with the transport industry. Stand up and get paid properly. Get cost recovery. Be viable, be safe, be sustainable and, God help us, you might get a little bit of profit.' So the National Farmers Federation, for me, hold absolutely not one skerrick of decency about them. They come to our meetings and talk about the poor farmers. When I ask them, 'Why did you think it was a good idea to throw money at stopping transport reform?' they have nothing to say. I know there'll be a flurry of letters coming to say they want to meet with me. I don't want to meet with the National Farmers Federation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are saying very clearly is that every horticulture and agriculture industry in this nation is struggling financially. I look across, and there are some really good people on that side of the building who come in here with dirt under their fingernails.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  I'm looking at Senator Cadell. There he is. There you go. They come here with dirt under their fingernails and actually know that this is not the real world in here. The real world is outside.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got this conundrum where there is an expectation that somehow a Senate inquiry will bring down prices, but the Senate inquiry is bombarded with the opposite effect: that people have got to start getting paid. We hear day in and day out about family farmers walking off the land. Correct me if I'm wrong, Senator Cadell. It's no different from our trucking industry. There are three- and four-generation trucking families just shutting shop. Think about that. We've heard of three and four generations, with the great-grandfather, grandfather, father and son, and the next generation is saying, 'Don't want it.' And then we start talking about food security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, with the greatest of respect to my colleague Senator McKim, for whom and for whose work I have huge respect, I cannot agree that divestiture will sort this out. If you marry up the argument I'm putting together with what we see in America and the UK, we know that these are not fantastic employers. It's bad enough that our farmers are getting the living daylights financially screwed out of them, but, when we go to those other corporate guerrillas like Aldi and Costco—don't leave them out—that's how they operate. Not only will they screw their workers down but profits are the biggest thing. I really struggle to see where we're going to go with this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also know we've got former minister Craig Emerson heading up his inquiry. We've had the ACCC. We know something has to be done. What is that magic bullet? I'm looking for it. I hope it comes out. What we really want to know is: do the corporates like Coles and Woolies make that much of a profit that they can actually do the right thing and pass that profit back down the chain to the suppliers? I'd like to think that is the case. I don't know. We'll be asking Coles and Woolies that. But what if Coles and Woolworths come out and their profit isn't that huge? What conundrum does that lead us to while we're screaming about looking after our suppliers, our horticulture and agriculture industry. That ain't going to bring prices down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without being the bearer of bad news: it's not new to those of us on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. I sincerely stand here saying with my hand on my heart that I've been out there supporting the agriculture industry for nearly 19 years in this building and I'll continue to do it, but, by crikey, they need help, and the National Farmers Federation ain't the answer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hopefully, the state organisations will be able to do something, but they should take a leaf out of the road transport industry's book. The agriculture industry will say, 'Oh, we're diverse.' Yes, they are. There are many, many cogs to their wheel. So is the road transport industry. The road transport industry has 47 sectors. Think about that. I can name about 12 or 13 before I start getting wobbly and have to really start thinking hard. So we're not much different than the agriculture industry, but the road transport industry got its act together. The road transport industry united around this nation to say that enough was enough. Think about everything that gets onto the shelves: our meat, eggs, dairy, fresh fruit and vegies. They don't get there on the back of a horse; they get there on the back of a truck.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The road transport industry and the agriculture industry are intertwined with each other. The road transport industry starts off everything for the agriculture industry. We bring in the seed, the fuel, the machines and the fertiliser. The farmers do what they do fantastically and then we get there, the low loader or the tipper is gone and now it's on the back of a tautliner or a fridge. We are intertwined. If the road transport industry could get its act together to stand up and say, 'Enough is enough,' this is what the farming industry needs to do. And they need to find a new guru, because it ain't the NFF. To those who blindly think the NFF speaks for the farming industry, I'll throw the challenge out: the NFF have got no cred. They can't come into any inquiry and start crying and moaning about their members getting screwed down while they're supposed to be the gurus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly hope that puts another angle on the argument. I, for one, believe the prices that we're being charged in the supermarkets are horrific. There is no argument about that. How do we fix that? I thought I would throw in another layer of confusion and another layer of challenges. At the end of the day, Senator McKim, you are definitely right on one thing. The guerrillas are making money: let's make no mistake about that. How much money they're making is what I would love to know, but I just don't want to leave any queries out there. We've got some big problems in this nation, and it's very, very easy for people, when they're getting screwed down, to want to screw down other industries. This is what I've heard all the way along: 'We're not making money, so you can't make money.' No, no, no. Flip that around and start thinking about it. With productivity in this nation, we can bring prices down, I can tell you, and it starts with the road transport industry.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300134" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CADELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:32</span>):  I don't think Senator Sterle in that last speech made things more complicated at all; I think he made it easy. In terms of his reference to the issues the road transport industry had and bringing legislation into this place to fix it, this is exactly what Senator McKim seeks to do now. I think it has become crystal clear. We can all stand up and talk about the problems we hear on this committee. We can hear about the farmers and about the consumer costs, but it takes someone to come up with an answer, and that is what this bill is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Competition and Consumer Amendment (Divestiture Powers) Bill 2024 comes in with a big answer that can be a big stick to these people when they do it wrong. It's not the whim of a person. It's not because we feel like doing something today. The provisions only apply with a court appeal relating to abuse of market power or unconscionable conduct. What sort of business would be fearful of being held to account under those provisions? They are activating everyone they can to come out and say: 'No, this is horrible. This is the worst thing in the world.' The supermarkets are out there. They've got BCA, and they've got all these people out there. That's because they are fearful that they are partaking in this unconscionable conduct and abuse of market power; otherwise they wouldn't fear it so much. I notice Bran Black from the BCA said, 'The short point is the powers are an impediment to businesses growing. When the businesses don't grow, they don't hire staff.' Let me tell you, with these businesses having 67 per cent of the market share, we don't want them to grow. That is the point! Bran has got it: you have too much power. And this bill—I know the Greens don't like nuclear—is the nuclear button for when they go too far.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There'll be other things. There are other things we can do. This committee is great at looking at them. We're hearing from them; we're getting into it. But this needs to be there in supermarkets, and I would say this broad power is good enough anyway. We have an air industry where 90 per cent is controlled by two big operators. Believe it or not, live plants come under the grocery code, and Bunnings has 70 per cent of the market. If you want abuse of market power, forget the testimony that comes out in our committees. How about the testimony that doesn't come there from the producers and the processors who are too scared to talk? That's because they have two customers who are on the chopping block and they fear that, if they say something, their own businesses will be there. You don't need any evidence other than that. If people are too scared to talk about unconscionable conduct, it is happening and retribution will happen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear about this being the worst thing in the world. I think Senator McKim raised Soviet-style communist power—things like that. There are OECD countries with some form of divestment power and in the United States there are violations under section 2 of the Sherman act. Under the German Competition Act, Germany can do it irrespective of the legal conduct. They can do it on a whim; they have the power, as do France, United Kingdom, Austria, Canada, Estonia, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain. We are one of the few that don't have this power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were talking about Costco. When we hear the numbers on margins from people who are too scared to come in and be sworn as witnesses, we can't rely on these things in our report. We heard from someone who is a controller of a pantry section, an area manager of a supermarket. They said they require a 40 per cent margin in the pantry section. In the fresh food section they have privately told me they want a 100 per cent average mark-up across their firm. They are big margins. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, we threw Costco into the bin. I have a processor who supplies a number of supermarkets and who supplies Costco. They went to Costco with a pricing proposal to make a 25 per cent margin on one of their products and Costco actually said, 'No, we will take 18. We give our customers between 16 and 18 per cent mark-up on this,' because they have a different business model. But that is the mark-up others are having. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note in the ACCC review that he has power to go back and ask for two to three years of data—market share, margins; all these sorts of things—but has asked for five, and the supermarkets will probably give that. Why? It is because they have been increasing their margin for 15 or 20 years and five years of data will not show the picture. They will show five years and say, 'Our margin has only slightly increased.' Go back 15 or 20 and they will show they have been hitting the farmers and hitting the Australian consumers bit by bit by bit. The supermarkets are addicted to increasing their margins, taking the money and screwing over everyone they deal with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has just become visible in the last few years, when the suppliers and the processors can give no more. They're at their wits' end; they have no margins. We have farmers up there shaking. I was in an incident in Bathurst. I'm not proud of what I did up there. I have two guys in pig suits downstairs because I have a farmer upstairs shaking, scared about giving evidence. I have another one talking about 100 years of his farm and him being the last generation and I have another guy who walked off their farm. We have people who want to make stunts, people who want to say things that are identifying the problem but not coming up with a solution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a solution. It is not perfect. No-one here is saying it is perfect. But, to be clear, politicians stand on the fence sometimes. Were a vote to come today, it might be problematic to get this through, but I would stand on that side if this came to a vote today and support it irrespective of what the parties would do. That is why we are here. So when Senator Sterle talks about the way they fixed the trucking industry, this is just the same; it is a legislative fix to a real problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we hear all these stories from a supplier, we can shoot the NFF down as much as we want, but we cannot shoot the New South Wales farmers down. Their engagement is real. When they came to Orange they told horrible stories about real things like trucks being turned around after they delivered their goods because the produce didn't meet a standard—too big, too small, the wrong colour, not straight enough. We hear of consumers in Tasmania dumpster-diving to get a meal because they can't afford things anymore. Once again, when we see this margin in the middle growing and growing over time—the costs getting bigger on one end and the returns getting smaller on the other end—the supermarkets never lose. They're like the casinos of Australian commerce. The supermarkets never lose. I think we start with a bill like this with great powers to reflect great wrongs, and then we get down to the other things that come through in the minutia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about having arbiters for disputes with supermarkets when we go through it. But guess who appoints them? The supermarkets. If I'm fearful to give evidence about what's happening, am I going to go to someone who's appointed by the supermarket and complain about it? Probably not, because I want to be able to sell next week's crop or next month's produce. We need independent arbiters. We need proactive arbiters who go out and do audits so that growers have cover for talking to them and are not punished for talking to them. We need transparency on prices, we need transparency on margins and we need to know historically how they have increased over time while they've been screwing the farmer, screwing the processor and then getting the consumer at the far end. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another amazing example of someone who was too scared to talk related to their olive oil. In 2012 it was $25 on the shelf, and in 2022 it was $25 on the shelf. Today it is, I think, $45 on the shelf, because they've been held down so long they can't get a margin. The word that supermarkets keep coming up with is 'mitigate'. They say: 'Your costs have gone up? Mitigate. Don't look at what the Australian standard is on what Australian fruit and vegetables cost. The Brazilian index on juice has only gone up 17 per cent, but you're asking for a 25 per cent price rise. Mitigate.' What they're saying is: 'Buy overseas. Don't support Australian industry and don't support Australian farmers.' It is a fix. They are addicted to squeezing every cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a great boxing phrase that I learnt once about Don King, the great boxing promoter. 'A true humanitarian,' goes the phrase, 'he only wants the first 26 cents out of every quarter you earn.' That is what the supermarkets are like. They want to get everything out of you. If it's not supplying goods that perish in five days, it's having to supply pallets for 28 days, so the supermarkets don't have to pay pallet hire. With regard to paper bags, back in the day when I used to go up to the Broadmeadow Nine Ways and do some shopping with Mum and Nan, we brought everything home in paper bags. The supermarkets had to start charging for plastic bags because that was an environmental responsibility. Now we've changed back to paper bags but they'll keep charging. In fact they'll charge a little bit more because there's somewhere else they can get you. That is abuse of market power. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side in my party we have not always recognised the threat from when we have gone away from some single desks or trading blocs. I'm not here to defend the legacy when we are wrong, but clearly we threw growers and producers under the wheels of the truck back in the day, and we see the error of that now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If these people are truly scared of having to sell off a Big W or a Liquorland or something like that, because they do the wrong thing, they will act better. If they are scared that their boards will be answerable when they lose these things, they will act better, because it is a true fact that power only likes power and only responds to power. Coles and Woolworths have 66 per cent of the market. We can talk about all the others stores, but they aren't in the same league. And the other guys, to try and compete, have to participate in some of the very same things we hate, just to try and compete with the big guys. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of the talking points of the BCA and of the big businesses on this are wrong. They are trying to protect the status quo, and they are trying to protect the size of businesses that we see as the problem. The only way to get cheaper prices and a better supply chain is to minimise that gap in the middle, minimise those margins and make better practices. It is the only way, because you can't have everything. I can't get my farmers and the people of New South Wales better money for their produce and consumers a better deal unless we squeeze these margins. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill. It is a difficult thing for this side of the chamber, because it is not perfect, but it's as close as we get. I look forward to working on the committee going forward until 7 May, which I think is the reporting date, to potentially work on what we can do to adjust this, adjust other things and put in other mechanisms so that we have something that gets these supermarkets very accountable to the Australian people and very accountable to their growers. I am very pleased to be a part of this. It is probably the most enjoyable and valuing thing I've done since I've come to the chamber. We don't just want to stand up and point out problems; we want to come here with solutions. This is one. Thank you, Senator McKim. I would support this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300639" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator TYRRELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Jacqui Lambie Network Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:45</span>):  I also want to thank Senator McKim and his gorgeous staff that worked hard and long on the Competition and Consumer (Divestiture Powers) Bill 2024. We've all heard the catchphrase, 'Down, down—prices are down,' but the only thing going down is trust in the major supermarkets. Duopolies are bad for the market, believe it or not. Australia's supermarket scene is a case in point of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Select Committee on Supermarket Prices kicked off at the start of this month, and the evidence has been damning. We've seen people shake because of nerves and cry because of fear, all while being thankful that their voices are finally being heard. Successive governments have stood by while the big supermarkets, Woolworths and Coles, indulge in ever-increasing market power. There has been inquiry after inquiry, report after report, yet no-one has come up with anything other than maintaining the status quo. Not this time. Something's going to change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's obvious that it's not just the major supermarkets giving Australians the raw end of the deal; it's also big businesses, like Bunnings, that are leaving hardworking Australians high and dry. Right now, we pretty much have a situation where full-grown adults are bullying kindergarten children. The power imbalance is too skewed, and the supermarkets aren't picking on someone their own size. Under the guise of inflation, the supermarkets have jacked up prices, worsening the cost-of-living crisis for so many Australian families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Hobart, we heard from Louise, a single mother of eight children, who works in child safety and completed a bachelor's degree and honours. Louise said she's often faced with the impossible decision: food or doctor; food or the power bill; food or uniforms for her kids. The cost-of-living crisis isn't just a catchcry; it's a reality. But, precisely at this time, when so many Australian families are doing it tough, the supermarkets should do what they can to help not hinder families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the supermarkets' profits go sky-high, it's also Australian farmers who struggle to make ends meet in a world of increased costs. Some fruit and vegetable growers haven't been given price increases in 15 years. How is that so? The big supermarkets flex their muscles, using tactics to keep their purchase price low while making the customer pay. Farmers pride themselves on feeding their country, but even they are saying farming just isn't the industry to be in anymore. Family farms are going under because kids have seen their parents struggle and they're steering clear of a future in the industry. Parents are actually encouraging their children not to take up farming. They're telling them to go find something better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Between what the farmers get paid and what the consumers pay, there is a big gaping hole and a bucket of cash lining the pockets of the major supermarkets. Because the major supermarkets have a duopoly, it's difficult to find other buyers to take on produce, so farmers feel obliged to enter into contracts with Coles and Woolies. If they don't, who will they sell it to? Farmers are still using the weight of the supermarkets' word as supply agreements. In many instances, there's no written agreement. What contract have you had by text that you can stand by in a court of law? This makes it hard to plan for future investments in the business, stagnating growth and innovation. While people are starving, farmers and community groups tell us that perfectly fine produce is being thrown out. These strict rules are taking quality produce off the shelf and putting it in the garbage bin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This divestiture bill is to pull into line those corporations who use dodgy tactics to exploit others to their own gain. How we got to this point can be blamed on government inaction. They've given Woolworths and Coles a free pass. We are told that they are big employers or that millions of Australians are shareholders. Yes, they are big employers, collectively employing more than 310,000 people. That's more than half of Tasmania's entire population. Yes, there are many Australians who are shareholders, directly or indirectly, through superannuation. And, yes, the size of the business is mammoth, with Coles and Woolworths each bringing in more revenue than the entire GDP of Tasmania. But no business should be able to hide behind the facade of being a big employer to duckshove the standards that the community expects of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tassie we have seen Woolworths and Coles grow too big for their boots. The expansion strategies of the big two supermarkets have been aggressive. There's a Coles or Woolies for every 8,000 people. Tasmanians aren't spoiled for choice on where to shop. The big supermarkets have a hold on the market in Tasmania, and it makes it hard for other players to enter the market. That's why we need these divestiture powers. The supermarkets are dabbling in so many things to cement their market power. Their pricing tactics, purchasing tactics and tactics for acquiring property all reek of attempts to limit competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister said, 'We're not the old Soviet Union,' when ruling out divestiture powers. I wonder if the Prime Minister intended to call the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union offshoots of the Soviet Union? I suspect not. All these countries have divestiture powers and the sky has not fallen in. The reality is this is an entirely sensible approach. All it means is that the ACCC can obtain a court ordered divestiture where an abuse of market power has occurred. It extends the current divestiture power that can be obtained only where a breach of merger laws has occurred. This will not affect corporations that do the right thing. Placing checks and balances on our free market isn't something to be afraid of. That's why I'll be supporting this bill. It's obvious that Woolworths and Coles have gone unchecked for too long. It's time for them to have a reality check.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator RICE:</span>
                    </a>  The sentiment of 'stop the poverty machine' is what I want to focus on. Poverty exists in our society today. People are suffering from inadequate income support and from the price gouging of the major supermarkets. We have a huge problem here in Australia; people are literally starving. Where people cannot afford to eat, they are choosing, on a daily basis, whether they are eating, paying their rent or paying for their medications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill that we are talking about today is part of the solution to address this problem, to improve life for ordinary Australians. What I want to do with my time here today is just share one more story with you about somebody who is just struggling so much. They're an ordinary Australian, one of the many who have written to my office saying, 'This is my reality.' This is from a constituent of mine called Peter. Peter says: 'How are people on income support payments like JobSeeker, people who are expected to live on the meagre rate of $55 a day, supposed to keep up with the current price gouging of these supermarkets?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter forwarded me an email that he had sent to the government about the recent indexation of JobSeeker that Labor had tried to claim as a cost-of-living measure. Peter said: 'Today we know that, due to indexation, JobSeeker and other payments will be increased by about 96c per day. This is hardly adequate. It's better than nothing, but it comes from a very low base. This increase of 96c a day is little more than a loaf of bread per week. Choice found the average cost of a loaf of bread to be $4.45. I will deliberately use food terms, as many on income support are on or below the "breadline". Choice say that a packet of white sliced bread used to cost $3.40 on average but now costs $4.45, the cost of white sliced bread has gone up 41 per cent since 2019, bread from Coles went up 37 per cent on average, bread from Woolworths went up 56 per cent on average and bread from IGA went up 37 per cent on average.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that many are actually skipping meals. Charity after charity report the difficulties of meeting the cost of living. Those on average incomes are struggling. The reports across the community sector are uniform. I was on JobSeeker in the past while waiting to be assessed for the Disability Support Pension. I ate once per day. That meal did not include quality cuts of meat and fresh fruit and vegetables but consisted of eggs, tinned soups or pasta. The maximum rate of JobSeeker for a single person is $762.70 per fortnight. An older Australian aged over 55 years and on support for nine months is entitled to $816.90. These figures include allowances excluding rental allowance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From previous discussions with your office'—this is presumably Minister Rishworth's office—'the Prime Minister's office and relevant ministers' offices, replies typically pointed out that rental assistance is available. I have been told ad nauseam that the Labor government increased it, even though this rental assistance bears absolutely no realistic relationship to rent. One response from a Labor minister mentioned the availability of financial counselling. That reply was condescending and patronising. The problem is that rates of JobSeeker and Youth Allowance are too low. The Department of Families, Fairness and Housing, in its December quarterly report, indicated that rents in Melbourne had increased on average by $15 a week. Ninety-six cents does not even come close to meeting this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee last year recommended real increases, and this was largely ignored. Unemployment and poverty come with other impacts: loss of hobbies, pursuits, social interaction and self-esteem, diminished self-worth and increased physical and mental health problems. Most of our social lives are built around food and drinks. We go out for coffee; we have a beer. These simple pleasures are difficult for our most vulnerable. Again referencing Choice, even instant coffee is hard. The price of instant coffee at Coles and Woolworths has gone up 18 per cent since 2019. Prices have gone up by approximately 79c per hundred grams. That's almost all of one day's indexation rise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People on JobSeeker are not working. They are not doing well now. The amount of JobSeeker is not enough to provide basics. The amount is so low it's likely to negatively prejudice job seeking. If they are ill or hungry, or skipping food or medical care, they'll not do well in an interview or a test. Employers increasingly use a range of tests. There needs to be a substantial increase to all income support payments, and people need real assistance now.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of solutions that have been put forward by the Greens and have a lot of support around this parliament. These divestiture rules are one solution that would stop the price gouging of supermarkets and enable people like Peter to afford to eat just that little bit more. When we couple that with increasing income support to above the poverty line, to above $88 a day, then we'd be in a situation where people like Peter—millions of Australians like him—would actually be able to feel that they've got a future in this country. They would feel that they are supported by this parliament. They would feel that they have the opportunity to get their lives back on track. There are a combination of things we need to be doing, and it is abundantly clear to anybody looking on that what we're doing at the moment is not working. With the price gouging of supermarkets and the absolutely poverty payment rates of income support, people are just suffering. They are more than doing it tough. They are more than struggling. There are people literally starving in Australia today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a wealthy country. It is absolutely unacceptable that we should have such poverty in our country today. There are solutions that we can put on the table and that we could legislate for. One of those is to have divestiture powers so that Coles and Woolworths don't have the power over people that they have at the moment. The other is for this government to play its part and increase income support to above the poverty line to break the poverty machine and make sure that all Australians have the opportunity to live their best lives.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  It's really important and I want to make sure that we get on the record our position on this bill, the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Divestiture Powers) Bill 2024, and on divestiture laws. It is no secret that the Nationals have been calling for divestiture powers for quite some time. My leader, David Littleproud, was calling for it as recently as February. But it is also very important that we get it right, that we don't rush divestiture powers through and that we take the time to ensure they are fit for purpose. Let me make it clear that most like economies around the world have divestment powers in their legislation. They are a mechanism to ensure that big corporations, particularly big corporations that have monopoly-like scenarios, do the right thing and don't misuse their market powers, and that, if they do and if they are found to be misusing them, there is a mechanism in law whereby action can be taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Divestment powers are supported within our economy. In particular, the former ACCC commissioner Allan Fels says granting the watchdog powers to call for the break-up of corporate giants would act as a big stick against anticompetitive behaviour. He makes it clear that the existence of the power is a huge stick that is needed to make sure some parts of the Competition and Consumer Act work more effectively on big business. Section 46 of the act currently prohibits companies with substantial market power from taking advantage of their power by inhibiting rivals. But what we know and what we are increasingly hearing through the Senate committee inquiry into supermarkets is that section 46 is not working. It is not strong enough to ensure that companies with substantial market powers don't inhibit their rivals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are hearing stories of the large corporate supermarkets effectively land banking. They are buying blocks of commercial land to prevent rivals from opening up competing stores.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are hearing stories of supermarkets requiring suppliers, particularly suppliers in fresh food areas like horticulture, to sign exclusivity contracts to provide a set amount of product, but they do not have similar requirements in reverse. So we're hearing stories like those of a supermarket going to a supplier and saying, 'You must supply only us. You can't supply us and your local farmers market. You must supply only us with a product of a set aesthetic, size and quality, and we want, say, 10 tonnes a month.' So the grower goes and plants enough to produce the 10 tonnes a month with enough wiggle room so they all meet the strict quality requirements, but then, at the end of the month, the supermarket says, 'I only need five tonnes, and I'm only going to pay you for five tonnes.' But that supplier can't then go and sell the other five tonnes elsewhere, because of the exclusivity contract, and that's not fair. How is that not taking advantage? How is that not undertaking actions that inhibit rivals?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I agree with Mr Fels when he says that section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act is relatively ineffective and has very minor penalties or fines. Most big businesses don't take too much notice of it. They sort of factor it into their business models. 'If we get a little fine through section 46, so be it. That's just the cost of doing business.' That's not good enough. That is why the Nationals have been calling for big stick legislation. It's why we have grave concerns about the fact that three of the big supermarkets control over 74 per cent of the grocery market. They are the market. They dictate prices, and they put pressure on suppliers. But we're also seeing that, when they dictate the price to the suppliers and the farmers, that doesn't translate to the check-out. When meat prices go down at the marketplace, they don't go down at the check-out. Has anyone gone to buy a lamb cutlet lately? I love lamb. It's my favourite meat.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACCC needs powers to properly investigate as part of a dedicated inquiry. They need the powers to be able to call witnesses and compel witnesses, and they need the powers to recommend harsher penalties. That's what the Nationals have been calling for. We'd like to see increased penalties, scaling up, and we want to see divestiture powers. We want to be able to force supermarkets who do the wrong thing to be forced to sell off a component of their business—for example, forcing Woolworths to get rid of BWS or Coles to get rid of Liquorland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I don't agree with is the current scare campaign by the Business Council of Australia, who are running around saying that, if we introduce divestiture powers, all the regional towns will lose their supermarkets and it will negatively impact on the regions. That's not how we're talking. If we design a proper model for divestiture, which is what the Nationals are working on and what we are currently talking to our opposition counterparts about, it's about designing a model where the ACCC can properly investigate and recommend actions and, where it is found that a market power is not operating in the best interests of suppliers and consumers, an application can be made to a court to enforce divestment. That does not automatically mean that the divestment will occur in a regional area.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other day, I heard the case study of the town of Cooma. A number of years ago, there was only one supermarket brand in that town. There were a couple of supermarkets, but they were both the same brand, and they had bought up a lot of the commercial land to prevent rivals entering that market. In those circumstances, the court could recommend that that brand would have to divest themselves of either one of their supermarkets or the commercial land that they'd bought up to enable a rival and to enable more competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It might be that the recommendation or the action taken by the court is to have divestment of a small business unit within the large business. What it won't be is, 'Get rid of 20 per cent of your stores and we're going to leave it to the market monopoly provider to decide what 20 per cent of those stores are,' which is what the BCA's claims. 'If you tell Coles or Woolies to get rid of 20 per cent of their stores they're only going to close down stores in regional areas.' I don't believe that for a second. That is a scare campaign being conducted by people who don't want to see Australia have a big stick to hold market monopolies to account, like in other similar economies around the world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just yesterday in this chamber we heard Senator Penny Wong talking time and time again about the fuel efficiency standards: 'Why is Australia lagging? Why is Australia the only Western economy not to have fuel efficiency standards? We need to keep up with the rest of the world.' Why doesn't she apply the same thinking to divestment powers? Why is Australia one of the only Western economies not to have divestiture powers for big corporate market operators? </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the parliament has the power to require the production of documents, it has also been acknowledged by the parliament that the government holds some information which, in the public interest, should not be disclosed. In this case, the Attorney-General has made clear that the disclosure of the information requested would, or might reasonably be expected to, disclose information that would be damaging to Australia's national security. This is an accepted ground on which a public interest immunity claim can be made. In fact, I would note that claims of public interest immunity on this ground were repeatedly made by ministers in the former coalition government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General claimed public interest immunity after receiving advice from relevant agencies on the expected impact if the information were to be disclosed. The order requests documents relating to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The position of the government on the IRGC is clear: the IRGC is a malignant actor that has long been a threat to international security. The Gillard government understood this and placed broad-based sanctions on the IRGC as a whole in 2010. The Albanese government has also recognised the threat it presents. That is why we have taken meaningful action, including sanctioning 60 IRGC-linked officials and 55 IRGC-linked entities since September 2022. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I've heard from some of those opposite is a bit rich considering they said nothing and did nothing on Iran during nine long years in government—not one new sanction on Iran. More sanctions have been imposed on Iran by this government than under any previous Australian government. I would also note that listings under the criminal code apply to non-state actors and not to state actors. These are the same listing provisions that applied when those opposite were in government and have not changed. The IRGC is a fully formed part of the Iranian state. State actors cannot be listed as terrorist organisations.</span>

This is the basis upon which the Attorney-General has claimed public interest immunity. That claim stands.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the response just provided by the Minister representing the Attorney-General on the government's refusal to comply with orders of the Senate in relation to documents relating to the terrorist organisation, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, once again we have seen this government completely disrespecting the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's statement has provided absolutely no justification for its assertion that the public interest would be harmed by the release of these documents confidentially to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. That assertion makes absolutely no logical sense. Everybody in this Senate knows that the IRGC is involved in terrorist activity. Everyone in this Senate knows that the government knows it. That is why the documents that we have sought to compel the government to provide were created. How can the confidential disclosure to the parliamentary committee with specific oversight of security and intelligence matters of two documents based on publicly available open source information possibly create a risk to our national interest? Those are the grounds upon which the government has again refused this request today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason the government refuses to release these documents—despite the fact that, as I've said, they have no proper justification for doing so—is that it doesn't want the public to know that its agencies were preparing for the IRGC to be listed before someone in government put a stop to it. The government never admitted of its own volition that the Department of Home Affairs had been highly advanced in preparing a listing of the IRGC in January last year. In fact, when the Attorney-General's Department made a last-minute submission—almost a last-second submission—to the Senate inquiry I chaired, on the night before our report was tabled, that department was in possession of a statement of reasons and a nomination form for the IRGC, but they made absolutely no reference to it in their submission to my committee. Instead they claimed that they had suddenly—in the space of two weeks—formed the view that it wasn't legally possible to list the IRGC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have enough information now, despite the best efforts at secrecy from this government, to have an idea where the direction to shut down the listing of the IRGC came from. During Senate estimates last year, I asked the Attorney-General's Department where the idea to put in a last-minute submission to the Senate inquiry claiming it was impossible to list the IRGC had come from. The answer was, 'We had conversations with the Attorney-General's office.' I asked whether those conversations were initiated by the Attorney-General's office rather than by the department, and department officials confirmed that this was the case. So we know that the government department had prepared documents for the terror listing of the IRGC, and we know that members of the Albanese government's cabinet made sure that that listing was shut down. Every time we have asked a minister since then what they are doing to progress a listing, including drafting any legislative amendments that they believe would be required—something we have offered bipartisan support for—the answer has been that they're not doing anything.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a political decision for secrecy and inaction by the Albanese government. Again today we have a minister coming into the Senate and blatantly refusing to follow an order of this Senate. When it comes to serious national security matters, there is a clear pattern of obstructionist behaviour by the Albanese government. Just look at the story in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> newspaper today in which multiple government insiders admit that the offices of the minsters for immigration and home affairs held tactical meetings about how to avoid answering questions from my colleague Senator Paterson about the criminal records of detainees released into the community by the government. It reveals that, instead of spending their time focusing on the safety of the community, they were holding meetings about how to keep the community in the dark.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We learn today that government ministers were infuriated that their own department secretary answered questions and provided the requested information because it was, according to a government source, 'tactically the wrong thing to do'. That is a disgraceful attitude to public safety by this government, but it is exactly the type of attitude we have become used to over the past couple of years and, indeed, over the 12 months since we've been examining these Iran questions. We are not going to put up with the government refusing to answer questions about why it has done everything it can to stop the IRGC being listed as a terrorist organisation. It is completely unacceptable that this government is refusing to comply with orders of this Senate relating to the IRGC, and we will continue to pursue answers and transparency from this secretive, arrogant government.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:19</span>):  I have spoken on this issue a number of times. I congratulate Senator Chandler for her advocacy in this matter. I want to take issue with two points that were raised by the minister. First, he described the IRGC as a 'malignant actor'. That was the phrase he used in his statement—'malignant actor'. It is a terrorist organisation. The IRGC should be declared a terrorist organisation because it is a terrorist organisation. If there is some legislative impediment then talk to the opposition. We have made our views abundantly clear in this regard and we will cooperate to amend the law if that is what is required to have the IRGC declared a terrorist organisation. Members of the crossbench will also cooperate, I'm sure, because this is an organisation that engages in terrorist operations all over the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It appears we came so close in January 2023 to nominating it as a terrorist organisation. There was even a statement of reasons prepared to nominate it and then nothing—crickets! Nothing. The US has declared it a terrorist organisation. The European Union parliament has almost unanimously called on its member states to declare it a terrorist organisation. But this government describes it as a 'malignant actor'. I wonder who crafted that phrase? It is not a 'malignant actor'; it is a terrorist organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give people listening to this debate some sort of insight into what this organisation does. I am reading from an article here that was written by Matthew Levitt, Wednesday 8 February 2023. It's entitled: 'The EU can and should designate the IRGC is terrorist group'. These are some of the examples he gives:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Beyond Europe, the latest evidence of Iranian terrorist plotting abroad came out last Friday, when senior U.S. officials gathered for a press conference to reveal the indictment and arrest of three criminals charged with the attempted murder-for-hire of an American-Iranian journalist in New York.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what they do. This is a terrorist organisations that targets Iranians dissidents who are shining a bright light on the almost unbelievable human rights abuses that are occurring in Iran.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The three were part of an organized criminal organization based in Eastern Europe with ties to Iran. The leader of the group, who was based in Iran, was enlisted by Iranian agents in 2022 to assassinate the victim in the United States.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In August, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted IRGC personnel behind assassination plots targeting former senior U.S. government officials in the United States, among others. In 2019, two Iranian operatives pleaded guilty to charges stemming from their surveillance activities targeting Iranian dissidents and Jewish targets in the United States.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How is this? More recently, this is what the IRGC, the organisation described as a 'malignant actor', did: they agreed to pay an assassin $300,000 to kill John Bolton, who used to be US representative on United Nations. More recently, the IRGC agreed to pay an assassin $1 million for the assassination of the former secretary of state Mike Pompeo. This is the organisation we are dealing with. The United States has declared it a terrorist organisation. The EU parliament has overwhelmingly called for its member states to declare it a terrorist organisation, not a 'malignant actor'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian-Iranian diaspora is looking to this parliament to take action to declare this terrorist organisation a terrorist organisation, and all we get from the government are mealy-mouthed excuses as to why they can't. Their lack of good faith in this matter is indicated in the fact that they refuse to engage in constructive discussions with the coalition and the crossbench to address any legal impediments that would prevent the IRGC being declared a terrorist organisation. The IRGC should be declared a terrorist organisation because it is a terrorist organisation. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  At the heart of the minister's attendance before the chamber this morning is the issue of accountability and transparency of this government. Before the election, the Prime Minister promised to lead the most transparent and accountable government ever, but, through the actions of this government, we are finding that, in fact, the Prime Minister leads the least transparent and the least accountable government since Federation. Day after day, the Senate asks for documents, the attendance of ministers and for information relating to the expenditure of taxpayers' money and to decisions concerning the safety of Australia and its citizens, and day after day the executive of this country snubs its nose at the Senate and, by snubbing its nose at the Senate, snubs its nose at the Australian people. That is what we are talking about here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Senate, this house of review, elected by the Australian people, has passed a motion concerning an order for the production of documents, and the government has failed continually to release those documents. For those listening at home, we're not asking for the documents to be put on the web or on the Prime Minister's Facebook page. We're not asking for the documents to be put in the public domain. We're asking for these documents concerning a terrorist organisation, which is actively involved in the murder of innocent citizens and in the production of terror activities across the world, to be released to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—a committee that meets in private.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has the government got to hide here? This is what this debate is about. The senators asked for these documents to be released. We know that these documents exist; it's not a fishing exercise. We know that the documents that have been requested are in existence, but this government have said no, they won't release them. They've claimed public interest immunity, but they've failed to substantiate the claims of public interest immunity. The minister's statement here before was a very nice collection of words that may have had the correct amounts of nouns and adverbs and adjectives to construct a sentence, but they did not construct a narrative as to why these documents should not be released. The government are hiding something, really hiding something.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Senate has the right and the power for these documents to be so ordered and released to the relevant parliamentary committee. So it comes down to transparency. Prime Minister, what are you hiding? Minister, what are you hiding? Executive cabinet, what are you hiding from the Australian people? This order for the production of documents does not relate to the angle at which paperclips should be bent. It is not an order for the production of documents for what size horseshoes should be. It is an order for the production of documents relating to a terrorist organisation, a terrible—there's tautology here—terrible terrorist organisation, which on a daily basis is actively involved in the murder of innocent people around the world. Yet this government are refusing to release the documents. As similarly bad as that, they are refusing to say on what basis they are refusing to release these documents to a committee that meets in private, is represented by the parties in government and can make decisions in relation to the security and the defence of this country to make sure that Australians can sleep safely in their beds at night. I say to the Prime Minister and the Labor Party: what do you have to hide? You promised to be transparent, but you're not being transparent. Day after day you mislead the Australian people, and you need to be better. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a>  What this government has demonstrated through their behaviour is that they are on a track that is immovable. By their actions, they are demonstrating that they are not prepared be accountable and transparent. Yet we all heard time and time again in the lead-up to the last election that there was going to be this new standard. Well, that's exactly right. We do have a new standard. We have set a very retrograde standard here in this place with the way that the government is operating with their complete disregard for the Senate and, as Senator McGrath was saying, by extension their complete disregard for the Australian people. It is appalling that they are not committing themselves to the transparency that they said that they would provide.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, it is more than just a pattern, because we're seeing it time and time again. How they behave is railed in. For example, they require any stakeholders that they're engaging with in relation to bills that are prospective and coming before the parliament to sign non-disclosure agreements. We've seen this with the car industry in relation to their fuel efficiency standards. They are making stakeholders sign up to agreements. They're requiring them not to speak publicly. If they do, guess what? You're not going to be invited the very next meeting. They only bring into the room those that are maybe going to speak up and speak the way that they want them to speak. This is the behaviour of this government. We've seen it with the ALRC report. We've seen it with the consultation on the potential future religious discrimination bill. They'll only engage with those that are prepared to keep silent and not engage their wider constituency. This is atrocious. It is not the transparency and accountability that was promised by this government. The Prime and Minister, as leader of the Labor Party, as the leader of our nation in the political atmosphere that we have, is letting the Australian people down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have a simple request by the Senate for a document. It is not that it be released publicly; we understand that there are often national security implications, particularly in relation to the listing of an organisation. The IRGC is a terrorist organisation, so of course there might be some national security implications. But we are the Senate. This was not just a couple of backbenchers or a couple of members of parliament. This Senate ordered that the government provide those documents to the PJCIS, a committee of this parliament that is bound by confidentiality and that meets in private—in fact, in a secure room in this building. Great measures are taken to ensure that documents that maybe sensitive, as have been requested here, are presented in a safe manner and are able to be dealt with appropriately. That committee is a committee of multiple members of parliament from multiple parties and it provides the transparency that is necessary.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again this government is proving that they are not submitting themselves to the accountability that is necessary. They made a commitment before the last election that there would be the accountability and that there would be a new standard. Well, we have seen a new standard. We have seen a lowered standard in this place when it comes to transparency and accountability, and this Prime Minister is shown wanting, time and time again. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  I too rise to speak to this issue, not so much with details about the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. I think anyone listening to this debate would understand that the IRGC has been one of the key backers and supporters of terrorism both in their region and around the world and, as we have seen in recent times, also inflicting terror and totalitarian rule on the citizens of Iran, many of whom have lost their lives or their freedom standing up against a regime that brutally puts its own people down. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk today though about the process of the parliament being the representatives of the people and holding the executive and its departments to account. Particularly, I come to this as someone who has served on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for nearly a decade. Through that process, we dealt with some thorny issues when it came to listing—for example, the terrorist organisation Hezbollah. For many years, Australia had listed the external security organisation of Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation, but not the entirety, because of concerns that parts of Hezbollah were parts of government in other nations and therefore perhaps it wouldn't be appropriate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a long and involved discussion, with multiple stakeholders who came and presented their perspectives—in confidence, in classified hearings—to the committee. That committee, having considered all of those facts, still made the recommendation that the entirety of Hezbollah should be listed. I'm pleased to report that in 2021 the entirety of the organisation was listed. In 2022, Hamas was listed. And we have seen in the past, groups like the Islamic State, who were also putting themselves forward as a government for a period of time, have been listed multiple times—the most recent in 2023. But a key point here is that the whole purpose of the PJCIS, established under the Intelligence Services Act, is to enable the parliament, on behalf of the people of Australia, to have oversight over both departments and the security agencies when it comes to decisions such as this. The practice to date has been disclosure within that classified environment to enable an informed debate to occur. So this decision of the Albanese government runs against the practice of governments of both sides of politics over many years which saw the PJCIS as a trusted entity to fulfil that function of insuring transparency and oversight on behalf of the Australian people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has demonstrated over many years that it is capable of dealing with sensitive issues around national security and foreign relations that often underpin decisions around things such as listing, so this decision is bewildering, to say the least. I would also note that the committee has been largely proven right in its insistence that things like Hezbollah be listed in its entirety. When those listings have been made, the statement of reasons is actually a document which is designed to be released publicly so that the Australian public can get an insight, though perhaps not of every detail and not every consideration—that's why we have the committee, to consider those things in a classified environment—but it provides the Australian people with a rationale and some insight as to why this decision has been taken. The fact that this document was developed indicates that the departments recognise that there is a case for listing the whole of the IRGC. The fact that it is designed as a document to be released publicly means that the request for that to be provided to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is actually the committee ceding quite a bit of ground, saying 'We're happy to deal with this in a classified environment' when it's a document that should have been released publicly. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a breach of trust in the parliamentary structures which have been set in place to oversee our intelligence and security. I call on the government to be transparent. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen some remarkable moments in politics, but last night the evidence of the government, the minister and the senior officials from Home Affairs about this bill was extraordinary. It was extraordinary in the lack of information they had about what on earth is urgent in this bill, who the bill will apply to and what the potential scope of the minister's powers will be. You would think that a competent government which is seeking to ram legislation through in less than two days would at least have a credible argument about why it is urgent. But, astoundingly, neither the minister nor the secretary nor any senior official could come up with a credible reason as to why this legislation is being rammed through in less than two days—not one credible reason. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't as though they weren't given opportunities. The opposition asked repeatedly, 'Please give us a reason for saying this is urgent.' There was no credible answer from Home Affairs. When we asked which categories of visa holder this law would apply to and what the numbers were, we got confused and bemused looks from Home Affairs. They had no answer to even the most basic questions about who the bill would apply to. They think it will apply to people in detention. Maybe it will apply to some people who were the subject of last year's High Court case, but they would investigate that over the next two months. It could apply to other people on bridging visas, but they can't tell us who. And they want us to ram it through as though it is urgent. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rarely have I seen more collective incompetence than we saw from Home Affairs and the government last night. And this is the big political moment. This is apparently the big political play from Labor this week: they have these tough-on-refugees, tough-on-asylum-seeker laws. They're beating their chests. This is their big political play, and it was pathetic. It was worse than pathetic. It was actually grossly negligent, the incompetence that they showed. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we asked who they had consulted on the bill. Had they consulted any NGO? Had they consulted the UN High Commission? Had they consulted anybody outside government on a bill that they want to ram through with no public consultation at all? The incredible answer was 'nobody'.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the lowest, most base level of public policy being driven by the Albanese Labor government, for only one reason. That became so clear last night. This isn't about keeping Australia safe. This isn't about some credible responsible to a crisis in migration. This is a pure political play that's unravelling as we watch. This is about Labor trying to outflank the coalition and move to the right of the coalition in a bill that they seem to have just made up in some long late-night drinking session and then brought to the parliament. You couldn't make this stuff up. This is meant to be a government that's now run by adults, but this was like some sort of kiddie's crayon drawing being brought into parliament and then defended by embarrassed officials and half-briefed ministers. That's what we got last night.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be negligent of this Senate to pass this bill on the half-baked assurances, incomplete information and close to riddles we got last night from Home Affairs. It would be negligent for us. So we are moving that the provisions of the Migration Amendment (Removal and Other Measures) Bill 2024 be referred immediately to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 24 June 2024. I'd love to just move that we just whack it straight in the bin, because that's where it should go—actually, pop it in recycling. We're Greens. Pop it in recycling. But that's where this should go. Go back home. I say to the government: don't pass Go; go directly to jail with this bill.</span>

We've seen the usual Woollahra sophistry that we see from Senator Shoebridge. What we're about to see is what happens when Senator Shoebridge and Senator Cash, symbolising what's really happening here—what's really happening here is when Mr Dutton's Liberals and Nationals and Mr Bandt's Greens decide that they are going to put partisan interest over the national interest. What we're seeing is the most right-wing extremist Liberal Party in Australia's history and this trot-out bit down here. When they get together in their usual student politics exercise of putting their own partisan interest over the national interest, you're about to see the result. If Senator Shoebridge is right and the government's effort to put the national interest here first unravels today, what the people of Australia will see is that the old days, when the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party understood that their job was to put the national interest before the partisan interest, are over. Those days are over. This is a show that doesn't understand the national interest. It doesn't understand it.</span>

What we're about to see here is this show failing the character test absolutely: Mr Dutton, the most extreme leader of the Liberal Party in its history, teaming up with Mr Bandt and Senator Shoebridge, the most Trotskyite edition of the Greens we have ever seen, to absolutely put before the national interest the partisan interest. If only national security were about words and bluster. If only it were about partisan positioning. After the last nine last years of torpid, lazy, complacent partisan government, we would be safer than we've ever been, but the truth is that reforming this migration system matters. Protecting the integrity of the immigration system matters. The Dutton opposition, after Mr Dutton's administration of these questions—</span>

And why do you think he did that? Because there would have been the usual narrow, self-interested, partisan-interest consideration. Mr Dutton had a bit of a think about it and thought: 'Whose problem is this really? Somebody else's problem down the track. What's my job here? To position for myself.' That's what Mr Dutton did in 2018. That's what the Morrison government did in those sad, sordid years of maladministration, of weak staffing, of under-resourcing and of weak political leadership on these questions. That's what they did from 2019 to 2022. And we're about to see on full display in this chamber what happens when you get a group of right-wing political extremists with no regard for the national interest and a bunch of Trots cooking up a solution to this that they recognise as in their partisan interest.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  Quite frankly, <span style="font-style:italic;">Seinfeld</span> could not have scripted the last 24 hours of the Albanese government! To say that the last 24 hours has been chaotic is an absolute understatement, and that is why the coalition is supporting the motion that is being moved by the Australian Greens. We will, of course, be amending it, and I foreshadow an amendment. Senator Ayres talked a big game. I give him that. He talked a big game. That's fair enough. He talked a big game. He does that well. But let's look at what Senator Ayres actually said when you break it down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He talked about those of us failing a character test. Senator Ayres, I put to you that the Prime Minister fails the character test on these bases: he fails the test when it comes to scrutiny; he fails the test when it comes to transparency; and he fails the test when it comes to accountability. Why do I say that? Look at what the Prime Minister said to the Australian people. The Australian people should reflect on what the Prime Minister told them before the election. Before the election, when Mr Albanese was in promise-making mode—post the election, we're in a very different mode—he told the Australian people this: if he and the Australian Labor Party were elected to office, he and his ministers would deliver transparency, integrity and accountability in everything they do. Well, I have to say, the last 24 hours of this government have shown that that is blatantly false. Actions, in this case, Prime Minister, speak louder than words. Anyone who has not seen the footage of Minister O'Neill this morning running from the press in the press gallery, running away—all they wanted to ask her were questions in relation to this legislation, the first one being, as Senator Paterson opened last night with: why is this legislation urgent?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have thought the Australian people would think that is a reasonable question, given we are being asked to rush it through the parliament today under a guillotine—and, for those who don't know what a guillotine means, it means we have, as the opposition and the Australian Greens, no opportunity on behalf of the Australian people to scrutinise this legislation. So one would think, to a simple question by Senator Patterson last night in committee, and by journalists today to Senator O'Neill, of why this legislation is urgent, Senator O'Neill and the officials last night could clearly have articulated a reason. This is where the problem lies, because they couldn't. They said to us, 'Trust us.' The last time the Australian people trusted the Albanese government, they were let down miserably.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to secrecy, when it comes to a lack of transparency, when it comes to a lack of accountability, which is what this motion moved by the Australian Greens goes to—that is, giving the Australian Senate on behalf of the Australian people the opportunity to properly scrutinise this legislation, because the government has failed to articulate any sort of urgency associated with it—Dennis Shanahan, in his article of 25 March—quite frankly, he sums it up: 'Labor's transparency vow lies bleeding from a thousand cuts.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the reality for the Australian people: the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General trumpeted before the election that if you voted for them you were heralding in a new era of transparency, but you all need to wake up. The Australian Labor Party run the Senate and House of Representatives like a shop floor. That is it. They're the union in control, and guess what? The rest of us don't have a say. They will use any form of tactic to silence us. And in silencing us—Mr Albanese, shame on you, because you silence the Australian people! That is the history of the Australian Labor Party: 'Nothing to see here.' If you bully people enough, if you intimidate them enough, they will eventually capitulate and fall over. Well, guess what? We are not going to do that. We are going to stand firm on behalf of the Australian people. We will support this motion and we will ensure that this bill gets the proper scrutiny it requires because, as I said, you've said it's not urgent.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  The ugly truth is that this bill that the Labor Party is ramming through today is a manifestation of the toxic politics of fear and division from both of the big parties that have poisoned the national discourse for far too long. Such is the moral bankruptcy that has seeped into the heart of both major parties and their politics that we are now pushing through—we're not even debating it—a bill that Donald Trump would probably be proud of. And it's not just being put forward; it's being rushed through. It was introduced just yesterday in the House, with a sham two-hour inquiry last night, and now here we have it being rammed through the Senate. The bipartisan agreement on cruelty to refugees has really hit a new low today. Both parties are trading in human suffering to score cheap political points in a race to the bottom, targeting the most vulnerable—refugees and people who seek asylum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is such a pitiful race to the bottom. Labor is trying to out-Dutton Mr Dutton, the very man who has dog whistled his way to the top of the Liberal Party. Labor has no answers on why this bill should be rushed or any details of the bill, as you just heard Senator Shoebridge telling us, and they have consulted no-one. Yet here we are in this situation, rushing it through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Migration Amendment (Removal and Other Measures) Bill 2024 is an extraordinary expansion of ministerial powers, to the point that the Human Rights Law Centre has called the powers 'godlike'. The bill so significantly expands the powers of the minister that the minister can unilaterally, subject only to consultation with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, designate a country to be a removal concern country. The effect of this will be that almost all nationals from that country are prohibited from applying for any visa to come to Australia, and only the minister can decide if they want to lift that prohibition. The bill doesn't require them to even consider that request.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not just extremely dangerous policy; it is also extraordinarily racist. The Labor Party are drawing inspiration not just from the Leader of the Opposition but also Donald Trump as they write these powers into laws for themselves, egged on by the coalition. This is no surprise, though, to anyone who has been following the Labor Party's trajectory of demonising refugees and migrants—so much so that the Minister for Home Affairs, Clare O'Neil, shamefully said last year, 'The Leader of the Opposition loves to present himself as a tough guy on borders. He never wrote laws as tough as this.' You should not be proud of this; you should be ashamed of this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, this bill will allow the government to force people to return to countries where they face persecution and even death. This is the absolute worst of politics in this country, and both Labor and the coalition should be ashamed for supporting this bill. Make no mistake: at its core, this bill is racist in nature. It seeks to criminalise migrants, refugees and people who seek asylum. This is one of the many insidious ways in which power and privilege are wielded to perpetuate systems of oppression and marginalisation, and this bill is a prime example of institutionalised racism masquerading as immigration policy. Shame on you!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, during the debate to refer the bill to committee, we heard that the government didn't even consult with the Human Rights Commission; didn't think to check in and say, 'Hey, do you think this is in line with any of our obligations?' After two hours of questioning from Senator Paterson, Senator Cash, Senator Shoebridge and Senator Ghosh, there was really no more clarity on the urgency of this bill or on who it will actually apply to or why there is the need to hand the minister the power to basically bring anyone in to make regulation at will. I find it pretty offensive when Labor then turns around and points at the crossbenchers and accuses us of not caring about community safety—of not caring about a whole range of things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community wants scrutiny of these sorts of bills. They want the right balance. They want not only to ensure that, yes, we have orderly borders and that, yes, communities are protected but also to uphold our international human rights obligations, which both the major parties seem to agree to and then disregard when it comes to how we treat various people in Australia. This is an opportunity to have a bit more scrutiny, to look at it and to then come back, because it was very unclear last night why this is so urgent. There was no good reason that I heard. So I fully support having an inquiry into this bill.</span>

                  </a>  Today ends the lecturing from those opposite about acting in the national interest and keeping Australia safe, because we see today the opposition, who talk big on all of these issues, siding with the Greens political party to defer a matter that our advisers have told us is important to get done. So let there be no more lectures from those opposite, no more trying to wind up the scare campaigns and no more accusations of us not working in the national interest, because we see a clear example today of the opposition not acting in the national interest. That is on Senator Cash, Senator Birmingham and, of course, Mr Dutton. If you look at some of the reforms that we've had to bring in, it's because of a broken system that we inherited. We've had the Nixon review, the Richardson review and others: all of those reviews are a damning indictment of the Leader of the Opposition and his carriage of these matters as minister responsible for Australia's migration and immigration system.</span>

You have no credibility on that anymore. The Department of Home Affairs last night at the hearing on the bill said: 'This legislation is one which we believe is a significant issue to resolve within our migration system for its broader integrity.' That was the evidence provided to the opposition. What we've seen today is the opposition siding with the Greens to kick this off—to not deal with it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a>  Yeah, right. Okay. Yeah, yeah—tell another one. Tell another one. They'll kick it off for four weeks and not deal with it today. Our advisers say that it does need to be dealt with and that it should be dealt with in this sitting week. We provided briefings to you. We provided the committee inquiry to you so that you could have that opportunity. I don't think there was anything that came through the committee process that indicated any reason to delay this. We've been working to improve the integrity of the migration system for the last 18 months. As we know, the Parkinson review, the Richardson review and the Nixon review all indicated that we had inherited a system that was broken. Where there are issues identified, loopholes that need to close and powers that need to be strengthened, as a government we will work carefully and methodically to deal with those. We will present that to the chamber and, in this case to the opposition. We presumed—wrongly, it seems—that they would want to work with us in the national interest to strengthen our security and our immigration system. We believed a mature opposition—and, perhaps again, that was our mistake—would actually work with us on this to deal with it quickly. Instead, we see an attempt to just kick it down the road. This is on your heads. The fact that we are leaving this bill unresolved until, at the earliest opportunity, budget week if you move your amendments. We know that budget week hardly deals with any legislation, so the chances are it will move beyond that as well.</span>

Our officials have told us that this is a significant issue to resolve for the migration system's broader integrity. That is what you are voting against today. You are voting to delay it. We'll see the reasons why, no doubt, over the next four weeks, but there will be no more lectures from you on national security or strengthening our borders after today's vote.</span>

You know just how bad it is when, despite the very different positions we take from the Greens in relation to border protection, we come to the same conclusion that this is the most hopeless, hapless, chaotic process you could possibly imagine. That's why the government needs proper scrutiny over its legislation and this approach. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the government could have managed this process so much better, because yesterday morning, when they ambushed us with the bill, they gave us a bill date stamped last Friday. So if it was important, why didn't they give it to us last Friday? If it was important, why didn't they share it then? If it could withstand scrutiny, why didn't they introduce it last week, not on the death knell of this sitting? We know they can't withstand scrutiny, which is why they don't want to have any scrutiny. The ministers run away from the cameras in the press gallery, and here in the parliament they want to run away from the normal scrutiny of legislation. </span>

                  </span>We're not going to stand for that. We went through the responsible process of hearing from the department last night. It left more questions than answers. That's why it's important there is proper scrutiny of this bill. That's why we are supporting that. We will deal with it, if you want, the first day back of the next sitting. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  There is, potentially, a long list of legislation to be dealt with today. I won't detain the chamber. I make the point that the opposition is proposing to include a piece of government legislation. It's legislation that is viewed by industry and others as being important, that has progressed through the House and that has been awaiting progress through the Senate. In our view, in terms of ensuring economic certainty, progress and energy certainty in this country, this is an important bill to consider. That is why we are moving for its inclusion. I would urge the government to support their own legislation by having this bill included.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I rise this afternoon to speak on two extremely important issues and two very different groups of Australians. I am speaking about vaping and veterans affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have made it abundantly clear in the past that vaping is a scourge on our society. It is an issue that I take seriously. In my youth, we had the same issue with cigarette smoking. Many teenagers took up the habit, unaware of the risks to their health. They got addicted due to the nicotine content and they ended up with cancer or other terrifying conditions. Nicotine itself, while being highly addictive, is not the direct cause of the vaping or smoking related illnesses. It is instead the filler materials that cigarettes, cigars and vapes are packed with: arsenic, acetone and butane are just three examples of the destructive chemicals inside these items. Despite claims that vapes only emit water vapour, vapes contain oils that can stick to the inside of our lungs, potentially causing pneumonia and other significant health issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vapes prescribed by a doctor for the purpose of quitting smoking are different from the vapes that are sold underground. We do not know what substances or materials are actually in the types of vapes that are sold on the black market. What we do know is that organised crime and the setting up of shops and retail outlets to sell to under-age children are very much part of the issue that we are confronting in this country. The sale of any e-liquids or vaping products containing nicotine for personal use by Australian retailers is now illegal. There are no nicotine vaping products being sold underground which have been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. They are now classified as a dangerous poison under the national Poisons Standard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in the Gillard Labor government, we took the issue of smoking very, very seriously, and it was former minister Nicola Roxon who did so much work within the Gillard Labor government to tackle and reduce the scourge of smoking in this country. We enacted legislation to discourage cigarette smoking in Australia by introducing the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011. Shortly afterwards, Cancer Australia reported that there was at least a 25 per cent decrease in smoking rates in Australia between 2012 and 2015. Current figures unfortunately point to an increase in smoking, with vaping being a gateway to cigarette addiction. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the Gillard Labor government, we want to protect our young people from the perils of smoking. Thus, it is the intent of this government to do all we can to stamp out the scourge of vaping here in Australia. We are working together with the state and territory governments to increase the minimum quality standards for vapes so that the make-up of ingredients can be better controlled. In addition to this, we're making sure that, like cigarettes, vaping products are all packaged with plain, pharmaceutical packaging. I refer to the figure I mentioned before: the Cancer Council detected at least a 25 per cent decrease in cigarette smoking after the plain packaging act was introduced by the Gillard Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue is serious. We're not stopping there. We are investing $737 million from the tobacco excise revenue to fund new measures to protect Australians against vaping related illnesses and to discourage them from vaping in the first place. A significant portion of the funding will go towards establishing support programs to help Australians quit vaping and strengthen training amongst health professionals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are stamping out the scourge of vaping in Australia. When shops selling vaping products are opening outside schools—including primary schools—to get more traffic, it should be blatantly clear that we are dealing with a massive problem in this country. We are also dealing with a black market of illicit vaping products. These reforms by the Albanese Labor government are stamping out black markets and regulating the market so that people who need to access vapes for medical reasons still can and that recreational vaping is phased out. Unfortunately, those opposite, the Liberals, the Nationals and even the Greens, don't seem to share the same concerns. The Liberals and the Nationals are too preoccupied with big donations from the tobacco companies and are therefore not prepared to stand up, and we know that the Greens are more interested in young people's votes than they are in their health. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've lived through the scourge of nicotine addiction from cigarette smoking, and I've seen what it has caused. I've seen too many Australians die. I see too many people using our health system. With this scourge of vaping, which is a gateway into cigarette smoking—and, may I suggest, to other drugs—we as a government are going to be strong and resilient and ensure we do all that we can to protect young Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take a moment to also talk about another important area of government policy and a commitment that we made before the last election. That commitment was to attack the scourge of the long waiting times for veterans to have their claims assessed. The Albanese Labor government are delivering on the commitment we made. I want to congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Matt Keogh, in the other place, for his leadership and great work. Within the Department of Veterans' Affairs, we no longer have any backlog of compensation claims being processed. We made a promise to clear any backlogs by the end of March, and by the end of February they were cleared—a month earlier than expected. That is really good news. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since July last year, the Department of Veterans' Affairs has processed over 64,000 claims. That is over 64,000 Australians who were owed compensation for service related injuries or illnesses who have been helped, as have their families, since July last year. Unlike those opposite—when they were in government that backlog continued to grow and to grow—we've tackled it. We've delivered another election promise. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we are delivering to Australian veterans, and we will continue to do that because we appreciate and respect the contributions that they have made to this country. We want to keep up the good work in the veterans affairs space, and so we're investing in staff, the IT systems and ensuring more timely access to veterans affairs services for veterans and their families. The Albanese Labor government supports those who have served and stood up for our country in our times of need. We respect the work that the Defence Force have done in protecting Australia—whether you go back to the First World War, the Second World War, Korea or Vietnam. What we need to ensure is this: when our veterans come home from a conflict, or during their service, if they need help and assistance with their injuries and illnesses, they should know that their waiting times will be a matter of weeks, not months or years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Too often in this place, those on that side come into this chamber and lecture us about what we're not doing, and how good they have been, in relation to issues like Veterans Affairs and the support for our defence forces. The reality is very, very different. After 10 years of neglect by those opposite, it took a Labor government to employ more staff, to invest in the technology and, more importantly, to invest in the people to ensure that those backlogs were cleared. Sixty-four thousand Australians have been helped since July last year. That's an incredible effort, and that's the sort of determination Australians will get from this Labor government. I commend the minister for his great work.</span>

                  <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  Freedom of belief is not an optional extra in our society. Let me say that again: freedom of belief or freedom of religion is not an optional extra. It is a core part of who we are, what we believe and the way our society functions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the Albanese Labor government table the Australian Law Reform Commission report into religious educational institution and discrimination laws. Unsurprisingly, this report has sparked an enormous degree of concern from faith based educational institutions. They have warned that the report's recommendations would severely limit the ability of faith based educational institutions to operate and teach according to their faith. That is why these institutions exist in the first place. Parents choose to send their children to these institutions because they do operate within the beliefs and the faiths of those families that are involved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps most egregiously, the way the government has approached this issue is clouded in secrecy, where you have seen non-disclosure agreements being required of individuals to see the draft legislation. Non-disclosure agreements from a government so their approach to these laws is hidden under a cloak of secrecy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say again, freedom of belief is not an optional extra. In fact, it's written into our Constitution—our foundational document. I'm going to read it because the Constitution probably isn't quoted enough in this place. Section 116 of the Constitution says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very clear what that foundational document of our society says. Yes, it says we shouldn't require people to hold a certain faith to take positions within government or public service, but we should also not do anything to prohibit the free exercise of any religion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Religion and faith cannot be taken as something locked inside a person's house when they enter the front door for a private space only. People express their faith through, for example, where they decide to send their children for their education. In doing so, they make decisions based on their values, their beliefs and the understanding that those institutions would have the right to communicate that understanding, that belief, that faith. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, it seems that this government is seeking to undermine that core principle, which is not just of our Constitution and inherent in a fair and free society but actually inherent, in principle, in the entire Enlightenment movement that gave us Western democracy in the first place. It's one of the few freedoms that are actually explicitly mentioned in our Constitution. That is how important it is. So I say to all those out there who choose to send their children to a faith based institution that you have our support to ensure that those institutions can continue to operate within the precepts of their faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is seeking to impose through some clever marketing phrases a destructive regime upon this country, and it's hidden under the lovely phrase 'nature positive'. Could you get a more Orwellian phrase than 'nature positive'? But, having just a quick look at some of the initial statements that have come out of the government in terms of material and the way the department is seeking to implement nature positive, we see that it is just a marketing phrase. In actual fact, this approach to the law will be negative. It will be negative for employment. It will be negative for business going forward. It will be negative for development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at what we've found out about these laws so far, and then take them back a few years. If these laws had existed 40 years ago in Western Australia, we would have no mining industry. If they had existed 50 years ago in Western Australia, we would have no gas industry. If they had existed 80 years ago in Western Australia, we would have no commercial fishing industry and probably no recreational fishing industry. If they had existed 100 years ago in Western Australia, we would have no agricultural sector. I say to everyone in my home state of Western Australia: just think about that for a few moments. Think about that when you hear this Orwellian phrase—'nature positive'. Think about what it actually means.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cat was belled with one of the first documents that came out under the banner of this nature positive, with a bureaucrat recommending a policy of 40-kilometre-an-hour speed limits on major highways in the Pilbara. The fact that that even got anywhere close to being included in a policy document is an indictment both on the Labor government and on the bureaucracy. It shows that they have no clue about Western Australia. They have no clue about the vast distances involved in the north of WA and, in particular, the iron ore industry, as well as other extractive industries. They have no clue about a sensible balance between the responsible preservation of the natural environment, which is important, and the need to continue to have economic growth to fuel the living standard that we enjoy in Australia and also to be able to generate the next round of activity and development and progress, technological process, that will drive our society forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Nature positive' is a phrase that means almost nothing. Or, even more dangerously, it means whatever the government and the bureaucracy want it to mean in terms of closing down industry. It smacks of authoritarian overreach and ideological zealotry. It's a philosophy that seeks to constrain, control and limit those very industries that have been the source of Western Australia's success for the past 100 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say again: if there had been nature-positive laws 100 years ago, we would have no agricultural industry in Western Australia. If there had been nature-positive laws 80 years ago, we would have no commercial fishing industry and no recreational fishing. If there had been nature-positive laws 40 years ago, we would have no mining industry and no gas industry. These are not laws Western Australia can afford.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RENNICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  In January 2017, on the day before Donald Trump was inaugurated, Anthony Fauci made the following statement in a speech at Georgetown University:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… if there's one message that I want to leave with you today based on my experience … it's that there is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases, both chronic infectious diseases, in the sense of already ongoing disease … Also, there will be a surprise outbreak …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That would have to be one of the most incredible statements of this century: a scientist predicting a surprise outbreak in the term of an elected president. I don't know about you, but I didn't know that viruses were political. Yet here we have a scientist, the head of the infectious disease department in the United States, predicting three years in advance of COVID that there would be a surprise infectious disease outbreak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you google this, you'll come up with a Reuters fact check that says: 'It's all true. He said that, but he didn't say it was coronavirus; he didn't say it was COVID.' It doesn't really matter. The fact of the matter is that there need to be serious questions asked about what Anthony Fauci knew about the origins of coronavirus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I well remember at the start of the outbreak, when Australia and most of the world—certainly the Western world—were locked down incessantly for two years amongst that barrage of fearmongering, that our then foreign minister, Senator Marise Payne, called for an investigation into the origins of coronavirus. Yet here we are, four years removed to the month from the outbreak of that disease, from the time when these lockdowns occurred, and there are crickets about the origins of coronavirus. That is not fair to the Australian people or to people in other parts of the world who had to endure government overreach in the name of keeping people safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian people have a right to know if that virus was an actual lab leak as a result of gain-of-function research. They have a right to know that our intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies are monitoring this type of gain-of-function research, both in our universities—it is occurring—and in other universities across the world. We do not want to see another outbreak of the government fearmongering that we saw four years ago. I just want to call this out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We often hear the narrative today that there's another pandemic around the corner. When I grew up, I never heard any sort of language like that. There are comparisons back to the Spanish flu—how that was a really bad outbreak and that another outbreak like the Spanish flu can occur again. It is highly unlikely that another outbreak like the Spanish flu will occur again, for the very simple reason of the discovery of penicillin. What killed most people in the Spanish flu wasn't the virus; it was the secondary bacterial infection that occurs when you get a virus infection in the first instance. It was probably what killed most people in those Victorian aged-care centres in August 2020, but, yet again, do we investigate this? No. We don't want to look at it. This fearmongering and this narrative that somehow we've got to be prepared for the next pandemic outbreak is overblown. We have this wonderful invention—probably the most important invention of the 20th century—called antibiotics and, in particular, penicillin. This fearmongering needs to stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I fear that, for those people on the other side of the chamber and those people who seem to think that the world should be governed from the top down rather than from the bottom up, it suits them all too well to do with our health what they've done to the weather, saying that only big government can save you, only big corporations can save you. That rubbish needs to stop. People need to be responsible for their own actions. They do not need the paternalism of big government stepping and overstepping into the daily lives of everyday people. That is not what liberal democracy is about. But I digress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I actually want to go back and talk about the origins of the coronavirus. You see, the strange thing is that, just after the outbreak of coronavirus, there was a series of leaked emails amongst a number of key professors who somehow knew Anthony Fauci. Anthony Fauci was in contact with the professors. If you actually look at the early leaks from before Anthony Fauci started talking to the intelligence agencies, you see they were all convinced that this outbreak was a gain-of-function outbreak because there was a furin cleavage site. Furin is an enzyme that attaches the spike protein of the virus to the ACE receptor of your cells. It was designed to speed up infection. This was completely novel, and the chance of this happening in nature is like a big bang. I've had a number of microbiologists tell me the chance of this happening is extremely low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the viewpoint of a number of scientists. I will name them: Kristian Andersen, Edward Holmes, Ian Lipkin, Andrew Rambaut and Robert Garry. These five scientists just happened to get into an email trail with Anthony Fauci. They went from going, 'This is an actual lab leak—gain of function,' to, 'It can't possibly be gain of function; it's natural evolution, and anyone that suggests it's possibly gain-of-function is a conspiracy theorist.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It turns out that Anthony Fauci actually funded an organisation called EcoHealth. EcoHealth was run by a man by the name of Peter Daszak. He was the lead author of a paper, published by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lancet</span> not long after coronavirus was used to lock everyone down, that completely ridiculed the notion that coronavirus was actually gain-of-function research. I should read some of the comments that were made, in particular by Edward Holmes. The reason I want to concentrate on Edward Holmes is that he's an Australian scientist who works at the University of Sydney. He has received over $4 million in research for viruses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the comments he made very early on in this email trail was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… Ian Lipkin just called, very worried about the furin cleavage site and says the high ups are as well, including Intel. Also saw the restriction site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ian Lipkin's comments about Edward Holmes were:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Dr. Holmes became very unhappy with me after I refused to sign on and say that, you know, there was proof that this is where this began, in the wet market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is clear evidence of an email trail suggesting that there was a cover-up as to the origins of the coronavirus. This cover-up was actually led by people who were working in gain-of-function research and who were actually funded by the US government, albeit working in China. The other thing worth noting is that this Professor Holmes was actually an honorary professor at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I raised this issue at estimates with ASIO and other intelligence organisations, they had absolutely no interest in investigating Professor Edward Holmes from Sydney university, despite the fact that he has received millions of dollars in funding from Australian taxpayers, despite the fact that he was one of only six scientists that Anthony Fauci decided to talk about the origins of coronavirus with, and despite the fact that he was an honorary professor at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Now, I don't know about you, but I would have thought this needs to be investigated. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question I want to leave with my constituents and my fellow Australians out there today is: why aren't Australian intelligence agencies, as well as intelligence agencies in other countries, interested in investigating the origins of coronavirus, the gain of research that was involved with the origins of coronavirus, who funded it and why there was a cover-up? We owe it to the Australian people that this sort of government overreach can never happen again. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I rise to talk about the Albanese government's top priority: providing cost-of-living relief to Australian families. Our cost-of-living plan is providing relief in three critical ways. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, we have introduced measures to reduce cost pressures for families, Labor's cheaper medicines policy saved families in my home state of New South Wales $63 million last year. Labor's 60-day prescriptions have already saved Australians $12 million, and it has only been in place since September. The Liberals and Nationals opposed cheaper medicines because they said it would cause pharmacies to close. But the data is in. And, in the six months since 60-day prescriptions began, applications to open new pharmacies are up 50 per cent. Now, either those opposite had no idea what they were talking about or they were being very loose with the truth yet again. We made medicines cheaper, despite opposition from the Liberals and Nationals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has made child care cheaper, saving the average family $1,780 per year. Labor has sent 350,000 people to TAFE for free, providing cost-of-living relief, or giving Aussie workers the skills they need to get well-paid secure jobs. Now, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party said fee-free TAFE was 'wasteful spending'. Can you really believe it? Those opposite gave $40 billion of JobKeeper payments to companies that actually increased their profits, but they are saying helping people get free education is a waste of money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is also investing in increasing housing supply through the Housing Australia Future Fund and of course the Liberals and Nationals voted against that too. After doing nothing about high housing prices for a decade, they have stopped trying to fix the mess that they created.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of messes that we inherited, we are taking action on energy policy. Labor's Energy Bill Relief Fund saved the average Australian household $230 on their energy bill last year. Of course, the Liberals and Nationals voted against that too. Just last week, the Australian Energy Regulator announced small businesses in New South Wales will see their power bills go down by up to 9.7 per cent and households by up to 7.1 per cent. These figures show our plan for cheap, clean and reliable energy is bringing down the high power prices we inherited from those opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the alternative plan put forward by the Liberals and Nationals? A nuclear fantasy that will take 20 years and cost taxpayers not tens of millions but hundreds of millions of dollars to even deliver the first reactor. The Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor in the United Kingdom has just come in at $86 billion—just for one power station—and those opposite want to build six! How will six $86 billion power stations bring down power costs? They cannot tell you across the way. They have not released any details or costings. So, on health, education, child care, housing and energy, we are reducing cost pressures, and those opposite are voting against us at every opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second way we're providing cost-of-living relief is through our tax cuts by ensuring Australians keep more of the money they earn. Under Labor's tax cuts, all 13.6 million taxpayers will receive a tax cut. That's 2.9 million more than would have benefitted from Scott Morrison's plan from five years ago. Most importantly, 84 per cent of taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut. So we're bringing costs down, we're helping Aussies keep more of what they earn and—thirdly—we're laser focused on ensuring Aussie workers earn more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over their decade in government, the Liberals and Nationals had a deliberate plan to keep wages low. It wasn't a secret. Their finance minister said it on national television. The Liberals and Nationals are for low pay because lower pay means higher profits for their paymasters in the corporate sector. That's the business model of those opposite. Those opposite have opposed or voted against every single measure we have taken to grow wages and improve job security. The Liberals and Nationals opposed the increase to the minimum wage in 2022 and in 2023, and we're seeing what their response is now. It's the same sort of argument to keep wages lower. Under the increases Labor called for, minimum wage earners now have $110 more per week than they had under the previous government. That's $110 more per week than before we came to government. We have proudly said again for the 2024 minimum wage decision that we believe those on the minimum wage must not go backwards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we heard from those opposite? The member for New England, Barnaby Joyce, said someone earning another $110 a week is more like just 'window dressing'. He is seriously saying that someone earning $110 more a week is mere 'window dressing'. Explain that to people on minimum wage. Senator Hume, the shadow finance minister, complained on Monday morning that 'the Labor government wants to make minimum wages go higher as a cost-of-living measure'. Yes, we do. That's exactly what we want to see happen. That's why we advocated for increases to the minimum wage. That's why we passed our secure jobs, better pay bill, and those opposite voted against it. Secure jobs and better pay do two things those opposite cannot abide. The shadow Treasurer, Angus Taylor, said at the time that he opposed the secure jobs, better pay bill because 'it pushes up wages'. The opposition leader, Mr Dutton, said in a media release that he opposed the bill because 'it's going to result in higher wages'. Well, yes, it does put up wages. That's the whole point. It was in the title. The Labor Party is here to improve pay and working conditions. It's incredible that Mr Dutton, Mr Taylor and Senator Hume, the three people responsible for economic policy in the Liberal Party, are so explicitly against wages going up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we get to the closing the loopholes bill. I have never seen such ridiculous and vicious opposition to a piece of legislation in this building. The bill closed a loophole for companies like Qantas and BHP, who used it to rip off their workers through labour hire. It made wage theft a criminal offence. It gave casuals the right to become permanent employees if they work like one. It gave gig workers and truck drivers the right to have minimum standards for the first time ever. Of course, they voted against all of that. The shadow minister for employment, Senator Cash, said the reforms would close down Australia. Instead we've seen unemployment all the way down, at 3.8 per cent, which is virtually full employment, we've seen inflation come down from the highs we inherited and we've seen real wages growing for the first time in years. It turns out you can pay people a living wage and give them job security, and the economy doesn't come crashing down—surprise, surprise. It turns out that all the predictions of Australia shutting down from the big business lobby, from the Minerals Council and from those opposite were total nonsense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what happens next? Given all these gains for wages and job security, what happens if the Liberals and Nationals get into government again? Well, don't take my word for it; look at what they're saying themselves. When the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was asked on Sky News if they would repeal these laws he said, 'Yes, we will.' The shadow Treasurer, Angus Taylor, said he may have a package of repeals in this area if he gets into government. Luke Howarth, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, said, on the closing the loopholes bills, 'We're going to get rid of this stuff when we come in.' That's a direct quote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rights for casuals, rights for labour hire workers, rights for gig workers and truck drivers, and protections against wage theft and industrial manslaughter are all on the chopping block when those opposite get back in. It'll be back to the bad old days. The only way to keep wages up is to keep the Liberals and Nationals out.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I rise today to call on the government to step in and help our artists and musicians, who are feeling the real brunt of the cost-of-living crisis. We've just heard the urgent and breaking news that Splendour in the Grass has been cancelled. This is another festival in Australia which is unable to go ahead because of all the associated pressures and costs. It is another festival in a long list of those that have had to be cancelled by organisers over only the last few months: Groovin the Moo, the Falls Festival, the Vintage Vibes Festival, ValleyWays, the Coastal Jam Festival and the Pitch Festival, and, of course, we know Dark Mofo has had its troubles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've all been cancelled, delayed or disrupted, and while people may think that this is just some type of entertainment that can fall by the wayside, I want to remind the government and the Minister for the Arts, Mr Burke, that arts and music are such an important part of what makes life great. It is also an important part of our economy. As festival organisers have to make the hard decisions, day after day, week after week, month after month, to cancel these events, they do so knowing that they're putting thousands of people out of work, that they're keeping money from flowing into small and regional communities right across the country and that that injection into those local economies is just not going to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we are in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, and when we're dealing with the struggles of families and individuals who are weighing up whether they can afford their skyrocketing rents, their inflated supermarket prices and their increased mortgage payments, we know that people just don't have the extra cash to buy that ticket to a music festival, no matter how much they would like to. But this is about people's jobs and we need the government to step in and support the music and festival industry urgently. Because of today's decision to cancel Splendour in the Grass, thousands of people will be out of work. Thousands of people—artists who were involved in this festival or hospitality workers who would have kept the festival going—will be scratching around, thinking about how they're going to pay their bills. Tourism and accommodation industry workers will be dumbfounded by this decision today. It is another festival biting the dust because there is not enough support from the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've written to the minister about this and about the previous festivals being cancelled. I have urged the minister to put in this year's budget a relief package or an assistance package for our music industry and our festivals industry. It is an important part of our culture, an important part of our regional and rural economies and an important part of our overall national economy. Musicians are workers too. Artists' jobs are real jobs. The tradies that put these festivals together need certainty. The hospitality workers deserve to know when their next pay cheque will come. And, when times are tough, Australians young and old know how important the arts are to us as a community to get us through. The festivals and the musicians were there for us during the bushfires, they were there during the floods and they copped the brunt during COVID. It's time we gave them a hand now.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  Life is about to change for every Australian. As much as Senator Gallagher seeks to downplay the significance of introducing one central digital identifier for each and every Australian, the reality is that this is the most significant legislation I've seen in my time in the Senate. It's the glue that holds together the digital control agenda by which every Australian will be controlled, corralled, exploited and then gagged when they speak or act in opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Digital ID Bill will be misused because this bill is written to be misused. The government knows that digital ID will be compulsory by the device of preventing access to government services, banking services, air travel and major purchases for any Australian who does not have a digital ID. The digital ID will, in effect, create a live data file of your movements, purchases, accounts and associates, containing reference to every piece of data being held in the private and government sector as the first step in a wider agenda. Google, Facebook and other tech giants have been building huge data files on every Australian for years. Those huge data files contain every website you've visited, every post you made on their social media and everything you have ever bought online, and the keywords scanned from conversations overheard by Siri and Alexa in your home are now unmasked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Until now, that data was anonymised using a unique identifier, rather than name and address, which has always been there as well. However, tech companies were not allowed to use it or to share data with others that included a person's name and address—until now. Look for the tech giants to ask for your digital ID as a requirement of using their service. The point of that exercise is to ensure they put the right name on the right data treasure trove. It's not just the tech giants heading into the data gold rush. Those reward cards you scan at the checkout have included terms and conditions to allow Coles and Woolies to make a record of every purchase you have made for years. This is why the Liberal Party has moved amendments to the Digital ID Bill to bring private corporations into this rollout earlier. All those treasure troves of data worth billions or trillions have accumulated for years illegally, and all that unrealised profit just sitting there has been too much of a temptation for the Liberals and Nationals to resist, and they have now joined with Labor in pushing digital ID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those listening at home may be wondering how an individual could avoid being drawn into this net of data trading and surveillance. The simple answer is: you can't. This Labor government has already passed the Identity Verification Services Bill, which makes it legal for every Australian's photo or video likeness to be used to verify that person against the database containing their biometric data. Biometric data simply means a digital representation of your face that allows for instantaneous electronic matching. Just days after that bill passed, the first thing the government did was send an email to people with a myGov ID to update their myGov record by providing a facial scan on their phone. Yes, that really happened. This is what these people are doing to you. This is not voluntary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ten million Australians have a myGov ID. Most of those were forced into it to access Centrelink benefits. It's cruel. There are another two million Australians who were forced to get a myGov ID to register as a company director, despite the director identity enabling legislation not even mentioning myGov. The government did it anyway! The database the government is using for data surveillance is the national driver's licence database which has 17 million records—everyone who has, or has had, a driver's licence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government doesn't need an excuse to further digital control for everyday Australians. Socialists love control. Socialism needs control. For socialism to exist, there must be control. The government knows control will be used by government to identify people who say mean things on social media to speed up enforcement of our new laws against saying home truths to crazy or dishonest people. There will be no hiding behind anonymous accounts or false addresses; you can expect a knock on your door at home, work or school, as we're seeing happening in other countries with digital identity already in place. Only by being able to keep tabs on citizens 24/7 can the government possibly hope to introduce the wealth heist they have planned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone viewing this topic for the first time can see the detail of what I'm talking about on my website. The committee report on the digital ID bill was a travesty. The committee made a recommendation to pass the bill, which was simply not supported by the evidence they received during the inquiry. Witness after witness testified that this rancid evil bill failed to protect privacy, failed to establish that the ID would be voluntary, failed on human rights grounds and failed on technical grounds. One blackout, and the whole thing comes crashing down. Yet all these valid criticisms from leading organisations who, unlike the government, know what they're talking about were simply ignored.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  Our government is committed to unlocking the jobs of the future, and we're also committed to a future made in Australia. We're doing that right now in regional Queensland. A few weeks ago, I was in Townsville to talk about our future in green energy and our future in manufacturing. Of course, many senators around this chamber would know that Townsville, and particularly regional Queensland, has a proud manufacturing history. Thanks to Labor governments, we build trains in Townsville, we build trains in Maryborough and we have a proud manufacturing history, which means that we have many jobs located in regional Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago, I was at Aurizon, one of the major train organisations there, to talk about an investment that our government is making, a $9.4 million investment through ARENA into Aurizon, Australia's largest freight hauler, and their battery partner Alta Battery Technology, so that those organisations can work together to develop and trial a 1.8-megawatt battery electric tender, also known as a BET. I have to admit I'm used to seeing traditional mechanics and people talking about manufacturing in the traditional way. But this was a really exciting partnership between a green-energy battery company and Aurizon, a haulage company, coming together to develop this new world-first technology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The BET will power a diesel electric locomotive and electric train. Aurizon estimates that the BET could eventually provide up to 50 per cent of the required power for suitable haulage routes, helping to decarbonise the company's haulage. In addition, the BET will be charged with renewable energy to provide energy to the train and further displace diesel use on their trial route.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government, alongside companies like Aurizon in Townsville, is moving the transport sector into the future. These are opportunities that organisations out there, like Aurizon, are taking every day—and, finally, they have a government that's backing them. Taking advantage of low emissions technology is all about creating more jobs, particularly in our regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It isn't just electric trains that our government is backing. A few months ago, I stood alongside the Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy. We were in Townsville again to announce a $70 million investment in developing Townsville 's hydrogen hub—again, an incredible opportunity that we are delivering in regional Queensland, powered by moving towards these green energy opportunities. I spoke last time we were here about this development. The project is a fantastic opportunity for Townsville. It's such a huge win for the community there. Not only will it produce tonnes of green hydrogen per year but it will also create 200 direct jobs. These jobs are opportunities for local sparkies, plumbers, fitters and concreters during the construction, which is set to start next year. This is just one of the places where we're setting up these hydrogen hubs. Another one will also be included in Gladstone, another proud manufacturing town in regional Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're doing this because we know that there's a future in renewables, there's a future in green energy and Australia has the opportunity to be a renewable energy superpower. We're investing in cheaper, cleaner, greener energy and that's what we need to do to unlock the jobs of the future and bring down energy prices for all Queenslanders and all Australians. Over the medium and long term, our government's plan is to support the experts to deliver clean, cheap, reliable and resilient energy systems for all Australians. We know that our plan is critical to delivering reliable and affordable energy into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know and Queenslanders know that under the former government we wasted a decade. We wasted a decade when it came to developing these energy opportunities. The former government had 22 failed energy policies. They were not able to land a single one. Now what are they offering Australians? Instead of talking about building renewables now, instead of talking about delivering jobs now in the regions, those opposite under Peter Dutton are talking about—'possibly', 'maybe', 'sometime in the future', 'maybe in a decade'—building nuclear reactors all down our coastlines, including in a place that is the gateway to the southern Great Barrier Reef. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians don't have another decade to waste. We need cheaper, cleaner energy now. That's why our government is delivering. That's why we're in Townsville announcing green energy jobs today. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263528" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator NAMPIJINPA PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  I stand today very, very distressed at the circumstances that have taken place in my home-town community of Alice Springs. We are in such a dire situation. We have hit absolute crisis point. Leaders from my community, including our mayor, have called for the Northern Territory Labor government to be dissolved and for the federal government to step in. This is how tough it has become. We have hundreds of people rioting in our streets and acting out violently. This is following a spate of violence, crime, death and bashings of 16-year-olds. It was only a couple of days ago that I stood here to condemn traditional cultural payback in my home community and the treatment of young Indigenous women. The violence has escalated to the worst we have ever seen, certainly the worst in my lifetime growing up in Alice Springs. Everybody is saying this in my community; everybody, from all backgrounds and all walks of life, has had enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that this Labor government does not have what it takes to fix the situation in Alice Springs. If they were serious about it, they would have fixed it a long time ago. They would have done it at the outset. They would have done it when we were calling for investment into the primary school that takes care of the most vulnerable kids in our community, kids who are now dying in stolen vehicles on our streets. What more needs to happen? There's a double standard in this country. There's a double standard where the lives of Indigenous Australians mean nothing to this government. You stand up and pretend you care about Indigenous Australians, with all your platitudes, acknowledgements to country and respect for elders past, present and emerging—whatever the hell that means. It means nothing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most marginalised in our community continue to suffer, and now it is bleeding out into the rest of the community. Our businesses are packing up and leaving. Long-term residents are leaving. We have had a gutful. The Territory government must admit they have failed the people of Alice Springs and the Northern Territory. They have to send in the riot squad, the ADF or whoever it takes to bring calm to our streets and to ensure that this crime does not continue. I am telling you now as a Warlpiri woman who has lived life connected to my culture that cultural payback exists. To all the deniers out there, whether it's those in the ABC or whether it's those across the chamber who want to romanticise my culture, this is the culture that I live and that I've lived with all my life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This situation will get worse if it is not dealt with and dealt with immediately. How many more deaths have to occur? Does it matter? They're just Indigenous kids, right? If we had actually acted, instead of not removing Indigenous kids from dysfunctional circumstances, they might not be committing crimes, fast-tracking to incarceration and dying on our streets. The racism is the fact that they are left in dysfunction because there are weak leaders who are more worried about votes than they are about saving lives. I've had a gutful, as has my home town community. Prime Minister Albanese needs to go back to Alice Springs, he needs to deploy the ADF and he needs to have a presence in our community to make the people of Alice Springs feel some sense of safety once and for all. We have all experienced the violence. I have had to physically exert myself and put myself into a violent situation to stop a woman from being bashed. I've done this myself. I've been on the ground. I've been in the dirt. My home has been broken into. The member for Lingiari's home has been broken into.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does it take for some common sense with regard to the rights of Australians? We might be Aboriginal people but we are Australian citizens and we deserve to have the same expectations and the same rights as any other Australian. If this was happening in the streets of Marrickville, I have no doubt that the Minister for Indigenous Australians and our Prime Minister would act very swiftly because, ultimately, their votes would be what's important to them. But we're in the bush. We're out of sight and we're out of mind. Enough is enough. We need help. Do your job, Labor.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="256136" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVID POCOCK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:16</span>):  This morning I had the pleasure of hosting a breakfast with academics, workers, students, the think tank Per Capita and the Australian Services Union to launch a new report and talk about the urgent need to start paying students for compulsory university placements. I recognise the work of fellow senators and members in the other place on this important issue over many years. We need to end placement poverty and we need to end it now. Expecting students to do hundreds of hours, and in some cases over a thousand hours, of unpaid placements—the equivalent of six months unpaid work—is completely unsustainable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard this morning from Eli, a student at Newcastle University, about her and her friends having to skip meals. Students in this country shouldn't go hungry training to be the teachers, nurses, social workers and doctors we so desperately need. Adding to the financial pressures on students, often these placements are required to be undertaken full-time and away from the student's home base. This means additional housing and transport costs and lost income from paid work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, this was recognised in the recent Universities Accord. As you would know, the final report recommended that the Australian government work with higher education providers and employers to introduce payment for unpaid placements including government financial support for placements in the areas of nursing care and teaching. There's an opportunity to start this now. Minister Clare has sent some encouraging signals but on budget night six weeks from now I will be looking to see if this is backed up with immediate funding from the government to start rolling this out in the second half of the year. We talk about the importance of these workers and the importance of more of these workers in the future. Let's back it up with action and look after them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tradies in Australia deserve to be paid for work they've done. Too often and for far too long in this country we see big construction businesses bankroll their operations off the back of subcontractors. Subbies miss out on getting paid when these companies go bust. The rate of insolvencies in Australia continues to climb. In the second half of last year, we saw a 37 per cent increase in insolvencies, and more than a quarter of those were construction businesses. This trend has continued this year. It is particularly acute here in the ACT. Over the last few years, there's been a sharp increase in insolvencies. Two building companies have collapsed in the last week alone. On Tuesday, 10 subcontractors came to parliament to speak up. They're not the first to come here, but I'm hoping that we will begin to listen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is making bold announcements about delivering 1.2 million homes over the next five years. Who's going to build those homes? Who is going to build them if we aren't actually looking after the tradies that build them? Fighting back tears, subbie Antony Lloyd said: 'I'm working very hard and it's taking a very big mental toll on my family and my mental health. It's disgusting. It's just something needs to be done. I call on all the politicians to take me seriously, because you will not have a construction industry, you will not have workers in the industry in years to come.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time someone in this government stood up and took responsibility for this issue and did something about properly protecting subcontractors. They are not asking for special treatment; they are just asking to ensure that they are paid for work they have already done. We've seen the government criminalise wage theft. Where is the movement for tradies? Where is the same urgency, the same bill, that protects tradies' right to simply get paid for work they've already done? It's time that both major parties took this seriously and stood up for tradies across the country. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="300706" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BABET</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">United Australia Party Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  I rise today to speak about the recommendations by the Australian Law Reform Commission on religious discrimination. These recommendations are an egregious attack on people of faith. That's what they are. It must be rejected. All of their recommendations must be rejected by everyone here in this chamber. How dare the ALRC suggest that the state dictate to religious people which views on human sexuality are acceptable and which views are not acceptable? Who died and made the ALRC the Pope? How dare the ALRC encourage politicians to interfere in the staffing of religious organisations, dictating who they can and can't employ? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These recommendations represent a massive overreach by the states. But they are worse than that. They are a full-frontal attack on a human rights. If people are not free to follow their own conscience when it comes to sexuality and gender, then they are not free at all. And if people are not free to associate with those with whom they share common values and ethics, then in what sense does freedom of association exist at all? It doesn't exist. If senators value freedom of religion and freedom of association, they will agree with me that ALRC report No. 142 must be condemned and rejected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party's own statement of belief declares their support for 'freedom of thought, worship, speech and association'. Their statement of belief declares these things to be the most basic freedoms of parliamentary democracy. The ALRC recommendations don't just undermine those basic freedoms; they crucify them. If a Christian school cannot insist that its own staff are practising Christians, then in what sense does that school remain Christian? Would the Greens preselect an SUV-driving oil company executive as a candidate? Of course not, don't be silly. Would the unions appoint a free-market libertarian with a background in entrepreneurship as a shop steward? No, they would not. Would the Australian Pride Network choose a heterosexual Pentecostal who insists there are only two genders to work as their LGBTQIA+ minus sign, divided by sign, exclamation mark liaison manager? We all know the answer to that: they would not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So riddle me this: why are religious organisations singled out for special treatment by the ALRC? It's not a trick question and it does not require us in this place to spend hours talking about it. One-third of Australian families send their kids to religious schools because they value the ethos, ethics and values being taught. The ALRC report would make it illegal for religious schools to uphold their ethics and values. The recommendations, if enacted, would neuter religious schools and deny huge portions of the Australian community their preferred choice of education. It's wrong. It must be rejected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in this chamber all have a set of beliefs—a way in which we see the world. When the government starts insisting that it can frame people's world view, especially on deeply held beliefs like sexuality, gender and marriage, then everyone is in danger. Today it is the Christian world view that is under attack—okay, fair enough—but it is an incredibly naive person who cheers for the interference of government in Christian schooling just because they do not like Christians. Instead, you should be asking: if the government can involve itself in the belief system of Christian organisations, who will be next? Where, if anywhere, will the line between state imposed belief and personal values be drawn?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the ALRC recommendations are not condemned then we are greenlighting government to involve itself in anyone's world view and in anyone's associations. I do not want to live in a world like that—I just don't. Join me in condemning and rejecting the Australian Law Reform Commission report and, in doing so, safeguard the rights of all Australians to their beliefs and to freely associate as they choose.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We stand up and talk about identified problems, but it seems that we never have the real answers to fix them. We stand up in here and talk about housing problems—'Oh, we passed a bill and we didn't even vote for it, but'—as we heard yesterday in the chamber—'how great is it to have a target.' There is no actual expectation that we are going to meet that target, but we've got a target—and 'let's just be happy we've got that'. I have a great target of taking my family on a lovely holiday to Europe and flying first class and taking them to the best places. It is not going to happen. It's just like the housing policy here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The competency to meet the aspirations does not exist with this government on anything. We talked about vaping, and we've got this 'great' bill, where we are banning vaping for the two per cent of vapes that are non-nicotine based. Tell that to the 1.2 million daily users of vapes. Nicotine vapes are already illegal. They are already regulated by the TGA. But another bill will do it! We're not fixing anything. The government is feeling good about themselves that they are talking about fixing a problem. Competency is when stuff happens—when the rubber hits the roads, when things get done—not when we pat ourselves on the back and say, 'What a great job we've done.' There is not enough competency, not enough diligence and not enough action by this government to make Australia a better place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get back to basics. On energy, people want to know that when they turn the power on that it is going to be there and it is not going to cost them their house or their grocery bill for the month to use it. But that is not what we're talking about here; we are talk about how great it is to take up 77 per cent of rural Victoria—to meet their green needs—with windfarms and solar panels and taking the rest of the land to build transmissions lines. Why? They say one megawatt of renewable power is cleaner. But you need three lots of renewable energy to replace one of dispatchable energy by coal, which we currently have. Ninety per cent of our power will disappear over the next nine years, and there is no plan for that. Tomago Aluminium, the biggest electricity user in New South Wales, is close to me in the Hunter Valley. They use 950 megawatts of energy—nearly a gigawatt. They are in the market for green energy. Are they in the market for 950 gigawatts? No, they are not. They are in the market for three gigawatts of renewables because they need that to replace what they have got.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We sit over here and talk about the accountability and the transparency of this government—when you have to sign an NDA to talk to them. We talk about building houses and targets for housing we will never meet. We talk about replacing energy for cheap energy that is not cheaper. Sooner or later, the Australian people will stop worrying about what is being said and will start worrying about what is being done. When that happens, this government will come up so short it won't be funny. At home, we know that things are not easier than they were two years ago. Things are not better than they were two years ago. They've only got harder. They're only going to get worse until there is some transparency, until there is ownership of the problems and we, in this chamber, start taking responsibility for making things better rather than talking about making things better.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You've probably seen the vision on your screens, whether that was a phone or a television screen, but try living it out in everyday life and seeing it right before your eyes. Everywhere in Australia there's been an increase in domestic and family violence. There are little children in Alice Springs throwing big rocks and wielding big, metal bars and young girls and boys in violent fights in the middle of the day in plain sight in schoolyards and on streets, footy fields and public transport. The only people who don't seem to see them are the Albanese government and the ministers responsible.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's people in the Northern Territory, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland. It's impossible to ignore, and the statistics—that's right, the statistics—the data, the evidence back it up. That violence sparks retaliation. Youth crime is out of control, and so is violence. Shame on you, every single one of you, for thinking this is a race issue. This is about children's futures—little children's futures. When you're too busy wandering the streets at night, working out how to create mayhem, you're getting arrested by the police, and you're getting released by the police to do it all again. How's that for a CV when you go for a job? There are no jobs for those kids, because nobody decided to take the tough steps and intervene.</span>

Why aren't the stats improved from what they were before those alcohol restrictions were released?

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  As co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Parkinson's it was my pleasure to host, along with Senator Askew, the National Summit to End Parkinson's disease last night at Parliament House. Parkinson's disease is now the fastest-growing neurological disorder globally. Over 200,000 Australians are currently living with Parkinson's, with this number expected to double by 2040. Currently, there is no cure nor any way to slow it down. There is also no nationally coordinated strategy to tackle this disease—that is to say, until now, with the formation of the National Parkinson's Alliance, launched at last night's summit. For the first time, thanks to the efforts of the National Parkinson's Alliance, we now have a memorandum of understanding between all the states for a comprehensive and collaborative national plan on tackling Parkinson's disease. The significance of this to sufferers of Parkinson's and their loved ones cannot be underestimated. Until now, patients have been subjected to a postcode lottery when it comes to accessing services and support. As we heard last night, even accessing basic information on where to go after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease has sadly, in many cases, been totally lacking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In congratulating the new alliance on their achievements so far, I must acknowledge my fellow Tasmanian Dr Harley Stanton, whose own inspirational journey after being diagnosed with Parkinson's ultimately led to the creation of this new national alliance. Over 80 people attended the summit, including clinicians, researchers, politicians and people living with Parkinson's disease as well the patron of the alliance, the Governor-General, His Excellency General the Hon. David Hurley AC DSC (Retd) and Her Excellency Mrs Linda Hurley.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Amidst the cost-of-living and rental crisis, placement poverty is pushing students to the absolute brink. Saddled with soaring student debt and paying ridiculously high course fees, students also have to struggle with the burden of working hundreds of hours without pay in mandatory placements. Students who are already struggling often have to work all the time to save up for placements. Some have taken a year off university just so they can save up to do a placement. Working around the clock, they are too exhausted to learn and many are forced to drop out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Placements should be designed to benefit student learning, not exploit their labour with onerous hours and conditions without any payment. As James from Students Against Placement Poverty has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Industries are relying on the unpaid labour of students, who are then paying universities for the privilege of being exploited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the most basic expectation that students, like everyone else, are paid for the work that they do. Education is a basic right, and students should be guaranteed a liveable income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another budget is just weeks away, and now is the time for the government to get rid of this really cooked system and implement the Universities Accord recommendations to ensure all student placements are paid. I've long worked alongside students and staff to end placement poverty, and I thank the tireless campaigning of Students Against Placement Poverty, the National Union of Students, the Australian Council of Heads of Social Work Education, the Australian Services Union and many others. The Greens will not stop fighting for students until they are paid for mandatory placements, until all student debt is wiped and until TAFE and university are made free.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  When the votes had stopped being counted, over 64 per cent of South Australians voted no to the national Voice referendum last October. But, despite this, the South Australian state government has pushed ahead with a state based voice comprised of members of smaller bodies, which they legislated prior to the referendum. Elected members of the SA First Nations Voice to Parliament will receive annual stipends from $3,000 to $18,000, sitting fees of $206 per meeting and in some cases a director salary of up to $250,000—that's not bad in a cost-of-living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This will cost South Australian taxpayers $10.3 million over the next four years, while the issues that are faced by Aboriginal South Australians will remain unaddressed. It will just be more highly paid bureaucrats going to team meetings with PowerPoint presentations and a raft of clever buzzwords. And what will the SA voice members do? I suspect there will be a lot more acknowledgements of country and requests for government funding, but not much else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Thomas Sowell once said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You'll never understand bureaucracies until you understand that for bureaucrats procedure is everything and outcomes are nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australians know it too. According to Labor, 26 March of last year was supposed to be a historic moment for SA, marking a special parliamentary sitting day in which members of the public were invited to gather on the steps of parliament to show their support. Barely anyone showed up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, it's evident that most Aboriginal South Australians are not engaged in the process and doubt the SA voice will accomplish anything meaningful. In fact the results of the Far North region show that just recently seven positions were up—three males, three females, one any gender. There were 13 candidates, 305 votes and a quota of 38 to get elected to this ridiculous SA voice. Just like with the national Voice, many Aboriginal people view the SA voice as an irrelevant bureaucratic farce that needs to be repealed.</span>

It's not just a time for us to reflect on the death and resurrection of Jesus; it's also a time for many of us to reflect on the meaning of this event in our own lives. We know that, despite the struggles and suffering which are part of everyone's experience at various stages of life, there is always hope—a hope that's based on the teachings of Jesus rising from the dead.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all love tucking into hot cross buns and chocolates, and some of us big kids at heart might even pinch the occasional chocolate during an Easter egg hunt, as I will this coming weekend, but we wouldn't have the joy of Easter without that cross. The cross does teach us that we have an opportunity to give ourselves to others, just as Jesus did to others as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is evident to my home state of Victoria where the Good Friday Appeal has been raising funds for the Royal Children's Hospital since 1931. The appeal is a sign of the great hope of Easter, with thousands of people volunteering their time—an incredible contribution demonstrating what the power of communities coming together really does mean. And it's all about supporting a wonderful cause.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, as Catholics and many Christians across the world take part in Holy Week, let us hope for a fair and just world for all backgrounds and communities. Let the celebration of Easter bring peace, especially to those who are suffering physically and emotionally. I wish you and your families a happy Easter. Please drive safely on the roads. As we say in our family: 'Buona pasqua a tutti'—Happy Easter to you all.</span>

Labor and its allies, the coalition and the Greens, are rushing nine laws through the Senate today with no debate or scrutiny, and One Nation opposed all of them on this basis. One of them has horrifying consequences for our future and our freedom: the Digital ID Bill 2024. This law is designed to control the Australian people. It's a step towards the 15-minute cities already being imposed in the United Kingdom, heavily penalising anyone trying to travel outside their community. This is a secretive international effort to establish a one-world government with no freedom and no capacity for dissent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's never forget how easily Australian governments imposed restrictions on us during the pandemic. We couldn't go anywhere without a digital vaccination certificate. Our freedom of speech was suppressed by government and by tech, and it continues in social media content.

In doing so, Councillor Brough essentially asked the council to satisfy itself that there are no persons connected with the Albany event that would support the views of some pride event organisers in other jurisdictions around the world who advocate for minor-attracted persons to be included as a supported group as part of the LGBTQIA+ community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following this, the ABC in its reporting ran the headline 'Albany councillor Thomas Brough slammed for homophobic comments during week of pride'. The ABC selectively presented Councillor Brough's comments to provide a very lopsided and misleading characterisation of an otherwise upstanding councillor that Albany constituents can be proud of. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Albany Advertiser</span> continued the vilification by publishing an opinion piece from a gay activist on 14 March which falsely asserts that Councillor Brough was blaming gays for child sexual abuse, even though the ABC and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Albany Advertiser</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>have been provided with evidence that there are numerous LGBTQIA+ activists such as Professor Gary Dowsett, who was the deputy director of the Australian Research Centre on Sex, Health and Society for 22 years, who have openly campaigned for adults having sexual relations with consenting children to be normalised and viewed as just another sexual orientation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Councillor Brough has every right to raise concerns from his constituents who are concerned with the ever-advancing march of the radical left. However, in no way was Councillor Brough attempting to disparage members of the LGB community. He was simply raising the concerns that his constituents have shared.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  I'm proud to be a member of a government that believes in science and especially one that supports women in science. In today's tech driven world, STEM skills are vital, and that's why our government initiated the diversity in STEM review, which is aimed at eliminating barriers in STEM education and workplaces and at addressing the gender pay gap. Recently I met women leading the charge in STEM. Doctors Marina Jelinic and Sarah Lensen are driving progress in cardiovascular biology and IVF research, while doctors Emma Watson and Victoria Wansink are making strides in medicinal chemistry and microbiology respectively. We spoke about the challenges of doing your PhD and juggling a competitive career field with care-giving duties. The dedication of these fantastic women is driving progress, shaping our future and highlighting the talent we have right here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to boosting diversity in STEM, creating more opportunities for Australians to thrive in well-paid roles. But, despite progress, only 15 per cent of STEM jobs are held by women. So it's great to see the National Health and Medical Research Council meet its 50-50 funding targets through the Investigator Grants program, giving more women the opportunity to excel in research. There is still so much more to do. We need to keep challenging stereotypes surrounding STEM careers, and Labor is committing to do just that. We are pushing for diversity and inclusion, crucial steps in building a strong, homegrown, STEM workforce. Our vision is clear: we are crafting a future, made in Australia, powered by innovation and enriched by the diverse talents of our workforce. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  World Water Day was on  March 22, a global event to celebrate water and to raise awareness of the two billion people living without access to safe water. The theme for 2024 was 'water for peace', focusing on the critical role that water plays in the stability and prosperity of the world. We understand water to be intrinsically linked to Indigenous women's safety, wellness and leadership. Water is necessary for human survival, but for First Nations communities it holds spiritual and cultural significance as well. It is a living spirit, sacred to First Nations people because it gives life and it is used in many ceremonies. First Nations women have traditional and inherent roles as water carriers and protectors of traditional lands and waterways. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a proud First Nations woman, I understand that making real systemic change and ensuring First Nations women's safety always begins with water, land and ceremony. As stewards of the land and the waterways, we are at the forefront of that action. The right to safety for water protectors must be insured at all levels of government, whether it is local, state, national or international. Throughout history, Indigenous women have cared for the environment, our Mother Earth, because we know that when she is safe and well and at peace so too are we. Our teachings show that we are part of the environment and the world around us, not separate from it. We must restore harmony and live in balance with Mother Earth because we are all related and we are all responsible for caring for her. Just as our ancestors ensured that our lands and waters were cared for, we must ensure that we are cared for and restore balance with Mother Earth for each of us and for our grandchildren's children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations women lead differently. We lead from the heart. We lead from the community perspective, embedding cultural understandings and Indigenous world views from the ground up. As First Nations women, we strive to protect First Nations women's safety and the safety of our Mother Earth, grounded in the strength of our culture, and we strive to continue the healing and wellness that ceremony, land and water-based practices bring. </span>

And it has never met a tax it did not want to take home. Of course, the Australian public do not take kindly to being cheated on. Retaining the affection of the people means that you have to be subtle about your multiple affairs with levies, excises, duties, tolls and, of course, taxes. The Prime Minister and his Treasurer have become experts at denying the taxation lipstick on their collar. They will look the Australian people straight in the eye, promising to do good, while reaching around behind them and stealing their wallets out of their back pockets. They will protest that, 'Our plan hasn't changed', by which they mean they are not yet ready to announce their changed plans. They will insist, 'That is not on the table', which we know means that it is being hidden under the table for a more opportune time. </span>

                  </a>  Exactly. They never pick up the bill. The public does not believe the PM's promises of fidelity. No-one takes seriously his commitment or faithfulness. Soon the Australian people will kick this unfaithful government to the kerb to seek another that they can trust. But can they really trust the Labor Party? Can they trust my friends to the Right here? I don't know about that one, because, you know what? They are also economic vandals. Hopefully they can do better next time around.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I stand here today as a proud foundation member of the Tasmania Football Club and very proud to wear the badge of that football club on my lapel. I would like to lend my congratulations to Grant O'Brien and his team on the board for such a successful launch last week. All things in my office stopped last week at 6 pm to watch the launch of the club and the launch of the foundation membership, which at the price of $10 is pretty good deal—although I did option up and go for the $15 version and got all four stickers; I'm a big spender! Mind you, there are 10 other members of my household who also have memberships, unlike so many others, but there are now close to 170,000 people who have joined the club. I think that's an extraordinary signal of how important people around this country—and 46 other nations, I might add—see Tasmania's entry into the AFL.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now it's important for us to do all the things to ensure that our team has the best possible chance and facilities to be successful. I want to liken where the AFL club is today to the JackJumpers, Tasmania's new third-year team in the National Basketball League. They play tomorrow night in the third game of the series for the championship. We clearly wish them all the best. There was controversy when there was money spent on their new stadium in Hobart, and today you can't get a ticket. I would urge Tasmanians to back Tassie, to back the team and to back support for the new facilities.</span>

When I was there earlier this month, there were 190 stores and thousands of people. It's not a tourist market; it's a community market. People travel from all over the region to visit, shop and meet up with friends. I set up a stall, because I'm one of their friends, so people can have their say. They can pop a ball into a tube to show what issues they would fix if they had a magic wand. The tubes for housing, cost of living and health were overflowing by the end of the day. I met Michael, a young bloke who has to wait nine months to see a psychiatrist for help, with a severe mental health condition. I spoke with Shirley, a retired lady with several chronic health conditions. She has difficulties getting medical appointments when she needs them. And there was Kate, a mum who is desperate because her autistic son is falling behind at school. The teacher is managing a large classroom with no support and has no time for her son's specific needs. Our friend Annabelle travelled down from Latrobe to give us all cupcakes. Thanks, Annabelle; you are the best! </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the basics people that want to talk about. They want us to understand that politicians and bureaucrats are letting them down. They want to talk about the daily struggle to put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads; about getting a good education and good start in life for their kids; about getting to see a GP—the basics on which we all rely. </span>

The people I spoke to want to see politicians working together to fix issues. They want to feel like they are being heard and listened to. At least, that's what the people at the Exeter market tell me. Guess what? I listened. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  In the latest Tasmanian election Jacqui Lambie Network candidates ran on transparency and integrity. What we learned is that Tasmanians do not trust the Liberal and Labor parties anymore. If you look at the results of the last federal election, I don't think Australians trust the major parties either. Independent candidates who ran on integrity and transparency were elected in record numbers. This government ran on accountability and transparency and integrity. You promised the Australian people that if they voted for you you would deliver. All we have seen here since you were elected is bills being rammed through with little or no consultation—as usual, dropping it on us at the last minute. When the Tasmanian Liberals were attacking the Labor opposition leader for not revealing whom she spoke to about the AFL stadium, the Attorney-General of Tasmania, Guy Barnett, said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Hiding behind the pretence of confidentiality simply doesn't cut it. This is about honesty. This is about integrity. This is about telling the truth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He actually managed to say this with a straight face. What Mr Barnett didn't say was that it was his government that signed a deal with the AFL under the cover of darkness. They didn't consult with Treasury, TasWater or key stakeholders. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also the Tasmanian Liberal government who fought tooth and nail to prevent the Tasmanian people from knowing which 22 people and eight institutions face potential adverse findings by the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, back in the federal parliament, the Albanese Labor government has resisted multiple freedom of information requests to disclose the Prime Minister's diary. The Labor government that was promising integrity and transparency is getting stakeholders to sign an unprecedented number of non-disclosure agreements, and this means that the government will show these stakeholders legislation but they're not allowed to discuss it with anyone else. I would recommend to every Liberal and Labor MP that you go to bed every night with a copy of the 2022 election results. Remember that was your lowest primary vote yet, and there'll be more to come if you continue on this road. </span>

Well, I've got news for Minister O'Neil. Our job as the Senate—as a house of review and scrutiny—is not just to come in here like a herd of sheep and vote for her legislation simply because she presented it.

Minister O'Neil, during her work experience in my office, can actually come along to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and see how that committee scrutinises legislation and how it impacts the rights and liberties of everyday Australians. </span>

From King Island to Arnhem Land and down to Victor Harbor, these 10 new study hubs are part of our $66.9 million commitment to increase access to university by establishing more hubs across Australia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lack of access is something that is often raised with me when I'm travelling throughout regional Queensland, so I'm thrilled that Longreach, Innisfail, Warwick and Chinchilla are all set to have hubs established within their town over the next 12 months. The education reforms that Labor pursued in the 1980s and 1990s boosted the number of students finishing high school from 40 per cent to almost 80 per cent. Now, the Albanese government seeks to do the same with our tertiary sector. The Universities Accord report recommends that 80 per cent of the workforce will need a university or VET qualification by 2050. We're currently sitting at 60 per cent. The report made it clear that, if we're going to have the workforce of the future, we need to hit that 80 per cent target. These graduates won't just come from the cities or suburbs. If they do, we won't hit that target. We need students in our regions to study, graduate and continue to live there, and that starts with improving access through our Regional University Study Hubs network. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're a student from the regions, you're not only less likely to finish high school but also you're less likely to go to TAFE or university. In our cities almost one in two young people in their 20s and 30s have a university degree. These hubs are the first step in our plan to bridge this gap in opportunity. They reaffirm our government's belief that everyone deserves a world-class education, no matter who they are or where they live. An Albanese government will be rolling out 10 more of these regional university study hubs in country areas and 14 in suburban areas.</span>

In a press conference on 25 November 2022, the Prime Minister said: 'We're operating as a mature, orderly government.' Minister, this week the government has tried to rush through new immigration laws with virtually no scrutiny, is engaging in secret and opaque consultation processes on religious discrimination legislation and has tried to paper over its disastrous family car tax aimed at the country's top-selling vehicles. Minister, how is this chaos and dysfunction consistent with operating as a mature, orderly government?</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, President. As I said, it does say something, doesn't it, when you have the Dutton opposition lining up with Mr Bandt and Senator Cash lining up with Senator Shoebridge in order to fail to ensure that Australians are kept safe. So let us be clear, because I know there are those who are more sensible on that side—I know there are—that what Senator Cash and Mr Dutton, in their desire to team up with the Greens, have done is make sure you are standing in the way of us making Australians safer. That is what you are doing. So I want to be crystal clear about this.</span>

I know that you are standing in the way because you think you will win a political fight of Australians being safer. So let us be clear: that is what you are doing. And after you get out of this place and after all of the flurry of victory with the Greens has faded, the hard reality is that the Liberal Party and the National Party are standing in the way of Australians being more safe. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But if I might finish the response on religious discrimination—because it's a serious topic, and it's an issue which was difficult inside the coalition, and I acknowledge Senator Sharma and others, including in the other place, and former members who took a position of conscience on those issues. These are challenging issues that need to be addressed respectfully and carefully, and we are seeking to do that. And I would remind you, Senator Cash, that you were part of a government that failed to deliver on religious discrimination precisely because you were not prepared to deal with it in a dignified and principled and respectful way, and you sought to play politics, just as you are now and as we know you always will, Senator Cash. You and Mr Dutton—we know that you will always go the lowest bit of the road whenever you can. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Today's monthly consumer price index indicator shows inflation remains steady at 3.4 per cent in the year to February 2024. So, Minister, this number demonstrates that the government are making progress in our fight against inflation. Can the minister please outline to the Senate why these numbers are an important marker of how our economy is tracking? How will the numbers factor into considerations that you and the government are undertaking as you finalise the May budget?</span>

We can see from today's monthly CPI data that it does show that inflation was steady at 3.4 per cent in the year to February 2024. This was below market expectation, and inflation remains at its lowest level in over two years. So we are seeing inflation moderate and continue to moderate. We've got real wages growing. We've got low unemployment. Monthly inflation is much lower than the 6.1 per cent it was at the election, and quarterly inflation is now at 0.6 per cent, a third of the 2.1 per cent we saw just before the election. This data shows that inflation was higher under the former government and it continues to moderate under us. We are seeing—</span>

Our budget will be one that balances the fight against inflation with the need to grow our economy; it will look at continued relief from cost-of-living measures without adding to inflation; it will, of course, have those tax cuts rolling out from 1 July; and we'll be looking at the opportunities, whether it be in energy transformation, human capital or the care economy, with a focus on investment for a new generation of growth and prosperity. </span>

Cost-of-living pressures are front of mind for Australians. You and the Treasurer have said that the tax cuts will form the centrepiece of the May budget, putting more of the money that people earn back into their own pockets. How will the federal budget continue to support Australians facing pressures on their household budgets?</span>

The senator is right: Labor's tax cuts will be the centrepiece of the May budget. All Australian taxpayers will get a tax cut, because we want Australians to keep more of what they earn. However, we also recognise that cost-of-living pressures are still being felt right around the country, and we will do what we can responsibly in the May budget to support and ease some of those cost-of-living pressures.</span>

In the senator's state of Western Australia, 1.5 million Western Australians will get a tax cut from 1 July under Labor's tax plan, with 1.2 million of them getting a bigger tax cut. Ninety per cent of Western Australian women who are taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut. The average WA taxpayer will receive a tax cut of $1,504, which provides an additional $800 extra into their pocket than they would have received under the former government's plan.</span>

We have gross debt lower than when the Liberals were in charge; we have real spending growth lower; inflation is lower; and, of course, we have delivered the first budget surplus in 15 years.</span>

As we conclude this parliamentary session, the last before the budget week, Australians continue to do it tough under the Albanese government. Under Labor, productivity is down 5.4 per cent over the past 18 months; real net disposable income per capita has fallen 7.5 per cent; personal income tax collection under Labor is 23 per cent higher than it was before the election; income from self-employment has fallen by 8.4 per cent over the year; almost one million Australians are now working two or three jobs; petrol prices are up 4.1 per cent for the year; education costs are up 5.1 per cent; and insurance costs are up 16.5 per cent—while Labor keeps spending more. Minister, as these figures demonstrate, life isn't easy under Mr Albanese and it's getting harder for many. Why are Australians worse off today than they were before the last election?</span>

We understand that Australians are doing it tough, which is why we wanted to put in place energy price relief, and we were opposed in that by you. We understand Australians are doing it tough, which is why we believe that people on minimum wages should have a wage increase—also opposed by you. We know Australians are doing it tough, which is why we wanted cheaper child care and fee-free TAFE and to strengthen Medicare and to strengthen bulk-billing and all of the measures that we have in place. Instead, what we are met with is continued opposition by those opposite. They are crocodile tears which are being cried on the other side. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

A secret legal agreement has allowed PwC International to take control of PwC Australia following the tax leaks scandal. We've learned that, for nine months now, five faceless global figures have exercised sweeping powers over the Australian firm that we were not even aware of. PwC International is hiding critical information from the parliament about who did what in the PwC scandal, making a mockery of our Senate committees and escaping real accountability. We must bring these shadowy partnerships to account and hold PwC accountable for its actions. What steps will your government take to address this appalling and disrespectful treatment of the parliament and the Australian people?</span>

I think initially I would say to you that the government is very interested in the work that the Senate committees are doing and is looking forward to your report and any recommendations that you have. I would say that there are, as the Senate is aware, powers within the committees to seek information, and of course I'd leave it to the committee to look at whether there is any further work that they can do there.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to what the government is doing, we have been doing quite a lot of work to strengthen some of our arrangements around engagement of consulting firms. We've talked about this at estimates. I think we have learnt a lot, through the PwC issue that's being examined by various Senate committees, of further work that we need to do. I would say that some of the origins of the investigations are related to a breach of a confidentiality arrangement, not a breach of procurement processes, but what it has done is lead us to look at what further work we can do to strengthen integrity within our procurement processes around the use of consultants and contractors. We've been doing that through our strategic commissioning framework and through our efforts to reduce the reliance on consultants and contractors. Some of the further arrangements that we're looking at are in relation, I think, to some of the issues that have arisen out of confidentiality and out of conflict-of-interest arrangements that may exist that we are doing further work on. We are very much looking forward to the report and to the recommendations that are going to come forward from your various inquiries.</span>

We're not looking at banning them. PwC is an individual company or contractor. We are interested, in a general sense, in looking at how we can enhance the integrity of the engagement the Commonwealth has with suppliers, and we are developing a Commonwealth supply code of conduct. That will outline the behavioural standards that are expected from suppliers during procurement processes and while under contract. This is something that we're looking at prospectively. Some of the work that was done around the original PwC and Tax Practitioners Board issue, and the advice taken through that, was not about being able to end any contract with PwC. That wasn't available to the Commonwealth.</span>

He is correct. At the Osborne naval shipyards last week, the Deputy Prime Minister and I were joined by counterparts from the United Kingdom, by Ambassador Kennedy and by Premier Malinauskas. We announced that the government has appointed ASC and BAE Systems as our sovereign submarine partners to build Australia's AUKUS submarines.

There will be some 4,000 Australian jobs in the design phase and construction of the yard for the new submarine and 5½ thousand during the build of the submarines. Over the next years we estimate that over $30 billion will be invested in Australia's industry to deliver AUKUS. Our build and sustainment strategy is a further step in the Albanese government's commitment not only to strategic strength but also to a future made in Australia.</span>

We do live in a much more challenging strategic environment, and responsible governments do have to look at the best way to ensure Australia's interest in a rapidly changing world. Our belief is that Australia is best served where we have strategic balance or strategic equilibrium in our region. We are also always motivated to seek peace and stability in our region. In that vein, we are open and transparent about our acquisition of nuclear-powered conventionally armed submarines, and, as the IAEA director general has welcomed, we believe these submarines will transform our ability to deter or respond to any future threats and, most importantly, to change the calculus for any potential aggressor. Strategic balance means we must ensure that no country will ever assume that the benefits of conflict outweigh the risks. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We all want to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific in a region which is peaceful, stable and prosperous, and the AUKUS submarines, by design, will incorporate technology from all three nations. Australia's military and civilian personnel will embed with the US Navy and Royal Navy, and, through pillar 2, AUKUS partners are deepening cooperation on a range of security and defence capabilities. We are working together to ensure each nation is equipped to defend against rapidly evolving threats. We are pleased, very appreciative, of them being able to take place in Australia, particularly the visit to Adelaide. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  If it is the religious discrimination act—and I assume, given previous discussions, it is—the advice I have is this. Obviously there's been a long discussion on religious discrimination. Since 2016, there have been 10 inquiries, over 260 hearings and consultations, and 70,000 submissions. I understand that there have been targeted and confidential consultations, which is not an unusual process. The advice I have in the brief that I've been provided with is that no stakeholder has been asked to sign an NDA in relation to the religious discrimination bill. No stakeholder has been asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement. If I'm incorrect on that and on the advice I've received, I'll certainly come back to the chamber.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a difficult bill. As you know, it has had a long period of discussion. These matters were raised by Prime Minister Turnbull, I think, originally and then by Prime Minister Morrison as well. We are conscious of the importance, on something such as religious discrimination, of trying to engage in this discussion in a way which is respectful and in which we seek to bring Australians together.</span>

If you were referring to the nature positive bill—which, I think, is the EPBC reform—I understand that consultation on drafts of the new laws is continuing and that there is a broad view. We need to deal with laws which are seen by many as ineffective and inefficient—obviously, people's perspective depends on which side they are in that discussion. The advice I have is that experts from almost 100 groups are examining draft parts of the legislation to make sure that the laws will be as effective as possible, and we will keep engaging with— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In February last year the Prime Minister announced $250 million to improve community safety in Central Australia. In February this year we learned that $10 million of that funding had been allocated for better digital connectivity in Central Australia. Minister, how did better wi-fi help protect the Alice Springs community last night?</span>

Obviously, Senator Gallagher might be in a position to answer in a little more detail in relation to this matter. Can I say first that violence has no place in any community in any part of Australia. The Prime Minister and the government work in partnership with the Northern Territory government, and our expectation is that that perspective—that violence is unacceptable in any community—is something that all of us can work towards.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the Prime Minister has engaged with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and emphasised the importance of prioritising community safety. When it comes to broader issues facing Central Australia, I think—as you would know, Senator Nampijinpa Price—there are no quick fixes and no simple solutions. We have a four-year plan to improve community safety and wellbeing in Central Australia which was developed with the Aboriginal leadership group who are providing advice to the government on what will improve outcomes in Central Australia. We want to see action in partnership with the community and long-term solutions to health, education, jobs, housing and justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the specific question about, I think, a program that had been announced and why a decision was made to allocate some of that to connectivity, I will seek advice and, if I have something further to add, I will return to the chamber or provide that advice to you. But I would say this to you: obviously connectivity is a very important part of enabling economic development and enabling the provision of services. I think we see in many parts of regional Australia that lesser connectivity leads to poorer outcomes, both social and economic. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Last week it was revealed by Channel 7's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightly</span> that telecommunications companies in Victoria are charging for information desperately needed by police to search for murdered Victorian mother Samantha Murphy. Not only were they charging the police for this information; they were delaying passage of it to the police. A former homicide detective told <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Nightly</span> that police face financial, legal and technical barriers in their attempts to access phone data. The Victorian shadow police minister said: 'Delays in investigations are devastating to the families of victims and to think anyone is profiting while families suffer is appalling.' A mother is missing, and the telcos are charging the police to help find her. How shameful is that? Is the minister aware that the telecommunications companies are slow to deliver vital data that could help with police investigations?</span>

I am aware of the reports that you are referring to. If those reports are true, that would of course be of great concern, I think, to all Australians. The Australian government is committed to keeping Australians safe, including working with law enforcement and working with industry to achieve that. The information provided by telecommunication carriers to emergency services is essential to keeping people safe from harm and supporting investigations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Lambie, as you may be aware, there is an ability for telecommunications companies to recover the costs of providing this kind of information. That ability is provided for under the Telecommunications Act. But it's limited in the sense that telecommunications carriers or carriage service providers cannot profit from the data they provide. So they are legally allowed to recover the cost of providing that information but they can't profit from that. I think that is something that all Australians would agree with. This cost recovery model has a long-established framework in telecommunications law in our country. The Albanese government certainly expects telecommunication providers to support our emergency services and our police services in these kinds of investigations. We encourage them to provide information as soon as possible to support their needs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think all of us have been very disturbed by this particular incident. It must be horrible for Ms Murphy's family to have to go on, day by day, without her body being found. It is an extremely distressing incident not only for her family but for many others as well, and we would certainly be encouraging telecommunications providers to assist the police investigation in any way they possibly can.</span>

In 2022 the Western Australian Commissioner of Police, Col Blanch, revealed telco fees for this crucial data had risen from $600,000 in the 2018-19 financial year to $1 million over a period of 12 months. Tasmania Police said they had spent $90,000 on requests for data from telcos last financial year. The bottom line is that you have a problem here, and I want to know how you're going to fix it. How are you going to fix it? They are obstructionists in an investigation. Your method is not working. How are you going to fix it? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Again, I understand that this has been reported in the media. I just want to be cautious about accepting that that is absolutely correct. But, if it is correct, as I say, that is of real concern to us. I've already made clear that our government expects telecommunications providers to cooperate with police investigations, to supply whatever data they have available to them to assist with that and to follow the law in terms of what they charge for that. Under the Telecommunications Act, telecommunications providers are required to provide assistance to the Commonwealth, states and territories, and they are required to provide such help as is reasonably necessary for certain purposes, which includes enforcing the criminal law. As I've explained, under the act providers must comply with that requirement on the basis that they neither profit from nor bear the costs of assisting those investigations. We expect the law to be upheld. We expect telecommunications providers to comply with the law. </span>

As I said, the Albanese government expects telecommunications providers to comply with the law. Whatever action can be taken under the Telecommunications Act will be taken to ensure that that is the case. I must admit, I haven't seen anything in terms of what has been reported regarding telecommunications providers overcharging for that data. If there is any evidence that that is the case, then I would invite you to present that to us so that action can be taken. As you have noted, Senator Lambie, under the act, providers are entitled to recover their costs of providing that data, but they are not entitled to profit from that data.  If it is the case that they are profiting from it, we would be very interested in knowing about that, whether it is information that you have—media outlets or others as well—so that the appropriate action can be taken. </span>

As Senator Wong outlined today already, the Albanese government has taken a range of actions to assist Australians to deal with cost-of-living pressures—whether that is cheaper child care, cheaper medicine or the energy price relief that the opposition voted against. We've got the tax cuts coming in on 1 July. But another cost-of-living measure that we're taking is providing fee-free TAFE. I think that is one of the unsung heroes in terms of the cost-of-living relief that we've provided since coming to office. Fee-free TAFE means that students no longer will have big study related debts once they finish and, because courses are in areas of demand, they will go into long-term and secure work. We've seen a high uptake in nursing, early childhood education and care, community and individual care, electrotechnology, electrical cybersecurity and IT, to name just a few of the careers that people are taking up through those fee-free TAFE options. That's giving Australians access to education and providing the skills that we need.</span>

I will come to the tax cuts, but it has just occurred to me that maybe we need to offer another fee-free TAFE course, and that is in how to do some work in opposition! We know that this is a group that clearly doesn't have the skills or the work ethic to get a job, and that's why, in all the time that they've been in opposition, they've only come up with one policy and that's to put in place nuclear reactors all over the country. Aren't we seeing them all walk away slowly from that one? Maybe a new fee-free TAFE course will assist you to get the skills that you need!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Albanese Labor government, there are more people in jobs, they're earning more and, with our tax plan, they'll keep more of what they earn. Remember what I was saying yesterday? Under the Albanese Labor government, workers get to earn more and keep more of what they earn. Under the Liberals, what happens? They work more and earn less. You will learn the words before long, because it's true. You know it's true, and that's why you ended up voting for our tax cuts—although, from what Senator Birmingham had to say today, we're not so sure anymore.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard minister after minister get up and respond to questions that were put by coalition senators about cost of living, the riots in Alice Springs last night and the failure of the Prime Minister to lead a mature government. What did we get from this Labor Party? We got arrogance. We had the arrogance of a government who have been in power for almost two years and have started to believe their own press releases written by their own media and press advisers, because they've started to think that what they are doing is quite good. Guess what? It isn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Any politician who leaves Canberra and spends some time on the road—as coalition senators do, day after day, going around their states listening to and living with their constituents—knows that the No. 1 issue impacting upon Australians today is cost of living. Cost of living are the three words that this Labor Party government did not mention at all last year. Cost of living did not come into the lexicon of the modern Labor Party until the Voice referendum happened. When that got rejected, suddenly some focus groups were conducted by the Labor Party and they discovered cost of living was the No. 1 issue in Queensland and in Australia. I can tell you, as someone who was on pre-poll for days on days and was in Brisbane on polling day and for the by-elections, the No. 1 issue in Queensland is cost of living. The message that was sent to the Labor Party on the cost of living was a pretty strong one. In Ipswich, the seat of Ipswich West fell to the Liberal National Party. There was a 22 per cent swing in the very, very, very safe seat of Inala, a fiefdom of the Labor Party that was almost taken by our brilliant LNP candidate running there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's happened is that Queenslanders and Australians are turning on the Labor Party. They're turning on the left wing, because they know that this Labor Party made a lot of promises before the last election. Remember that they were going to cut your power bills by $275, a promise that was made by the Prime Minister 97 times? Put your hands up, Australia, and put your hands up, Queensland, if your power bill has gone down by $275. No-one has put their hand up. Not even the Labor Party benches put their hand up, because power bills have gone up. So, for those who are listening at home, your power bills have not gone down by $275; they've gone up by 10, 15, 20 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queenslanders and Australians are living and experiencing a cost-of-living crisis at the moment, and what do we have from Labor Party? We have platitudes, and we have the arrogance of this executive, this executive of the Labor Party government who fail to understand or appreciate how tough it is in Queensland at the moment. Queenslanders have to deal with a state Labor government and a federal Labor government. Think about the people living in Townsville who have got a crime crisis, a health crisis and a cost-of-living crisis; but guess what? The people living in Townsville are not by themselves, because those crises are in Cairns, Cunnamulla and in Warwick, where I live. They're in the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane. Queenslanders are being let down by the Labor Party. Australians are being let down by the Labor Party, because we have a Labor Party who are just not up to the job of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the flip-flops. We know where the Labor Party cabinet meets; it meets in the flip-flop section of Kmart, because they're all choosing which flip-flops they're going to wear: the pink ones, the blue ones, the ones with little spikes on them. This is a government of flip-flops, backflips and dilly-dallying. They are a government who are not up to the job of governing. I say, why don't you call an election? Let's have an election now. Let's get on with it and have a vote on whether you understand the cost-of-living crisis that is hurting Australia at the moment. </span>

They have no plan when they come in here, other than to inflict chaos in their own debate. Far from a real policy critique, we had a discussion of flip-flops in the Kmart section. This is not substantive policy critique on the real issues facing Australians. But as a mature and orderly government, under Anthony Albanese—in the question asked by Senator Cash, Senator Cash quoted the Prime Minister from November 2022 as saying just that. But personally I have heard the Prime Minister make that very same statement dozens of times, rightfully so, since that time. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time I see and meet with the Prime Minister and the cabinet, be that in the caucus meeting, out in the community, in the parliament and electorates or in every place where we see him and the government, I see a laserlike focus on the cost of living, wages, controlling inflation, the cost of medication, bringing the cost of visiting a doctor down, our energy rebates and education. Whether it's the religious freedom debate, education, cars or energy, we are working through the significant issues that confront our nation. We're bringing them forward and bringing the Australian people with us. We are deliberating carefully through orderly processes, which, quite often, those opposite don't want to come to the party on. When it comes to a mature and orderly government dealing with the issue of religious discrimination, for example, it will be much more orderly if Mr Dutton comes to the party in having a real discussion with government about what we can agree on. Whether it is the cost-of-living summit, tax cuts, energy, Medicare, cheaper medicines, the energy transition or delivering the first budget surplus in many years, we take these decisions carefully. They are methodical decisions that are well deliberated on.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Day after day, we come into this place dedicated to and focused on delivering outcomes for the Australian people, despite the fact that what we are rewarded with from those opposite, in their representation of the Australian people, is references to flip-flops from Kmart, disorder and chaos. There's no plan and no alternative policy agenda, just the usual politics that we see from those opposite, seeking to promulgate chaos and division. It is their core political tactic, and it is a far cry from the level of policy critique and debate that our nation deserves. Frankly, all governments benefit from policy critique when they have a good opposition that is deeply involved in the policy discussions and debate, able to mount a clear alternative policy and able to debate the issues before the Australian people. But, no, all those opposite do is oppose and divide.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  Senator Pratt talked about flip-flops in Kmart. Senator Pratt is a dedicated senator, so I'm sure she wasn't doing online shopping during question time. Maybe she read some government briefs and saw the term 'flip-flop' there. It seems that it's almost part of every government brief that they can't stick to what they said before the last election. Maybe they were a bit confused when they came to government and so at the top of every brief it says, 'Make sure we flip-flop today, because we can't stick to the commitments we made in opposition.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go through some of the Labor government flip-flops, which Senator Pratt spoke about so eloquently. They promised to keep people safe, particularly in relation to border security. Well, we can all see what the government has done in that area. There's the infamous $275 cut to power bills. Every Australian knows that their power bills have soared over the last two years, so that was another nice flip-flop from the Labor Party. They promised—committed—that Australians were going to be better off. As Senator Birmingham clearly pointed out in his question to the minister, a family with a $750,000 mortgage has now seen costs increase by $22,000 dollars per annum. At the same time, what have we seen happen to income tax receipts? They've gone up 23 per cent under this Labor government. What is that caused by? That is caused by the insidious effects of inflation and bracket creep—inflation that I think this government actually wants to see stay a bit higher for a bit longer because, over time, it will deflate their debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other examples of flip-flops and broken promises. We've seen the stage 3 tax cuts, in relation to which the Prime Minister's word 'was his bond'. Of course, we know where that went. They promised cheaper mortgages. I've just talked about that. For a $750,000 mortgage held by an average Australian family, costs have increased by $22,000. They promised no increase in the tax burden, but that has gone up by 23 per cent. The Labor Party promised no changes to superannuation, but they've attacked self-managed super funds particularly. For the first time in Australia's history, unrealised capital gains are being taxed within a super fund. This is going to impact particularly on Australian farmers and small-business owners who have chosen to put part of their income generating asset—their farm or perhaps an office they work out of—into, as is quite legal and proper, their self-managed super fund. So, for the first time in Australia's history, if there is an uplift in the value of an asset to take individuals above the $3 million cap, suddenly an unrealised gain—a paper profit—is going to be taxed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The flip-flops just keep on going. They promised that franking credits wouldn't be touched, and they promised that industrial relations bargaining wouldn't be industrywide. They said: 'No, we wouldn't go there. We wouldn't go back to pattern bargaining. We wouldn't go back to the bad old days of the seventies and eighties.' But of course they do. As Senator Pratt acknowledged, they flip-flop. There are so many commitments that those opposite made before the last election and have walked away from in government—commitments which the Australian people thought meant something and which the Australian people relied on in making their decision. Commitment after commitment after commitment has been walked away from by this Labor government. We will continue to hold them to account, and we will continue to tell the Australian people what this Labor government is doing to them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I think it's important, when we come into the chamber, that we are forthright in our views, but I think it's really important that we actually put the facts on the record. It's not that the government has only just discovered the cost of living. We have been putting forward legislation and policies to help Australian families. We recognise that there has been an increase in the cost of living and the impact of that. What those opposite failed to tell you is that, when they were in government, their policy was to keep wages low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we've come to government, we've raised Australian wages. We've actually ensured that we are doing all that we can, by setting legislative frameworks, to close the disparity in pay between women in the workforce and their male counterparts who do the same job. We have achieved the lowest gender pay gap on record in this country. Unemployment is now at 3.7 per cent. Let's not forget that every single measure that we've put forward—like cheaper medicines, energy relief and 60-day prescriptions, all of those things which have a direct impact on the family budget—has been opposed by those opposite every single time. When it came to cheaper child care, they opposed it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are about strengthening Medicare because it's a universal health system that is worth protecting, but the unfortunate thing is that it relies purely and solely on having a Labor government to ensure that those on that side don't erode it. We have given more relief to GPs so more people can get to see their GP. Those on that side have no credibility when it comes to the economy. They sing their own praises, but in the last budget it was a Labor government which brought in the first surplus in such a very long time. Those opposite kept promising a surplus when they were in government, for 10 years, but they failed to deliver one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good senator before me talked about tax cuts. You show me an Australian that is not getting a bigger tax cut and that is opposed to the changes that we made. We did that after close consideration of the economic circumstances, the interest rates and the cost-of-living crisis. We are actually giving more Australians a bigger tax cut. We believe that, when you work hard, you should keep more of your pay, but those opposite are not happy. They wanted to maintain the Scott Morrison tax cuts, which only gave the big increase to the big end of town, to politicians and high-income earners. We are about supporting aspirational voters, aspirational families who are trying to get ahead. That is who we are prepared to deliver our tax cuts to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's turn to another issue. It amazes me why those on that side want to play politics with religion and religious discrimination. Why can't they come to the table and ensure that we have legislation that is going to be bipartisan? Why do they always have to try and take political mileage out of something that is so fundamentally important to Australians? No Australian should be discriminated against because of their faith or their religious beliefs. Here on this side, as a Christian, I feel very comfortable in the Labor Party because we are about ensuring that there's no discrimination in this country, whether it is on the basis of your colour, your nationality, your religious beliefs, your sexuality, your disability or, very importantly, your age. That is what we believe in. We are always happy to work with the opposition, but, when it suits them, they are very quick to get into bed with the Greens and take political mileage out of something that is fundamental to our community. It's a disgrace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  It is a bloodbath out there. Australians are doing it tough under the Albanese government. Labour productivity is down 7.5 per cent over the last 18 months. Real disposable income has fallen by 7.5 per cent. Personal income taxes are up by 23 per cent, much higher than before the election. And labour income from self-employment has fallen by eight per cent. Why is that? It's because the Albanese Labor government have lost control of the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have let immigration run too high, at over 500,000 people a year, and they have allowed interest rates to rocket upwards, causing building contractors to go broke. Not only have we got increasing demand for housing but we also have decreasing supply, so the gap between those people who can actually find a house and those people who can get into one is increasing all the time. That is a direct result of a reckless policy. I don't recall Australians ever being told at the last election that we were going to suddenly double—actually triple—immigration, from pre-election levels of around 280,000 to around 550,000. That is totally reckless, and we're yet to hear the Albanese Labor government explain the reason for this. Why are they allowing this to happen? We are seeing tent cities rise up everywhere, even in my home town of Brisbane in parks. You cannot walk across a park or see a park now without a tent being pitched there. Just across from my electoral office is a park. We've got tents there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, of course, the other big contribution to the cost of living is the enormous increase in energy prices as a result of the Albanese government's reckless rush into renewable energy. The way they're doing this is by heavily subsidising what is effectively unaffordable. So not only have we got increased energy prices; we have got wasted taxpayers' funds in these subsidies trying to prop up something that without subsidies wouldn't work. Just yesterday, I know that the energy minister, Chris Bowen, was skiting about how they'd spent $5 billion on batteries that will provide backup storage for just one million houses. How on earth is spending $5 billion to provide a couple of hours of storage for one million houses considered cheap, reliable and effective? It's not. The Albanese government is out of control, and they need to get their act together.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Senator Wong, the Prime Minister and his government are meeting the requirements of the code of conduct for ministers and upholding the principles of Australian democracy. However, we know that's simply not true. This is especially the case with the nature-positive plan. They're hiding it. They're keeping it secret. Stakeholders have been invited to see some parts of the plan, but the restrictions on these people are extraordinary and anything but democratic, transparent or accountable. Before they're allowed to even enter the room, they must sign a large confidentiality agreement with heavy penalties which stops them from discussing the plan's contents or even going into the room in the first place. Stakeholders are told that they can't take photographs of the draft legislation and can't take any part of it with them. They're allowed a limited time to take a few handwritten notes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor rushes legislation through, not even giving senators remotely enough time to look at bills, consult stakeholders and constituents or develop a response or amendments. Labor was the only party which voted against my inquiry into the carbon capture trial threatening the Great Artesian Basin. Senator Wong couldn't even answer my questions today about whether the Prime Minister is really standing by the code of conduct for ministers that he personally signed. We're watching the slow death of Australian democracy. It began many years ago. It accelerated with the suppression of freedom and dissent by Labor and Liberal governments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The digital ID bill and this so-called nature-positive plan will only further the decline. I'm warning the Australian people to keep your eye on this nature-positive plan, because it's going to have a real impact on our environment, the farmers and everything and how we do business in this country. I'm telling the Australian people: wake up, Australia. Our democracy is being taken from us a piece at a time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This afternoon's question time showed that there is much more to be done to hold PwC to account. I asked the minister about the actions the government is taking and whether it will ban PwC from all commercial interactions and whether she agreed that the paid partnership structure has failed and needs an overhaul, and we're really still awaiting meaningful answers to these questions. There's so much that needs to be done. Australians must have and are looking for meaningful change, given the events they have watched unfold over the last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 12-month inquiry into consulting services that I initiated has exposed serious weaknesses in the governance, leadership and culture of PwC Australia and also raises serious questions about the opaque nature and structure of a large international partnership like PwC. The recent revelations about the secretive network rules used by PwC International to control PwC Australia raise serious questions. Who's in charge? What powers are exercised and by whom? How often have they been used and when? What can the Australian government and the Australian people do about it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The secret legal agreement that we now have knowledge of gives five partners sweeping powers. They are faceless International figures. They can impose their own chosen leader—and they did. This is a firm that not so long ago received millions of dollars in government contracts. Unbeknownst to us, at any time over the 20-odd years of their existence, they could have had International partners and parents swoop in and use the legal guardian card to block decisions. We know the faceless PwC International figures unilaterally replaced CEO Kristin Stubbins with their man from Global, Kevin Burrowes. We know that PwC International is currently imposing supervised remediation—to use their term—to take control of PwC Australia, whom they have defined as a defaulting firm in the wake of the tax leak scam laws. PwC International is running the show. However, they refused to hand over the Linklaters report that spells out who did what in the International sphere as the PwC scandal and misuse of confidential information unfolded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than a year has passed since I referred this matter to our committee, and PwC have still not provided a full and frank account of who did what in Australia or internationally. Getting accurate evidence from them has been like pulling teeth; it has been so reluctantly surrendered. PwC International's unwillingness to cooperate with the committee inquiries underway through this Senate speaks volumes about their attitude to the Australian people, to our parliament and to this Senate. They are making a mockery of the inquiry process working to uncover behaviour that all of us would agree is reprehensible and to ensure integrity in large consulting partnerships operating in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The egregious events in PwC took eight years to surface. They came within a whisker of being buried and failing to come to the attention of the Australian parliament and people. Such a cover-up would have been a national disaster. It is critical than organisations like PwC and our public institutions and departments do not slow investigations or prevent the timely and fulsome release of evidence relevant to proper regulation, transparency and integrity in public governance. The value obtained for billions of dollars of public spending, the quality of financial services and their regulation, along with the wellbeing of thousands of Australian employees, rests on better governance, leadership and regulation in large consulting firms as well as a strong and effective regulatory response in public institutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government truly wants to rebuild people's faith in the system, we need to hold PwC Australia and International to account. We need to lower the cap on the number of partners in these very large accounting firms. You cannot effectively run a partnership with a thousand partners. We need a vigorous and robust public sector with integrity and transparency, and we need good governance in the consulting industry. We need strong and effective regulatory structures that are free from capture by the big firms and by vested interests and organisations that do their jobs with vigour and independence. The response to the PwC tax leak scandal is a true test of this government's integrity and commitment to good policy, not just good politics.</span>

Obviously she has a long history in this area. The reality is that Senator Davey's requests have been so broad that, for the officials in our federal agencies and departments, they initially turned up as many as one million documents in scope. As previously explained to the Senate, the estimated time for a single person to review documents for just one of Senator Davey's requests would be about 8½ years. For the three we are discussing today, there are more than 500 pages of material. I note that, in response to one of Senator Davey's previous requests, we provided 170 pages of documents. I can assure Senator Davey that Minister Plibersek has sought to respond in as timely a manner as possible and can confirm that documents relating to orders for the production of documents Nos 455 and 457 have been provided for tabling today. Documents relating to order No. 456 will be tabled in due course.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to Senator Davey, to Senator Fawcett, as a senior senator, and to Senator Duniam, as a frontbencher, in a former party of government, that I would hope that there would be some responsibility taken in the scope of documents sought. That was a discussion that was regularly had when I was Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—to recognise that a scope of documents that extends too widely is often unnecessary. We are keen and willing to provide transparency, but the senator will know there are limits to public resources. It would be useful if senior frontbenchers, as part of a former party of government, could be aware of this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank and appreciate Senator Wong for attending and giving that explanation. However, it is not satisfactory. One of the most obvious changes since the Albanese government came to power 18 months ago is how far we have come from having an open, transparent and accountable government. We have seen it in the way this government has gone about ignoring OPDs, not just from me but from others in the chamber. The amount of times that we have senators rise to complain about the failure to comply with an order for the production of documents is numerous. We have seen it in the way this government has gone about ignoring those on the front line, whether it be irrigation communities, pharmacists, Western Australian farmers in the banning of live exports or motor dealers in their rushed and hurried and now backflipped fuel efficiency standards. We see the absolute contempt this government has for this chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look no further than the minister for water, whose refusal to engage with farming organisations and their communities in the Murray-Darling Basin is highlighted by her Twitter feed, which shows she has only been in the basin a handful of times. Although, to the credit of the minister for the environment, who is in charge of recycling, she is very adept at recycling photos on that Twitter feed! She keeps replaying: 'Look at me. I flew over the basin. Here's me poignantly looking out the window of my aircraft.' She's recycled that a few times. The lack of time she has actually spent on the ground has well and truly been noted. The minister for water's lack of interest in engaging with basin communities is now being mimicked by her own department, who should hang their heads in shame. To claim a webinar and a web survey is extensive consultation is an absolute slap in the face for communities, who, while being full of consultation fatigue, will not walk away from the table when it comes to their livelihoods and their wellbeing. I guess the department thinks that its current propaganda campaign of lies that is currently playing on television—</span>

                    </a>  Sorry, I withdraw. Their current campaign of television advertisements is tantamount to a public education campaign that couldn't be further from the truth.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To put in context the volume of water that the government is planning to buy back: it is more than all the water left for irrigation in South Australia, Sunraysia and the Victorian GMID combined. If the water were to be bought out of these regions, their economies would be wiped out and Australians would be faced with massive increases in the cost of food. That is why I am so interested and that is why we have asked for these documents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The failure of the minister to release any information on how the government's water policies and legislation will impact these communities and how they came to some of the figures or to provide any information about the cost of the government's policy is deplorable. The Senate inquiry into the water amendment bill was a farce, with the department tasked with implementing the bill refusing to say which communities will be at the forefront of providing the 450 gigalitres of additional water, what the environmental purposes of that water will be, how much recovering that water will cost and what the impact will be on taxpayers and communities into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hope that the government has actually done the work to have that information, but we don't know. This is not the first rodeo when it comes for the Minister for the Environment and Water ignoring the wishes of the Senate. The failure to comply with the Senate order to produce these documents is just a repeat of past efforts. Last year we had the absurd situation where the government deliberately and repeatedly withheld documents from the Senate, through Senate resolutions 318 and 319. Then the government couldn't even get their story straight as to why they couldn't comply. At first they said it was because there were over 1.8 million documents. That was then revised, and it was claimed there were only 850,000 documents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It begs the question as to why the 459 staff at the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the staff in the department have been so busy producing what could be about 1.5 documents per hour per staff member on this topic alone since the Albanese government came to power. I mean, really, I wish! That would be very efficient if that was how much they were producing—or you could say inefficient, because what else are they doing? They're meant to be modelling, conducting reviews and providing fair and frank advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final insult was that, of the 1.8 million claimed documents, they only produced 37. That is why we had the follow-up OPDs—Nos 455, 456 and 457. I acknowledge that 455 and 456 have only been tabled today. They were due yesterday, and I'm now told they have been tabled today. There has not been enough time for me to go through them. We are still waiting on 457 as a result of the minister's failure again to comply with Senate orders. We are again seeing the complete incompetence of this government and the complete disregard of this government towards this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want to see any senior bureaucrats bullied or reduced to tears, but I would respectfully ask that the water bureaucrats improve their productivity and not take over two months to pull together a handful of emails and documents. And if it's more than a handful then you have to ask why. That is why, on our side, we look at efficiency dividends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the minister, her desire for secrecy and her lack of transparency are now commonplace among this government. We know this is the government of non-disclosure agreements. They like to do consultations behind closed doors, with the heavy-handedness of people who breach the confidence, which is not the open and transparent government that we were promised prior to the election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time the Minister for the Environment and Water directed her department to step away from the keyboard, release the information the Senate had requested and get out into the communities to do proper consultation on the implementation of the remainder of the Basin Plan, which is what communities are crying out for. We cannot allow this government to continue to ignore the wishes of communities or the wishes of the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't take up too much time because I know we've got a lot of things to deal with this afternoon, but I do want to explain why it is that the Greens believe that a select committee—the Select Committee on Supermarket Prices, in this case—is the appropriate vehicle to conduct an inquiry. That committee has heard already in its existence multiple witnesses and has received multiple submissions calling for the introduction of divestiture powers into Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a matter for the government that it has already ruled out the introduction of divestiture powers into Australia. Of course, by ruling out support for introducing divestiture powers, the Labor Party—once the party of the worker—has exposed itself as the party of capital. That's because, in opposing divestiture powers which would enable much-needed competition to be brought into the supermarket sector, the Labor Party is taking the side of the big supermarket corporations, Coles and Woolworths, who are each booking billion-dollar profits every year whilst using their market dominance to do over farmers, workers and customers. Labor is backing them in over the millions of Australians who are struggling to make ends meet and who are being price-gouged at the supermarket checkout.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia needs divestiture laws because right across our economy there is too much concentration of market power. Monopolies, duopolies and oligopolies, which we have repeated examples of in this country, never give good outcomes to consumers and they never deliver good outcomes for suppliers. That's the case in the supermarket sector, in the bank sector, in the airline sector and in multiple other sectors in the Australian economy. Labor should support divestiture laws. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason this inquiry is the appropriate vehicle is that there are people sitting on this committee who've heard repeated evidence about the need for divestiture laws in this country. We will be hearing evidence from a range of experts in this area and it is appropriate that the Select Committee on Supermarket Prices be the vehicle for an inquiry into this report. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As Chair of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, I rise to speak to the tabling of the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny Digest 5 of 2024</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The digest opens by acknowledging the recent passing of Emeritus Professor Jim Davis. The committee does so to pay tribute to the outstanding contribution of Professor Davis as the committee's longest serving legal adviser, having supported the committee for 25 years, from 1983 to 2008. In this time, Professor Davis also served as legal adviser to the Standing Committee for Regulations and Ordinances from 1997 to 2000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On his retirement as legal adviser, the committee hosted a dinner, with speeches made by former Senators Helen Coonan, Barney Cooney and Andrew Murray. This demonstrates the high regard with which he was held across all corners of the Parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The speeches were consistent in their high regard for Professor Davis's wisdom, humour and strength of character. Andrew Murray remarked that Jim had an academic's depth; a practitioner's experience; a teacher's patience; a lawyer's precision; a necessary tolerance; a comic's wit; a libertarians' attitudes; and, crucially, a healthily larrikin-like suspicion of the Executive and its handmaiden, the bureaucracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On behalf of the committee, I extend condolences to Professor Davis's family and friends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The digest also reports on the committee's consideration of 6 bills which were introduced into the Parliament during recent sitting weeks, as well as amendments made to 4 bills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the Digest, the committee has identified potential scrutiny concerns in relation to 2 newly introduced bills. The Digest also contains the committee's comments on recent ministerial responses in relation to 4 bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to draw the Senate's attention in particular to the committee's comments on the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023 and an associated bill</span>. The committee thanks the Attorney-General for his constructive response to the committee's comments concerning the bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee previously raised concerns with the public interest certificate regime in the main bill. These provisions empower Commonwealth, state and territory Attorneys-General to issue certificates, which prevent the Tribunal from disclosing specified information or documents to applicants before making a decision. This potentially impacts the procedural fairness rights of individuals appearing before the Tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Procedural fairness is a fundamental common law right that ensures fair decision-making. Amongst other matters, it includes requiring that people who are adversely affected by a decision are given an adequate opportunity to put their case before a decision is made—known as the 'fair hearing rule'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In Scrutiny Digest 2 of 2024, the committee requested advice from the Attorney-General on this matter. The Attorney-General has explained that the framework balances fair hearing rights with the need to protect sensitive information. Further, it would not be appropriate for the Tribunal to have discretion to disclose information under certificate as such responsibility is rightly vested in the responsible minister or Director-General of Security. These officers are uniquely placed to understand the sensitivity of the material and consequences of its disclosure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee remains concerned that the public interest certificate and intervention provisions will have a significant impact on an applicant's procedural fairness rights. The committee acknowledges the importance of the policy justification of protecting sensitive information from disclosure but maintains that fairness may be legitimately adjusted whilst adopting a more flexible approach. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the committee sought the Attorney-General's advice on the rigid approach adopted in the bill for particular requirements for proceedings that take place in the intelligence and security jurisdictional area of the Tribunal. The bill provides that applicants cannot be provided reasons for intelligence and security decisions and the Director-General of Security can issue sensitive information certificates and public interest certificates to prevent the disclosure of evidence or documents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee is of the view that there is room to recalibrate the balance of the risk of disclosure against the applicant's right to a fair hearing in a manner which better recognises the fundamental nature of that right and also in treating individuals with respect and dignity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee considers that the decision not to consider additional mechanisms for the protection of a fair hearing in the Intelligence and Security jurisdictional area is unfortunate and a lost opportunity.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee also takes this opportunity to draw to the attention of the Senate a provision in the Consequential Amendments Bill that encroaches on the powers of the Parliament. If enacted, it would restrict the power of the Parliament or its committees to receive information or documents relating to protection visa decisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the committee acknowledges that the intention of the provision is to provide protection to the privacy and safety of persons involved in such decisions, the committee notes that the provision asks the Parliament to agree to an encroachment of its own powers. The power to seek information and documents is a fundamental power of a parliamentary chamber, necessary to support its ability to inquire into matters of interest. This in turn supports its ability to conduct fully informed debate on matters of public importance, and undertake its legislative function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee will closely scrutinise any legislative provision that represents an intrusion on the powers, privileges and immunities of the Parliament and is of the view that only in the rarest and most extraordinary of cases will such a provision be considered to be appropriate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny Digest 2 of 2024 </span>the committee sought advice from the Attorney-General on this matter. Again, the committee thanks the Attorney-General for his response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However the response in this area did not fully engage with the substance of the committee's scrutiny concerns. In particular, the response did not consider whether existing mechanisms within parliaments that protect from disclosure information if there is a genuine public interest reason for it not to be disclosed. These mechanisms include the ability of officers to raise public interest immunity claims and the ability of committees to receive evidence on an in-camera basis, if making the information public is not in the public interest or necessary for the committee to perform its functions. The committee is of the view that such mechanisms would adequately protect from public release information relating to reviewable protection decisions where disclosure is not in the public interest. The committee has therefore recommended that the bill be amended to remove the provision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I encourage all parliamentarians to carefully consider the committee's analysis on this and other matters contained in the Digest. With these comments, I commend the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny Digest 5 of 2024</span> to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A strong and sustainably funded biosecurity system is essential to protect Australia from devastating and costly pest and disease outbreaks, and to safeguard our $99.9 billion agricultural, fisheries and forestry industries into the future. All Australians benefit from a strong biosecurity system. It protects our unique environment, economy, and way of life from a myriad of increasing and complex biosecurity threats. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A robust biosecurity system is fundamental to protecting our international trade and enables our regional and remote communities to prosper, providing security for 1.6 million jobs across our agricultural supply chain. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But a world-class biosecurity system does not just naturally occur. It needs to be sustained and supported by predictable, long-term funding that is equitable, transparent and secure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has done just that. We have delivered on our election commitment of sustainable funding for Australia's biosecurity system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The May Budget last year included new and permanent funding of more than $1 billion over 4 years, and $267 million per year ongoing from 2027-28. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a first for Australia. We have never had sustainable, predictable and permanent biosecurity funding. This is despite it being recommended in numerous reviews and reports, and continually highlighted as a priority for industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without this new package, funding for the Commonwealth biosecurity system would have declined over the forward estimates by 15.9 per cent, almost $100 million per year, to less than $500 million in 2026-27.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The previous government's biosecurity funding legacy was to lock-in funding cuts of almost $100 million per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Not only has this Government delivered greatly increased and permanent funding for the Commonwealth biosecurity system, we have made changes to the way biosecurity is funded to ensure it is more sustainable and more equitable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">More taxpayer funding than ever before is being committed to biosecurity. Additionally, risk creators and those who benefit from strong biosecurity protection are also making additional contributions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Primary producers, whether growing for the domestic market or exporting into premium overseas markets—benefit considerably from our favourable biosecurity status.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is reflected in the returns being secured from our export markets and the costs of recovering markets where outbreaks occur. In 2022-23, ABARES forecast agricultural, fisheries and forestry exports to be valued at $82.7 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This package of three Bills will introduce a new legislative framework to provide for the imposition, collection and administration of the new Biosecurity Protection Levy. The package includes two imposition Bills and one collection Bill. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Agriculture (Biosecurity Protection) Levies Bill 2024 provides for the imposition of biosecurity protection levies that are duties of excise in relation to agriculture, fisheries and forestry products and goods produced in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Agriculture (Biosecurity Protection) Charges Bill 2024 provides for the imposition of biosecurity protection charges that are duties of customs in relation to agriculture, fisheries and forestry products that are exported from Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Agriculture (Biosecurity Protection) Levies and Charges Collection Bill 2024 provides for the collection and administration of levies and charges imposed by the Levies Bill and Charges Bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The two imposition Bills provide for the making of regulations that would prescribe the rate of biosecurity protection levies and charges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The legislation will provide for the imposition of biosecurity protection levy and charge separately to the Primary Industries levies and charges framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know that many producers already invest in biosecurity preparedness and response capabilities, be it on-farm as well as through research and development, membership fees for Animal Health Australia and Plant Health Australia or industry groups. These investments are critical to biosecurity. But they do not fund our biosecurity efforts at the border, at airports, seaports and mail centres, and nor do they fund the technical, scientific and surveillance work that is funded through the Australian Government biosecurity budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This means that funding from the Biosecurity Protection Levy will not replace or duplicate the efforts of producers, rather, it supports important Commonwealth biosecurity activity to manage the risk of pests and diseases entering Australia in the first place. Currently producers, whilst a significant beneficiary, do not contribute directly to Commonwealth biosecurity efforts to manage the risk of pests and diseases entering Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, it is not just down to producers to contribute more. Under the changes we have introduced, risk creators like importers and travellers, are also contributing more to Commonwealth biosecurity funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 July 2024, a new cost recovery charge on low value goods imported into Australia by air or sea will be introduced and is expected to recover around $27 million annually. Up to now, taxpayers have been paying this cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is in addition to an increase in fees and charges for importers that was implemented from 1 July last year. These increases were as a result of the first comprehensive review of biosecurity fees and charges since 2015 and are expected to add around $36 million to the biosecurity bottom line. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As these and other changes to cost recovery roll out, we expect to raise around an extra $100 million per year from importers from 2024-25.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Not only are importers paying more, but from 1 July this year, international travellers will also be contributing more to Government funding to support biosecurity costs associated with international travellers. The passenger movement charge will increase from $60 to $70 per international traveller. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Biosecurity threats are increasing due to a rise in the volume and complexity of trade, the effects of climate change and the ever-increasing worldwide spread of pests and diseases. Our biosecurity system needs to keep up with these changes and we need to be able to plan for the future.</span>
