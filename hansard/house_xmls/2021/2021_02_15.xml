It probably doesn't require, now that it's become more commonplace, a great deal of explanation, but this document and its terms are in very similar form to the previous iteration of it. I think on this occasion the substantial difference is that we can have remoting into the Federation Chamber. Obviously, the reason that this has become necessary is the unfortunate situation that has arisen in Victoria.</span>

This is the first report of the Petitions Committee for what I hope will be a prosperous and happy year for all. Since my last presentation, in December, the committee has continued to receive and consider new petitions on a range of diverse topics. Many have concerned the challenges that we face with the COVID-19 virus—in fact 19 petitions and 26 ministerial responses included in this presentation are concerning matters relating to the virus—but petitioners also continue to be concerned with a range of other longstanding and important issues such as taxes, the environment, education and politics, which are also included in this report. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On another note, the committee has recently launched an inquiry into aspects of the House petitioning system relating to security and accessibility. Through this inquiry, the committee will investigate how best to maintain the important responsibility we have in ensuring a petitioning system that is accessible and easy to use but also provides acceptable levels of security to reduce instances of fraudulent activity and to maintain the integrity of the petitioning process. This is an important balance that the committee has taken seriously, and we look forward to considering where improvements can be made. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's share of global CO2 emissions from domestic use of fossil fuels is about 1.4% of global fossil fuel and if you add on the domestic use of our exports then it is raised by 5%. Fossil fuels are one of the dominant causes of climate change and contribute to 89% of global Co2 emissions. If Australia cuts its use of fossil fuel emissions by 50% by the year 2030 and lower it to zero by 2050 then we can still prevent ourselves from contributing to setting off an irreversible chain of human caused events related to climate change. Australia is in a very bad position related to climate change with the flooding, fires and cyclones being multiplied across the country, but we can still save ourselves from a world of pain if we meet these targets.</span>

The situation Australia finds itself in now was unpredictable. We are not asking to come back and return to normal. We are asking to return to our home and families and agree with the quarantine, however we are asking to not be forced into a hotel alone for 2 weeks isolation and then be given the bill for which most of us are unemployed and cannot pay.  We are being treated like criminals for wanting to return home, when not done anything wrong. We feel abandoned by our countries and are left worrying about our futures.</span>

If we are going to be forced into the situation, we ask thee house to reconsider the cost, as most are unable to pay for the bill after losing our jobs overseas having to pay for a Business Class ticket to just come home. Furthermore we ask for compassion in this situation, as most people are struggling financially due to losing their jobs as well as mentally from already being isolated in a foreign country and being separated from their families.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Since federation, Australia has been at the whims of the United Kingdom, our head of state being a monarch appointed Governor General. For obvious reasons, this is not something the average Australian is okay with in 2020. Twenty-one years has passed since the original referendum regarding this issue occurred, where Australia returned a verdict of No. But twenty-one years on, there are entirely new generations with differing world views than those common a mere two decades ago, and I believe it is for this reason that a referendum on Australia becoming a republic is necessary.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The administrative cost of welfare within Australia is rocketing upwards year after year while the funds received by the people the system is intended to help has not increased substantially in real terms since 1994. When factoring in cost of living increases such as rent, childcare and utilities governmental income supplement are actually becoming less and less over time, despite living in the land of the "Fair Go". As a result Australia is suffering a widening income inequality between the richest and the poorest that must be addressed. With the numerous recent scandals suffered by Centrelink such as the robo-debt scandal and the increased fracturing of services into numerous different categories, we need an overhaul of the welfare system in order to address the changing needs of Australia. We need to examine if programs such as the Universal Basic Income which has resulted in such success in countries such as Canada, Finland and the Netherlands. We also need to compare if the costs of such a program would be offset by the simplification of Government programs such as Newstart, JobSeeker and the disability pension.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I petition the House to repeal their idea of a gas plant and terminus in Kurri Kurri on the old Kurri Kurri Aluminium Smelter site. Kurri Kurri is a small town of 6044 at the last census of 2016, it is one of the last bastions that has a small-town feel in the Hunter Valley. But, due to development and expansion of housing which cannot be sustainable because of the lack of infrastructure (roads, hospital closures etc) the area and surrounds have seen a degradation of community and social connectedness. The government may see this gas an employment opportunity for the area however, this kind of energy has detrimental effects on the community at health and societal levels as has been witnessed in Queensland. There has been no community consultation, but the local council had it on their last agenda. We must not let Australia's small towns become fodder for what a politician would not have in their own backyard. These gas lines are notorious for infiltrating our waterways, water that lights up (as seen on 4 Corners) and devastating chronic and incurable diseases.  We can not allow this kind of roughshod approach with no evidence-based scientific proof that no harm will be done. Save our small country towns. Kurri Kurri - Aboriginal for the Very First. Saver it!</span>

This is causing considerable problems working from home, home work for students etc. There is reluctance to recable because of the cost that it would incur to the NBN , due to the trees, and the possible impact recabling could have on the trees themselves.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Low income employees of public hospitals and registered charities are particularly effected by this rule.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian citizens overseas feel defeated and are being ignored by every avenue. We are being treated inhumanely and forgotten by our own Government. COVID has obviously turned the world upside down, but during this pandemic, no other country has abandoned its citizens like this. We don't want special treatment, grants, money. We just want to return to our home country. To be with our families, and get through this pandemic together. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Further to this, the media is portraying us to be the bad people as we should have come home sooner. A lot of us couldn't at that time, and still can't today. We have been trying for months. We are unable to secure flights. We have already been subjected to harsh lockdowns overseas, we've lost our jobs and a place to call home. Hundreds should be enough for the Government to take action, but you have thousands pleading with you.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to lift the cap on returning citizens or work with the airlines to secure our flights. Also to consider alternative options to forced hotel quarantine for returned travelers, such as home quarantine, the implementation of Global Positioning System trackers, or allowing return travelers to choose a hotel within their budgets.</span>

Quarantine is an emergency power pursuant to s 477 of the act (and s 97).

              <span class="HPS-Small">A lot of things are currently playing out in the US regarding their presidential election. However, little can be read from Australian main stream media about the Trump Campaign stories (eg, the observation made by Federal Election Commission Chairman Trey Trainor that voter fraud is taking place; court proceedings currently underway in various US states for vote recount; Lucian Lincoln Wood joining the Trump Campaign team in support of court proceedings on vote recount, etc), except the negative portrayal of President Donald Trump's refusion to concede an election defeat. Considering the powerful influence the media may have on public opinions and, potentially, on government policy-making or even election outcomes, this single-sided leaning of the main stream media in Australia sets an alarm that the democratic system of our nation has been dangerously eroded or compromised and there could be unthinkable consequences continuing this path unchecked. Australians do not want to see our media system operates the same way as a propaganda machine of a totalitarian regime.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The main reason is the rapidly declining student visa applications caused by tightening pathways to permanent residency, stringent work limitations on students, and the outbreak of COVID-19. Universities have estimated a drop in $3-4.6 billion in the education sector and $19 billion over the next three years. A loss of 38,400 Australian jobs to follow. International students are vital to our country's aging rate, and the opportunity to work and settle in our country should be thoroughly considered. Removing work limits will encourage students abroad to emigrate; and those who currently reside in Australia to stay and contribute to our economy; and our society. This is very relevant to the state of Victoria as small and large businesses look to kickstart their production for the busiest time of the year allowing student workers to become a part of the rebuilding process.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian Consumer Law is for the protection of consumers and provides guarantees when they engage the services of professionals. S60 has a guarantee that services will be provided with due care and skill. S61(1) guarantees that where a consumer expressly or by implication makes known to the provider any particular purpose for which the services are being acquired that any product resulting from the service will be reasonably fit for that purpose. S60(2) includes where prior negotiations or arrangements in relation to acquiring the services conducted or made that the services and any product resulting from the service will be of such a nature, quality, state, condition that they might reasonably be expected to achieve that result. Engineers and architects are an integral part of construction building and many other industries ensuring building/product design standards, safety standards, suitability and durability of materials/products to be used for a particular purpose will meet Statutory requirements therefore they should be required to provide a product fit for purpose.</span>

No other business, trade or profession, who is required under ACL S60 to provide a service with due care and skill, is exempt from providing a service with a guarantee as to the fitness for a particular purpose.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Epilepsy is a neurological disorder affecting the brain. It affects adults, children more than half have a secondary illness or disability. Most adults can't drive, work or even function and need multiple medications, therapy and neurological appointment. This is the same for children. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, epilepsy is not classed as a disability. The government needs to change this as many need more assistance and more education.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">NDIS covers only the tools for epilepsy sufferers. For example cameras to watch the person in a room and watches. Nothing else is covered under NDIS as it is not classed as a disability, it's only classed as a neurological disorder. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Epilepsy should be classed as a disability when it affects the brain mentally, physically and emotionally. Seizures due to epilepsy can lead to death, including children and includes sleep seizures. Adults can lose their jobs and are unable to work. Epilepsy sufferers who have a secondary disability are covered for the second disability but not epilepsy on its own. This has significant cost implications due to the significant fees associated with medications, neurologist appointments, therapists and operations. These factors are not covered. Many people and children lose their lives because they cannot afford the support needed to help them with epilepsy.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Many Australians have been stranded overseas for months directly due to the caps applied by the Australian Government. Australians have already paid thousands of dollars to secure flights, which haven't taken off. Many Australians who ended up stuck overseas have already lost their jobs, and are either paying for accommodation out of savings, borrowing money from friends, or the one-off Government loan. Whilst returning Australians agree quarantining on arrival is the first line of defense and helps in keeping Australia safe, Australians stuck abroad are asking for a review into the fees.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to consider alternatives payments or options for quarantine, such as allowing us to find our own hotels in our budgets or allowing us to pay back the fee through community services. We also ask that the amount of time we have been trying to get home is taken into consideration. Further to this, we again ask for compassion in this already difficult time.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian government has committed more than $3.3 billion to access COVID-19 vaccines, through 5 agreements. Only $200 million of that funding (6%) is invested in COVAX, an initiative led by WHO, GAVI and CEPI to ensure a fair and equitable access of COVID-19 vaccines to every country in the world.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's contribution to COVAX represents only 2.6% of global donor contributions, lagging significantly behind countries with comparable GDPs, who have been more severely affected by COVID-19, including UK (23% of total donor contributions), Norway (11%), Italy (5.5%), France (5.5%) amongst others.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's COVID-19 situation is amongst the most privileged worldwide, and as such we are in a position to be global leaders in helping fight this disease for the entire world, not just for us.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Given current situation, Australia is not in urgent need of early access to vaccines, and helping ensure that vaccines get distributed fairly around the world is not only a necessary act of kindness to less privileged countries, but will also help speed up the reactivation of international business and travel for Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to redistribute the $3.3 billion currently aimed mostly at ensuring early access to vaccines only for Australians, to increase our donation and participation in COVAX. In the case where vaccine supply agreements with companies and institutions cannot be modified, we ask the House to pledge to donate the bulk of our early supply of vaccines to COVAX.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">A report released by the Grattan Institute on the 20th October 2020 has revealed that the Federal Government over the period of the last 10 years has reduced funding to five seperate Government accountability agencies: the Australian National Audit Office, the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority, the information commissioner (who handles all FOIA requests), the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the Commonwealth ombudsman.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the bodies charged with Government oversight and investigation should be protected from the very Government they oversee. Although the members of Government are our representatives, we rarely see them representing the issues of the Australian people.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For thousands of Australians living in France, this means there is no avenue to claim an Australian pension if they would otherwise be eligible. Those who wish to apply for a pension - many of whom have lived in France for a long time - must uproot their lives and return to Australia or move to a country with which Australia does have an agreement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Social Security Act 1991 makes residency a fundamental requirement to claiming a pension. Under s 7(3), several factors must be taken into consideration in determining a person's residency, including frequency and duration of the person's travel outside Australia. The Department of Social Services advises that if a person regularly spends more than six months a year outside Australia, their residence in Australia is deemed questionable. Further, taken in isolation, a three-year continuous absence would be regarded as an upper limit to being considered residing in Australia, unless there are special circumstances.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to urge the Federal Government to re-commence negotiations with the Republic of France with a view to concluding a social agreement between the two countries that enables Australians living in France to claim a pension without being required to meet the residency rule under Australia's social security legislation.</span>

The report details 36 instances of serious war crimes allegedly committed by Australian SAS soldiers in Afghanistan. The report is the result of years of independent investigation undertaken by Assistant Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force Paul Brereton and contains strong evidence that these acts were not the result of war conflicts, but instead the result of a culture of brutality within the SAS.</span>

Mr Stokes has a long history of supporting the SAS and is free to use his funds how he sees fit. However, it is not appropriate for the Chairman of the AWM to fund the defence of soldiers accused of heinous war crimes. Mr Stoke's conduct shows blatant disrespect for the innocent civilians and their families allegedly killed by SAS soldiers in Afghanistan. Mr Stoke's actions do not align with values the Australian public expect of the Australian War Memorial.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As of 30 June 2014, the Australian Government via the Commonwealth Ombudsman maintains that people could have confidence in the advances being made by Defence in reforming its culture and in Defence's ability to appropriately address complaints of abuse where it occurred. Despite an adoption of programs for specialised training on the matter of misconduct in the workplace, instances of serious abuse are still occuring and a culture of sexism, sexual misconduct, bullying and impunity are still prevalent in the Australian Defence Force. Claiming that Defence culture has reformed to an appropriate standard since the introductions of such programs and enforcing the "cut-off" date for Reparation Payments, infers that either 1) serious abuse no longer occurs within the Defence Force and/or 2) that people who experience 'serious abuse' after 30 June 2014 are not deserving of reparation or acknowledgment. Both of which are unacceptable and antithetical to Defence values of Professionalism, Loyalty, Integrity, Courage, Innovation and Teamwork.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 27th September 2020, Azerbaijan's dictator Ilham Aliyev broke ceasefire obligations to attack the indigenous Armenians of Artsakh, using missiles, tanks, drones and other artillery. They illegally dropped cluster bombs in civilian areas, white phosphorus munitions on forests, beheaded POWs, bombed churches, schools, hospitals and civilian homes.</span>

The scheme is incapable of delivering and does not represent Australian democratic values.  It continues to alienate fathers from their children.

For fully self funded Type 1 diabetics CGM costs are prohibitively high, currently up to $8000 per year and starting at $4000. CGM is already fully subsidised for under 21 year olds and for those over 21 with valid concessional status. By providing fully subsidised CGM to all Type 1 Diabetics, hospital and medical costs through diabetes associated complications and emergency admissions will be greatly reduced. As a Type 1 diabetic, or relative/friend/carer of a Type 1 diabetic, using CGM is the single most effective tool I have used/seen for a Type 1 diabetic to achieve significantly greater blood glucose management and overall quality of life. It is therefore imperative that the House extend fully subsidised Constant Glucose Monitoring devices (CGM) to all Australian Type 1 diabetics.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the current legislation, businesses are being dis/advantaged in access to the government's Cash Flow Boost stimulus response to COVID-19 based on the way in which they lodge their Business Activity Statements with The ATO. The legislation requires a business must have made a lodgement showing 'taxable supply' prior to March 12th in order to access the Cash Flow Boost. This means a business created on or after Jan 1st 2020 which files their BAS quarterly is automatically deemed ineligible. Equally, a business formed on or after 1 July 2019 which files their BAS Annually is automatically deemed ineligible. If those same businesses had filed their BAS lodgements on a monthly basis, they would be deemed eligible. Two identical businesses with different BAS lodgement periods receive vastly different outcomes. The red tape of when a business lodges its business activity statement is creating unequal support under the current legislation.</span>

This country takes pride in the strength of its democracy, and to take this recommendation and indeed, the raft of recommendations in this report, would weaken this democracy and move Australia closer to the darkened democracy of the United States.</span>

The ACCC said they have no control over the oil company pricing and that this needs to be addressed by the federal government. Because the ACCC cannot provide consumer protection, it falls into the hands of the government to provide protection the Australian consumer. The price of fuel always increases when holidays are occurring. When Australia needs a hand getting back to normal, the oil companies don't want to assist and only want to make more money. All tenders for government should have a rise and fall term which is associated with the rise and fall of the price of fuel.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The travel ban rules in place for international travel have hugely impacted the mental health state of citizens and residents of Australia whose families reside overseas. We appreciate that the current regulations are to safeguard Australian health system and population, but if it is saving Australians from the virus infection in the one hand, in the other hand it is causing immense mental health deterioration due to the separation of families from loved ones for an extended period of time. As the public health system data can show, not only is the number of mental health issues increasing sharply, but also creating physical health complications, which is increasing the cost of public health in the country. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Numerous immigrants financially support their parents and families overseas, who therefore cannot leave their jobs for 3 months to be allowed to leave Australia in exemption. Moreover, parents are not considered 'immediate family' to be allowed to enter Australia either. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I believe an application for early vaccination for residents who need to travel overseas to receive the deserved love of their families, will ban the need to quarantine and alleviate the state of mental health scenario in the country, as well as give people their basic right to come and go.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to legislate and apply early vaccination program for international travelers under compassionate grounds. Let us allow the residents of Australia to leave and relieve their emotional stress and heal their mental health conditions with the love of family.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's largest economic trading partner is carrying out genocide against Uyghurs and other ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang. Since 2016, millions of Uyghurs have disappeared into the grinding maw of Xinjiang's gulag archipelago in the largest incarceration of a people based on their ethnic or cultural identity since The Holocaust. Whole villages have been emptied out and levelled; ancient mosques, shrines and Uyghur cemeteries bulldozed. Chinese state-sponsored sterilization campaigns and forced abortions lower Uyghur birth rates in a bid to preserve the primacy of Han settlers in the region and big data helps assist Chinese authorities in their detention sweeps. Former detainees tell of extensive political indoctrination and psychological torture. They tell of brutal bashings and beatings for prisoners who refuse to give up Islam or announce their loyalty to the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Australia can no longer be complicit in these historic crimes by continuing to do business with this regime. One day, generations from now, young people will ask: who elevated themselves above the cowards and appeasers to say, 'Not in our name'? We hope and pray they will learn that of all the nations of the world, Australia stood up in the face of this genocide.</span>

God gave us free will therefore we should be able to exercise freedom in everything especially when it comes to voting. Free will is the ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded. Free will is closely linked to the concepts of moral responsibility, praise, guilt, sin, and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.We should not be forced to vote, if we choose not to there should be no penalty enforced.   when you enforce voting people will simply choose to not show up or they just choose a candidate randomly without thinking and it won't count anyway. You are just causing resentment and disbelief in the system.</span>

When you don't force someone to do something they normally choose it in the end anyway becuase it was a decision they made and not something that was imposed on them.  Everyone deserves the freedom of choice!</span>

In 1982 EXXON predicted a 1.5°C rise around 2030.  In 1991 Shell promoted up to a 4°C rise by 2050 stating it was 'change too fast perhaps for life to adapt without severe dislocation'.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Reforms to the Redress of Grievance and Defence inquiry processes are urgently needed. Currently they are seriously flawed, and often result in significant mental trauma and reputational harm to serving ADF members. Defence Inquiries are not bound by rules of evidence or legal technicalities. Witnesses can and do provide false testimony that is then protected by legal privilege. Defence Inquiry officers are not constrained by the fundamental concepts of justice and equality. Most are not legally trained and some have only ever undertaken four days of non-mandatory training in how to conduct an inquiry. These processes are supposed to be timely but most cases drag on for years, prolonging the mental trauma to the ADF member. Their anxiety is compounded by feeling victimised. Those who succeed in arguing their case, find their situation unchanged because too much time has passed and there is no policy for corrective action. ADF members will carry unresolved grievances into life beyond service which will impact the Government's efforts to realistically reduce the number of suicides currently plaguing the ADF veteran community.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to support changes to the Defence (Inquiry) Regulations 2018 so that Defence Inquiries are subject to legal technicalities, rules of evidence, principles of open justice and common law; Defence Inquiry officers undertake legal training; witness testimony taken under oath/affirmation; introduce an appeal process outside the Chain of Command and corrective action policy to ensure procedural fairness, and access to genuine mediation for ADF members to resolve workplace complaints.</span>

The clinic is therefore unable to offer the gap only payment to its patients due to the financial burden the payment delay places on them. Improving the gap payment process for GP clinics will allow the local clinic to provide a more affordable service to the community, which will deliver better health outcomes. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Falun Gong is a peaceful meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance. Millions of Falun Gong practitioners in China have been fired, jailed, tortured or killed by the Chinese Communist regime since July 1999. There have been persistent reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in China, primarily practitioners of Falun Gong. The Independent China Tribunal, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, concluded in its Final Judgement in 2019: "Forced organ harvesting has been committed for year, throughout China on a significant scale and that Falun Gong practitioners have been one - and probably the main - source of organ supply" and that crimes against humanity against Falun Gong have been proved "beyond reasonable doubt". </span>

Pass a motion or make a statement to openly request and immediate end to the 20-year persecution of Falun Gong in China and the immediate release of all Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience; 2. Urge China to immediately end the practice of organ harvesting from all prisoners of conscience and conduct a thorough public education campaign to ensure Australians do not unknowingly participate in forced organ harvesting in China; 3. Deny visas and bar entry to Chinese officials and policemen who are involved in the persecution of Falun Gong.</span>

Currently, JobKeeper payments are due to end on 28 March 2021. However, given the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in NSW and border closures across Australia (and international), the travel and tourism industry continues to be heavily impacted and will continue to suffer the effects of the pandemic at least until the end of 2021. Unlike other industries such as retail, fitness and certain sectors of hospitality which have seen a rebound in business to sustainable and almost normal operations for a number of moths now, travel agencies have not been as fortunate due to sustained domestic and international border restrictions. We have and will continue to experience little to no business or achieve profitability in the foreseeable future. Travel and tourism is a key contributor to the Australian economy. In order to support and preserve this multi-billion-dollar industry, it is crucial that we receive the government's continual support without which thousands of Australian jobs will be lost. </span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Australia Day</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 9 April 2020 to the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, regarding the petition number EN1341. I note the petition calls for the House of Representatives to declare 25 January "First Nations Day" as an annual public holiday, and to provide a seat to an accepted Tribal Elder in every local council with the same privileges as an elected council member. The Prime Minister has asked me to respond on his behalf. I sincerely apologise for the delay in responding to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate the suggestion for one way in which reconciliation with Indigenous Australians could be incorporated into a day of national celebration. It is important that we acknowledge and understand our past as through this we can build a more understanding and cohesive community. However, at this time the Prime Minister does not intend to declare an additional public holiday.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Australia Day Council (NADC) is the coordinating body for Australia Day celebrations across the nation. The NADC is committed to playing a part in the journey of reconciliation by helping all Australians to move forward with a better understanding of our shared past.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Day is a day to reflect, respect and celebrate because we are all part of the story of Australia. It's a day to reflect on the past, present and future - to think about where we have been and where we are going as a nation. It's a day to listen to each other and respect each other's stories and contributions. And it's a day to celebrate our extraordinary nation, its achievements and, most of all, its people and our resilience in the face of adversity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, Australia Day is a day to reflect on the impact of European settlement had on Indigenous Australians and their way of life and respectfully learn about the ongoing history, traditions and cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring Indigenous voices are heard at all levels of government. To do this, we need the buy-in of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to the matters and policies that affect them. There are many views on how to achieve this and it is clear that more work needs to be done on a way forward.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to the Prime Minister's attention. I trust this information will be of assistance in responding to the petitioners.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your email of 24 August 2020 to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Marise Payne, regarding Petition EN1538 asking to place tariffs on all Chinese imports; stop selling China our coal and materials; bring all manufacturing from China; and charge higher import tariffs. As the matter falls within my portfolio responsibility, your letter has been passed to me for reply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's openness to trade is a key driver of our national prosperity, supporting jobs and higher wages. China is an important part of this story. It is the second-largest economy in the world, the biggest goods market in our region, and our two economies have strong mutual complementarities. It will remain our largest two-way trading partner for the foreseeable future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Access to global markets allows our businesses to secure economies of scale that are simply not possible with our relatively small population and domestic market. Trade drives innovation and productivity and allows our businesses to access the inputs they need at the lowest prices, which in turn helps ensure they remain internationally competitive. Australian consumers benefit too through having access to greater choice at lower prices. Without trade, our standard of living would be substantially lower.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) entered into force, Australians have benefitted immensely from the lower prices of imported goods from China. Many Australian companies could not thrive without access to the Chinese market or to the many benefits from good, value for money Chinese manufactures and inputs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to a mutually beneficial relationship with China. It is guided by our national interests. Australia has benefitted from China's economic growth and the corresponding growth in our bilateral trade and investment relationship. And at all times, we will continue to be true to our values and the protection of our own sovereignty.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the pandemic has been tough for many Australian and assure you that getting Australians back into jobs is the priority of the Australian Government. Only where Australians are not able to fill positions can foreign workers take up these roles. Foreign workers have helped to fill persistent labour shortages in rural and regional Australia whilst also contributing to enhanced economic integration and development in our region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I thank the petitioners for sharing their concerns and I assure them we remain committed to building a strong open economy at home, enabling our capacity to protect and pursue our national interests.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is resolutely committed to meeting our obligations under the Paris Agreement and ambitious climate action, including to the goals of the Agreement and to limit global emissions to net zero in the second half of the century.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's Paris target to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030 is a significant contribution to global climate action. Our national target is achievable, balanced and responsible, and is part of coordinated global action to take climate action for future generations while keeping our economy strong.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our climate action agenda is a practical one, driven by technology rather than taxation. On 22 September 2020, the Government released the Roadmap's first annual Low Emissions Technology Statement. The Statement articulates five priority technologies and accompanying stretch goals—ambitious but realistic goals to bring priority low emissions technologies to economic parity with existing mature technologies:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Roadmap, along with other key strategies such as our National Hydrogen Strategy, will reduce our emissions and help provide global partners with clean energy for the transition to low emission economies.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to making clean energy technologies globally scalable, commercial and achievable, including by developing low emissions pathways through global partnerships.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are working to reduce emissions in hard-to-abate sectors through the Leadership Group for Industry Transition, including promoting private sector investment in transitioning carbon-intensive industries such as steel making from fossil fuels to hydrogen.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has accepted the four recommendations of the 2018 Joint Select Committee into Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander Peoples. This includes that a process of co-design be initiated across Australia to design a voice for Indigenous Australians and that the Government consider options to establish the voice after the process of co-design is complete.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government agrees it is important to develop a shared approach and vision for Constitutional recognition, with a real consensus that will deliver on the aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and be supported by the Australian people.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your emails of 19 October 2020 referring two petitions (EN1639 and EN1731) received by the Standing Committee on Petitions, regarding the Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students (the test).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For all teachers, no matter the year level or subjects they teach, strong personal literacy and numeracy skills form an essential part of the attributes and skills needed to be effective in the classroom. While personal literacy and numeracy skills are only one element of what makes a good teacher, they are critical to fostering the development of strong personal literacy and numeracy in students.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The requirement for students undertaking an initial teacher education program have personal literacy and numeracy skills that are in the top 30 per cent of the adult population was introduced by agreement of all Education Ministers. This requirement has been implemented through the Accreditation of Initial Teacher Education Programs in Australia: Standards and Procedures (the Standards and Procedures) since 2011, with the test being used since 2016 as the means for demonstrating a student has achieved this standard.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under Standard 3.5, higher education providers have a key role in the process. The Standard states that 'Entrants to initial teacher education will possess levels of personal literacy and numeracy broadly equivalent to the top 30 per cent of the population. Providers who select students who do not meet this requirement must establish satisfactory arrangements to ensure that these students are supported to achieve the required standard before graduation.'</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the test requirement is related to accreditation of initial teacher education programs and/or registration as a teacher, each state or territory is responsible for imposing the requirement relating to the test in that jurisdiction under the relevant state or territory legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This includes specifying how the test interacts with progression through an initial teacher education program and/or subsequent registration as a teacher. As a result, some states and territories have different requirements regarding the test. Students should contact the teacher regulatory body in their state or territory to confirm specific jurisdictional requirements, including requirements to sit the test at a particular point in their program. As states and territories manage accreditation of initial teacher education courses, the Australian Government is not able to grant exemptions to the test requirement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Even in these unprecedented times, maintaining an expectation of high-quality teaching is important. As such, the requirement for initial teacher education students to meet the standard of the test prior to graduation remains in place. The Australian Council for Educational Research, which administers the test, has put in place arrangements so that all people who need to sit the test in 2020 can do so. Further information about arrangements for the test is available online at www.teacheredtest.acer.edu.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government actively monitors the delivery of all national programs and commissioned an independent review of the implementation of the test. Decisions regarding the test implementation review are matters for all Education Ministers through Education Council and it is anticipated that it will be considered in December 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government remains committed to ensuring high quality graduates enter Australian classrooms. The test is an important component of providing this assurance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information regarding the test is available on the Department of Education, Skills and Employment's website at www.education.gov.au/literacy-and-numeracy-test-initial­teacher-education-students.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020, referring petition EN1643 regarding deaths in custody. I appreciate the signatories taking the time to petition the Australian Government on this important issue.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Every death in custody is a tragedy, and it is important for governments to consider the recommendations of reviews and inquiries, including those from coronial investigations, to ensure those in custody are kept safe and treated appropriately.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners may wish to visit the National Coronial Information System (NCIS), which may in part addresses the call for a database to include coronial findings on deaths in custody. It can accessed at: www.ncis.org.au. The NCIS was established in response to recommendations from the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and produces research to identify trends and similar cases nationally, and contribute to health policy development and prevention strategies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that the review by Deloitte Access Economics, cited in the petition, found significant progress has been made in implementing the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommendations, with 91 per cent of the recommendations for which the Australian Government had responsibility found to be fully or mostly implemented.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As states and territories are responsible for their police and justice systems, including protecting those in custody, the petitioners may wish to raise their concerns around specific coronial findings and Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommendations directly with jurisdictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths "in Custody found, the fundamental issue is that 'too many Aboriginal people are in custody too often'. Reducing the number of Indigenous Australians in contact with the justice system, through addressing the underlying factors that lead to offending, will reduce the number of lndigenous deaths in custody.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I believe we need a co-operative approach between governments, and with communities, to address issues raised by the Royal Commission, including factors that contribute to high incarceration rates for Indigenous Australians, through initiatives such as the National Agreement on Closing the Gap (the Agreement).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Agreement outlines a better way of working, with governments working in genuine partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to get better outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This means that there is shared decision making, shared responsibility and shared accountability to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The Agreement is also an important opportunity to address the issues raised in the petition, with all parties working to develop their Implementation Plans. More information can be found at: www.closingthegap.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners may be interested to know about actions already underway that aim to divert Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people away from the justice system. As part of the Morrison Government's commitment to work with states and territories, we have committed $261.3 million in 2020-21 to fund a range of activities to complement efforts by states and territories to improve justice and community safety outcomes for Indigenous Australians. These activities aim to reduce alcohol and other drug misuse; reduce re-offending; reduce family violence and promote Indigenous women's safety and leadership; improve wellbeing; create safe and functional environments; and improve community safety in remote Indigenous communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government has also offered to fund the establishment of a Custody Notification Service (CNS) in each state and territory, as an important safeguard recommended by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody to reduce the likelihood of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths in custody. The services provide culturally appropriate health and welfare support and basic legal advice for Indigenous Australians detained by police. Australian Government funded CNS' are operational in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Victoria, with a service soon to be established in South Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have also copied my colleagues the Attorney-General, the Hon Christian Porter MP and the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Peter Dutton MP, into this response given the links between the matters raised by the petitioners and their portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring this matter.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020 originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition Ministerial Referral (EN1655) to enact legislation to stop businesses not accepting cash. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As noted in the petition, the refusal by a business to accept payment in cash is not unlawful. The Australian Government has no plans to alter this approach, which is based on the principle that businesses can choose the terms upon which a sale (which is a contract between parties) of goods or services are offered, and consumers have the freedom to accept or refuse those terms by making or not making purchases with those businesses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The recent trend towards cashless payments is the result of consumers and businesses choosing the payment method that works best for them, with an increasing number of Australians preferring the convenience, security and versatility of cashless payment methods. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, some businesses are also encouraging consumers to pay via cashless methods (including tap n' go card payments) to promote the safety of their employees and reduce the risk of infection.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These changes have led to more businesses accepting cashless payments and an overall reduction in the use of cash for day to day payments. However, cash is still a vital part of our payment system and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government supports innovation and believes most Australians will benefit from cashless payments. However, the Government is also aware that cashless payment methods are not suitable for everyone and there are no plans to force Australia to become a cashless society. The Government is also committed to ensuring technological developments do not exclude vulnerable Australians from day to day activities. To this end, the Government continues to monitor developments in the payment system to ensure it remains accessible for all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistant to you.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 19 October 2020 to Minister Wood concerning Petition EN1664 to the House to reject the proposal for the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 to be effective from 1 July 2020. This matter has been referred to me as the Minister for Health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may be aware that the proposed restriction on the importation of personal nicotine vaporisers and, separately, nicotine for use in e-cigarettes has been deferred. This is in the context of the Therapeutics Goods Administration Delegate's consideration of the final decision on whether nicotine for all human use (except in nicotine replacement therapy and in tobacco packed and prepared for smoking) should be included in the Poisons Standard as a prescription only medicine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Delegate's primary reasons for the interim decision are to arrest the rapid uptake in use of e-cigarettes by youth whilst facilitating their simple and legal access for smoking cessation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To proceed, at the present time, with the amendment to the Customs Regulations (Prohibited Imports) would unnecessarily pre-empt any further deliberations the Delegate is required by the therapeutic goods regulatory framework to take in reaching that final decision.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will also monitor the impacts of the changes to the Poisons Standard if the Delegate's final decision confirms the interim decision.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 19 September 2020 regarding House of Representatives Petition EN1689 - Request to 'Reform' all current and future Royal Commissions to accommodate people who are disabled. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Royal Commissions are independent of the Government and have responsibility for determining operating procedures and the direction of the inquiry in accordance with the terms of reference. They operate under the Royal Commissions Act 1902. Ultimately the Commissioner/s are responsible for conducting the inquiry and determining processes. This means that each Royal Commission has its own unique identity and challenges.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is commonplace for the terms of reference to include a direction that Royal Commissioners have regard for putting in place arrangements that are accessible to support people who wish to share their experience. This is the case with two inquiries established under this Government that are currently on foot, the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability, and the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Administratively, Royal Commissions are a part of the Executive and operate under the auspices of my department. There is a legal requirement for the department to ensure services are usable and accessible to people with disabilities under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (DDA). With regards to online services, Australian Government agencies are further required to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA. This includes Royal Commissions, who are responsible for managing their own digital content.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are various complaints mechanisms available to individuals that believe they have been unlawfully discriminated against. If a person believes they have been unlawfully discriminated against, they may wish to consider lodging a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commission has the power to investigate and attempt to conciliate complaints of disability discrimination. If the conciliation is unsuccessful, in certain circumstances, a person may commence legal proceedings regarding the complaint in the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Circuit Court.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Information on the Commission's complaint handling process is available online at: </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, under the DDA, the Commission's functions include promoting_ an understanding of, and compliance with, the DDA and undertaking educational programs to promote the objects of the DDA. You wish to raise the concerns outlined in your correspondence with the Disability Commissioner in the Commission.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning petition EN1721 requesting the establishment of a Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in Australia in response to COVID-19. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has taken a strong and decisive approach in responding to COVID-19 based on the latest medical advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC). The relatively low number of COVID-19 cases in Australia is the result of the swift and successful implementation of public health measures.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to strengthen its disease isolation, surveillance and case-tracing procedures. Our emergency response arrangements are flexible and scalable, enabling my Department to take a tailored response to the evolving COVID-19 situation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This has been a difficult time for all Australians and I acknowledge that, while saving lives, our public health actions have come at an economic cost, affecting businesses and individuals. The Petitions Committee can be assured the Government continues to act decisively in the national interest to support households and businesses and address the significant economic consequences of the disease through the Australian Economic Recovery Plan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A national CDC would not add to Australia's proven expertise and capacity to effectively respond to national communicable disease outbreaks. Additional structures could risk overlap and duplication with existing communicable disease control functions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department through the Office of Health Protection and Response (Office), is leading the COVID-19 response. This Office, which is responsible for the operation of the National Incident Room, is staffed by a range of expert medical advisers (including a pathologist), epidemiologists, pandemic policy and logistics specialists, and is the central coordination area that utilises its networks to collaborate with internal and external experts and stakeholders, including state and territory governments, through established mechanisms, such as National Cabinet.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">National Cabinet is advised by the AHPPC. The AHPPC is supported by a number of expert advisory committees including the jurisdictionally based Public Health Laboratory Network (PHLN) and the Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">PHLN and CDNA are both comprised of directors and managers from Australian public health pathology laboratories and public health units. These networks, among several others, are providing technical advice on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Australian context, to inform response activities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Countries with CDC style arrangements do not appear to have better outcomes in the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of lives lost. For instance, as at 5 November 2020 Australia's death toll is 3.58 per 100,000 population. Whereas Spain (68.67 per 100,000), Sweden (57.89 per 100,000), Luxembourg (20.57 per 100,000) and Austria (9.19 per 100,000), as well as the United States (64.10 per 100,000), all have higher death rates. The key infectious disease centres for these countries being the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, respectively.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, in 2017 Australia voluntarily requested the World Health Organization undertake a Joint External Evaluation (JEE) as part of our ongoing commitment to the monitoring and evaluation of our core capacities under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The JEE review reported that Australia has a comprehensive system of capabilities and functions to prepare, detect and respond to health security threats and has fully implemented the necessary legislation to implement the IHR (2005). The JEE team commended Australia on our proactive support to other Member States in the region to achieve their core capacities under IHR (2005). The full JEE review, including results and priority actions, is available at:</span>

                </mc:AlternateContent>Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring to me petition EN1736 of 19 October 2020 regarding the reintroduction of the death penalty for the crimes of paedophilia and child sexual abuse.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that serious crimes are met with appropriate penalties, but has a long-standing policy of opposition to capital punishment. As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its Second Optional Protocol, Australia has an obligation not only to abolish the death penalty in its jurisdiction, but also to ensure that our laws and policies are consistent with those requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Parliament passed laws in March 2010 to extend the application of the current prohibition on the death penalty to state and territory laws. This ensures that the death penalty cannot be reintroduced anywhere in Australia in the future. ·</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to protecting the community from the dangers of child sex offenders and to ensuring sentencing practices reflect the harm suffered by victims of child sexual abuse. Australia has some of the most comprehensive child sexual abuse laws in the world. In 2019 and 2020, the Government introduced reforms to further strengthen the Commonwealth's framework of offences for child sexual abuse and ensure that the criminal justice response reflects the gravity of these crimes, the harm to victims and survivors, and the risks to the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Act 2020, strengthens existing laws to ensure that offenders are sufficiently punished and deterred, including through the introduction of mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious Commonwealth child sex offences and repeat child sex offenders. Whilst the Act also increases the maximum penalties for certain Commonwealth child sex offences, the mandato1y minimum sentences will ensure that courts are more likely to sentence child sex offenders to an appropriate period in prison for serious and subsequent offences, in line with community expectations.</span>
            </p>

As the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibility, your email has been forwarded to me for reply.</span>

They are designed to encourage people to undertake further education and training.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) is designed to help certain disadvantaged groups with the costs of study. Assistance is provided over a defined period to help recipients to gain an initial qualification, up to a postgraduate level, that would make them competitive in the labour market. To receive PES a person must be receiving a qualifying payment such as, but not limited to, Carer Payment, Disability Support Pension, or Parenting Payment Single and must also be undertaking an approved course of study in an accredited institution.</span>

Some supplementary benefits are available to part-time students. Assistance based on the Australian Postgraduate Awards model is also provided for students to undertake higher degrees at the masters and doctorate levels. There is also a Pensioner Education Supplement payable under ABSTUDY that reflects the Pensioner Education Supplement payable under Social Security law.</span>

The JobTrainer Fund includes $500 million from the Government for 2020-21, contingent on matched contributions from the states. This will provide around 340,700 additional training places to help job seekers and young people gain the skills they need to get a job.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your letter of 19 October 2020 concerning Petition EN1755, Royal Commission of inquiry into Australian Red Cross mismanagement of our nation's blood supply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has one of the safest blood supplies in the world. Effective and robust national arrangements are in place to manage the safety and quality of the Australian blood supply. Comprehensive care and treatment services are available through the National Blood Authority (NBA) for patients with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders, and national strategies and programs to address blood borne viruses including hepatitis and HIV continue to be implemented.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's strong commitment to eliminate hepatitis C as a public health threat is also clear through our investment of over $1 billion to provide access to curative direct acting antiviral (DAA) medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), to all eligible Australians regardless of how they acquired hepatitis C or their current circumstances. Since 2016, over 87,000 people living with chronic hepatitis C in Australia had received DAA treatment through the PBS.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, in 2015 the Australian House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health examined the prevalence, testing, treatment, prevention options, and cost impacts with treating hepatitis C. The Standing Committee's report: The Silent Disease -Report on the Inquiry into Hepatitis C in Australia recommended enhanced reporting, raising awareness of hepatitis C, improving testing and treatment regimens and reaching populations at high risk of infections. These recommendations continue to be implemented through the Fifth National Hepatitis C Strategy 2018-2022 that has been endorsed by all Australian governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Historically, there were crucial advances in the 1980s and early 1990s for identifying, and testing for, pathogenic blood-borne viruses (BBV), along with changes such as the uniting of separate state and territory based blood services into a national blood service in 1996.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The establishment of the NBA in 2003 to manage national arrangements for the safe and secure supply of blood, and blood products and services has led to the virtual elimination of the risk of transmission of BBV from a blood transfusion in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2004, the Australian Senate's Community Affairs Reference Committee examined extensively, the policies and practices of the Australian Red Cross and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in relation to the safety of the blood supply during the 1980s.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Reference Committee's report Hepatitis C and the Blood Supply in Australia found that the most effective way to address viral contamination in the Australian context was to improve access to services, education of medical personnel, and support research efforts to develop more effective treatments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This led to a range of initiatives to support patients who acquired hepatitis C from the blood supply, including ongoing funding through the NBA for the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood's Lookback program and Commonwealth contributions to state and territory hepatitis C settlement schemes. These initiatives continue today.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 19 October 2020 concerning Petition EN1794, which requested an increase to the number of sessions available under the Better Access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners (Better Access) through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) initiative and additional funding for Primary Health Networks (PHN) for the next four years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 October 2020 as part of the 2020-21 Federal Budget, the Australian Government announced $100.8 million to make available an additional 10 Medicare-subsidised individual psychological therapy sessions under the Better Access initiative. This means eligible people can now access up to 20 individual sessions each calendar year until 30 June 2022.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This investment was made by the Government in recognition of the severe and enduring mental health impacts the COVID-19 pandemic is having on many Australians. While the additional sessions have been available nationally since 9 October 2020, people subject to public health orders restricting their movement within a state or territory, including Victoria, have been able to access the additional sessions since 7 August 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department continues to work with health and system experts to monitor and review the implementation, use and impact of the temporary (Better Access) MBS items. This includes both the COVID-19 mental health response more broadly and the temporary telehealth measures. As recommended in the Productivity Commission's Report on Mental Health, which was released on 16 November 2020, the Government intends to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the Better Access initiative.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">PHNs are an integral part of the primary health care system. In recognition of the role PHNs play in commissioning mental health services, particularly for those at risk of poor health outcomes, PHNs are provided with flexible funding which enables PHNs to respond to identified regional priorities. These services include the provision of psychological therapies to underserviced groups that complements the Better Access initiative.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The recommendations from the Productivity Commission, together with the outcomes of my Department's work in monitoring and reviewing implementation of the Better Access initiative, will be essential in determining any reforms to the Better Access initiative and PHN funding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020 regarding Petition No EN1796, presented to the Standing Committee on Petitions, raising privacy concerns about websites that preserve and re-publish court lists containing the names of parties to family violence related proceedings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act) sets outs rights and obligations in relation to the collection, use, disclosure and handling of personal information. These are contained in</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). The Privacy Act generally applies to Commonwealth government agencies and certain private sector organisations with an annual turnover of $3 million or more, as well as certain smaller organisations where they deal specifically in personal information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Privacy Act applies to the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court only in relation to acts and practices of an administrative nature, such as information about the day-to-day running of these courts, which may include information about court staff, those who supply goods and services, complaints and feedback, and about security matters. It does not apply to documents and information that the courts hold for judicial purposes. This is information that the courts hold in records relating to cases. Instead, this information is protected under the Family Law Act and the applicable rules of court.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As identified in the petition, section 121 of the Family Law Act limits publication of identifying accounts of family law proceedings, with certain exceptions. One such exception is where a court authorises the publication. Any complaints in relation to how the Family Court or Federal Circuit Court lists matters or otherwise deals with personal information can be directed to the relevant court in the first instance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Circuit Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia both publish daily court lists of matters to be heard by the courts. Those lists are accessible electronically on the courts' respective websites and in hard copy in the foyer of family law court registries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The lists are accessible for a limited period of time. The lists identify the matters by stating the surname and initials of the given names of the parties. The lists do not identify issues to be heard or determined by the courts, such as whether the matter involves allegations of family violence. The publication of such lists by the courts is explicitly permitted by section 121.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A notice is published on both the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court websites, directly above the daily court lists, providing that under the Family Law Act, serious penalties can apply if section 121 is breached, and outlining that it is unlawful, in certain circumstances, to publish or disseminate the identity of parties and witnesses involved in family law proceedings and information relating to an account of those proceedings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition refers to the publication of court lists relating to domestic violence orders (DVOs). The laws relating to DVOs (however described) are the responsibility of state and territory governments and these matters are heard by state and territory courts. Similarly, criminal prosecutions for breaches of DVOs and other criminal offences relating to domestic, family and sexual violence are the responsibility of the states and territories. The prosecution of such offences are heard by state and territory courts. Concerns around the publication of court lists for such matters would be more appropriately raised with state and territory governments. As these proceedings do not arise under the Family Law Act, section 121 of the Act is not applicable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In respect of the website specifically referenced in the petition, 'Domestic Violence Court Records Australia', as at 24 November 2020, this database appears to have ceased operations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Privacy Act may apply to an entity if it meets the $3 million annual turnover threshold, or can be classified as a business that deals specifically in personal information. In the event of a complaint, whether the Privacy Act (and the APPs) apply to an entity would be for the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) to determine. If the Privacy Act does apply, the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) prevent an entity from collecting personal information unless the information is reasonably necessary for, or directly related an entity's functions or activities (APP 3). In addition, an entity must take reasonable steps to notify an individual of the collection of personal information (APP 5) and must not use or disclose such information for a purpose other than the primary purpose of collection, unless the individual to whom the personal information relates has consented or an exception applies. An entity must take reasonable steps to protect personal information that it holds from misuse, interference and loss, as well as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure (APP 11).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The OAIC is responsible for investigating breaches of the Privacy Act. If there is a concern that an entity is breaching the APPs, a complaint could be made to the OAIC. Information on how to make a privacy complaint, as well further information on the Privacy Act, is available from the OAIC website at: www.oaic.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Of general relevance to the petition, the Government has established a Joint Select Committee to inquire into the family law system. On 7 October 2020, the Committee released an interim rep01i covering a broad range of topics consistent with its terms of reference. The Committee is scheduled to deliver its final report by the last sitting day in February 2021. The interim report, the Committee's terms of reference and further information about the inquiry are available from the Committee's website at:</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Lastly, the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC), in its report Family Law for the Future -An Inquiry into the Family Law System (March 2019) recommended that the Australian Government amend section 121 of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) to ensure that the public are aware of their obligations under the Act (recommendation 56). Section 121 provides for the non-publication of identifying accounts for family law proceedings subject to certain exceptions, including court approval. The Government is considering and will respond to the ALRC's report and its 60 recommendations in the near future.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your letter of 19 October 2020 concerning Petition EN1801—Right for non-vaccinated persons to be able to travel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government supports immunisation in recognition that it is a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or sometimes even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to providing all Australians with access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines as soon as available. A COVID-19 vaccine is the best way to protect the Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is overwhelming support for a strong stance on immunisation and the Government has formed the view that the benefits of vaccination to the community are sufficiently important to underpin certain policy decisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government supports immunisation, it is not compulsory, and people maintain the right to choose whether to vaccinate themselves and their family.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any decisions regarding the availability of a potential COVID-19 vaccine and related policies will be based on the advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, COVID-19 Vaccine and Treatments for Australia - Science and Industry Technical Advisory Group and other experts, and will be contingent on a vaccine candidate meeting all requirements with regard to testing and safety.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Vaccines, like any other medicines can have side effects, however all vaccines used within Australia provide benefits which greatly outweigh their risks. A number of organisations including the Australian Academy of Science, an independent scientific body, have produced documents such as The Science of Immunisation: Questions and Answers which the petition authors may be interested in, available at: www .science.org.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has invested in AusVaxSafety, the national, monitoring and surveillance system which actively monitors vaccine safety throughout Australia. Current results are available on their website at: www.ausvaxsafety.org.au. Parents/carers and immunisation providers can also report adverse events to the Therapeutic Goods Administration via the Adverse Event Management System at: www.tga.gov.au</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, a vaccine for COVID-19 does not currently exist. If and when a vaccine becomes available, decisions on how to best implement a vaccination program will be made taking into account all available public health, medical and epidemiological data available at that time.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020 originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition Ministerial Referral (EN1805) request to extend the current rates of JobSeeker and JobKeeper Payments. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to temporary, targeted and scalable support during the COVID-19 pandemic that balances additional financial assistance for job seekers with incentives to work, and taking account of public health advice. On 10 November 2020, the Prime Minister and Minister for Social Services announced the extension of the Coronavirus Supplement at a rate of $150 per fortnight from 1 January 2021 to 31 March 2021. This decision was informed by economic conditions and the experience with the changes to JobSeeker that applied from 25 September 2020, striking a balance between providing an elevated level of support for people who need it with incentives for people to re-engage with the workforce.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Other temporary income support measures will also continue until March 2021, including the higher income free area, the relaxed partner income test taper rate, expanded eligibility criteria and waiving of certain waiting periods.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With regards to the JobKeeper Payment, on 21 July 2020, the Government announced an extension to the JobKeeper Payment for a further six months until 28 March 2021 with changes made to eligibility criteria and payment amounts to ensure the program remains targeted to those businesses and employees most significantly impacted by COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The wage subsidy amount is being stepped down as part of the extension to continue to support those businesses who require additional support, while also helping businesses adjust and gradually transition from the JobKeeper Payment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Two payment tiers were introduced from 28 September 2020 to better align the JobKeeper Payment with an employee's usual income. The lower JobKeeper Payment rate is paid for those who worked for less than 20 hours per week on average over four weeks prior to either 1 March 2020 or 1 July 2020. Having two tiers strikes a balance between making payments more aligned with usual hours worked while limiting complexity for employers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 28 September 2020 to 3 January 2021, the payment rate will be $1,200 per fortnight for those working an average of 20 hours or more per week in the test period prior to either 1 March 2020 or 1 July 2020 and $750 per fortnight for all others.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 4 January 2021 to 28 March 2021, the payment rates for these cohorts will be $1,000 per fortnight and $650 per fortnight.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 19 October 2020 to the Attorney-General, the Hon Christian Porter MP, Minister for Industrial Relations, regarding petition number EN1806, which asks the House of Representatives to legislate a ban on unpaid internships. As the issue raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities as Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, your email has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has strong safeguards and protections in place to support appropriate work experience opportunities, which can come in many forms and in certain circumstances can include unpaid internship placements. Genuine unpaid work experience arrangements provide students, recent graduates and other job seekers with valuable industry or professional experience and contacts which makes them more employable. Unpaid work experience may include vocational placements or volunteer arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009, </span>whether a person is an employee or an unpaid intern depends on whether an employment relationship exists, under the common law test, or if an arrangement involves a vocational placement. If an employment relationship exists then the employee is entitled to conditions under the Fair Work Act, including minimum wages, the National Employment Standards (NES) and provisions under the applicable award or enterprise agreement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not condone any sort of sham working arrangements and has zero tolerance for the exploitation of any employee no matter their age, nationality or visa status. All employees are entitled to the basic workplace rights and protections under the Fair Work Act. This includes the NES, redress for wage underpayments and general protections against workplace discrimination and harassment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) has a range of educational and enforcement tools to promote and ensure compliance with workplace laws. Education and engagement by the FWO is vitally important to inform Australians about their workplace rights, and is backed up by strong enforcement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The FWO provides free advice and assistance, including dedicated fact sheets about unpaid work on its website at www.fairwork.gov.au/how-we-will-help/templates-and-guides/fact­sheets/unpaid-work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If any employee has concerns about their employment conditions or entitlements, including pay and conditions, they should contact the FWO for assistance on 13 13 94. A telephone interpreter service is also available on 13 14 50 and a hearing and speech impairment service on 13 36 77. Employees can also report concerns anonymously in English or another language using the FWO's online reporting tool at www.fairwork.gov.au/how-we-will­help/how-we-help-you/anonymous-tipoff.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to providing job seekers with the support they need to move into work. Government-funded work experience opportunities are helping to level the playing field by assisting Australians from all socioeconomic backgrounds to access the benefits of work experience.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to invest strongly in a number of work experience and internship programs. For example, the Youth Jobs PaTH (Prepare, Trial, Hire) program helps young job seekers aged 17-24 gain valuable skills and experience through voluntary internships of four to twelve weeks duration. Participants in PaTH Internships receive an incentive payment of $200 per fortnight on top of their regular income support. Since the start of the program in April 2017, over 14,400 PaTH internships have been commenced with 65.6 per cent of those who completed their internships achieving a job placement immediately after their internship, and a further 8.2 per cent achieving a job placement within three months.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the issues raised by the petitioners also fall within the portfolio responsibilities of the Attorney-General, I have forwarded a copy of the petition and this response for his information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 19 October 2020 regarding a petition requesting that hydroxychloroquine be made available over the counter (Petition Number EN1819).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">By way of background, the circumstances under which medicines can be accessed by the Australian public are determined through a classification process known as 'scheduling'. Medicines and chemicals are classified into schedules, which are published in the Poisons Standard. Classification is based on the risk of harm and the level of access control required to protect public health and safety. The scheduling process is managed by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) which is part of my Department. Scheduling decisions are made by a senior medical officer at the TGA acting as a delegate of the Secretary of the Department of Health. These are not decisions of the Minister for Health or the Australian Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, hydroxychloroquine has been assessed as a prescription only medicine because it is used for conditions that require the diagnosis and intervention from a medical practitioner. Hydroxychloroquine is approved to treat malaria and certain autoimmune conditions, including Lupus. It is important to be aware that hydroxychloroquine can have serious side effects, including cardiac toxicity (potentially leading to sudden heart attacks), irreversible eye damage and severe depletion of blood sugar (potentially leading to coma). As such, it is appropriate for hydroxychloroquine to remain a prescription medicine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">After COVID-19 emerged, there was a sudden increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine in the community which resulted in some patients not being able to fill their regular prescriptions. As such, prescribing restrictions were</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce is closely monitoring clinical studies in Australia and around the world that are investigating the use of potential COVID-19 treatments, including hydroxychloroquine. This taskforce comprises 29 peak health professional bodies whose members are providing clinical care to people with COVID-19. The taskforce undertakes continuous surveillance to identify and rapidly synthesise emerging research in order to provide national, evidence-based guidelines for the clinical care of people with COVID-19. You can view the taskforce guidelines at: www.covid19evidence.net.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Based on the current available evidence, my Department strongly discourages the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent COVID-19, unless the patient is enrolled in a clinical trial which will have safety monitoring protocols and oversight by a Human Research Ethics Committee. Information on clinical trials for hydroxychloroquine being undertaken in Australia can be found on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trails Registry at: www.anzctr.org.au/TrialSearch.aspx using the search term 'hydroxychloroquine'.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Similar to my Department's and TGA's current position on the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19, the US FDA has cautioned against the use ofCOVID-19 outside of hospital or clinical trial settings, due to the risk of adverse effects. The UK medicines regulator has suspended recruitment to all studies of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment or prevention ofCOVID-19.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 19 October 2020 concerning Petition EN1820—End state of emergency across Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is taking a strong and decisive approach in responding to COVID-19, based on the latest medical advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate this is a very difficult time for all Australians, especially for those citizens who have concerns about possible delays in returning home, as well as impacts from being unable to visit friends and family interstate and overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world have taken unprecedented steps to contain the outbreak and respond to its impacts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The human biosecurity emergency period in place under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015 </span>(Act) is made through a non-disallowable instrument, and the House of Representatives is unable to make decisions on its timing. Instead, the Act vests the Governor-General with these powers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 18 March 2020, the Governor-General declared the human biosecurity emergency in relation to COVID-19 under section 475 of the Act. The Governor-General has extended the hum.an biosecurity emergency period on two occasions, and it is currently in place until 17 December 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All changes to the human biosecurity emergency period are made on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer and the AHPPC. The current medical evidence establishes that COVID-19 is continuing to pose a severe and immediate threat to human health, on a significant scale both internationally and domestically. AHPPC has noted with particular concern the continued escalation of case numbers internationally.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In my capacity as the Minister for Health, the human biosecurity emergency declaration enables me to determine emergency requirements or issue directions to respond to COVID-19.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">An exact time period for how long the emergency period and travel restrictions under the Act will remain in force is unable to be determined at this time. Opening our borders too soon could see a resurgence in cases, undoing progress and placing strain on healthcare resources and systems. The Government is currently considering when and how to reopen our borders safely. However, this will be a step-by-step process underpinned by the latest medical advice and based on robust risk assessments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the Act, it is important to note that state and territory governments have primary operational responsibility for emergency management and public health in their jurisdictions, which is based on the medical advice from their respective Chief Health Officers. The specific measures imposed to control the spread of COVID-19 in each state and territory, including managing restrictions on the movement of residents within a state/territory, is the responsibility of the respective jurisdiction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is a strong supporter of immunisation. It is a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death. Vaccination however is not mandatory and individuals maintain the option and right to choose not to vaccinate. This right will extend to any COVID-19 vaccination that may become available. It is important that everyone who can benefit from a COVID-19 vaccine, can access it to protect themselves, their loved ones and their community.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Petitions Committee can be assured that the Government, along with the states and territories, is taking an evidence-based approach to COVID-19, and is committed to keep Australians safe.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 9 November 2020 to the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, regarding petition number EN1853 which calls on the Commonwealth Parliament to issue a citizen initiated national referendum for the establishment of an Australian Republic, based on the model of the Australian Republican Movement. The Prime Minister has asked me to respond on his behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister has expressed his support for current constitutional arrangements. As you may be aware, any proposal to amend the Australian Constitution needs widespread community support to succeed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I add that, contrary to the suggestion in the petition, under the current constitutional arrangements, Australia is a sovereign, independent and federal nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A move to a republic, with an Australian Head of State, would require a change to the Australian Constitution through a Constitutional referendum. The process for altering the Australian Constitution is set out in section 128 of the Constitution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Citizen Initiated Referendum Bill 2013 referenced in the petition did not pass through Parliament and was therefore never enacted into law. It lapsed at the end of the 43rd Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government respects the right of all Australians to continue to express their views on these matters.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing this petition to the attention of the Prime Minister. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government, together with the state and territory governments, is committed to reducing the prevalence of smoking and its associated health, social and economic costs, and the inequalities it causes. In line with this commitment, the Government has set a target of reducing smoking rates below 10 per cent by 2025.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">There is strong evidence that comprehensive public health strategies focussing on both the supply and demand of tobacco are most likely to achieve long-term health gains, prevent the uptake of smoking and reduce smoking prevalence. This comprehensive approach has led to historically low smoking rates in Australia, particularly among children and youth. At the national level, the Government's tobacco control measures include tobacco excise and excise-equivalent customs duty; education programs and campaigns; plain packaging of</span>

Supporting Australians to eat a healthy, balanced diet is a complex public health issue with multiple contributing factors requiring community-wide approaches as well as behaviour change by individuals.-The Government's preferred approach is to actively educate, support and encourage Australians to adopt and maintain a healthy diet, rather than introducing additional regulations and taxes.</span>

The Government has rapidly scaled medical advice, care and treatment to meet the unique demands ofCOVID-19, protect the most vulnerable and keep Australians well, including looking after their mental health and wellbeing.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the burden of overweight and obesity in Australia. Obesity is a complex condition influenced by multiple factors (individual, social and environmental).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As such, implementing a fine for those over a certain BMI level is not appropriate and is unlikely to be successful in reducing the prevalence of obesity in Australia. Addressing overweight and obesity in Australia requires a multi-faceted, community wide approach delivered through a range of initiatives and organisations.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Action is required at all levels of government, with a focus on population-level interventions and the environmental factors which are contributing to the issue. Other organisations, such as non-government or community organisations, also have a role to play by delivering community led targeted interventions.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In recognition of the importance of this issue, all Australian Health Ministers have agreed to the development of a national obesity strategy (strategy) to enable a more collaborative and comprehensive national approach to obesity in Australia. The Queensland Department of Health is leading the development of the strategy, in close collaboration with all jurisdictions. It is expected the strategy will include a focus on priority population groups or regions where the prevalence of overweight and obesity is higher. Public consultation to inform the development of the strategy was undertaken in late 2019 and early 2020. More than 2000 individuals and organisations engaged in the consultation. The draft strategy is expected to be considered by Health Ministers in early 2021</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 9 November 2020 concerning Petition EN1895—ethical concerns on the use of foetal cell lines in the development of COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges that there are faith-based concerns in relation to some COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in development. In particular these concerns relate to the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, for which a production and supply agreement was announced on 7 September 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government understands that the Oxford vaccine candidate is produced from a cell line that was developed from foetal tissue in the 1970s. I can assure you that there are strong ethical regulations around the use of any human cell, particularly human foetal cells.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Other vaccines available in Australia that are manufactured using cell lines that originally came from foetal tissue include rubella, hepatitis A, varicella (chickenpox) and rabies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has signed a number of production and supply agreements for access to COVID-19 vaccines, in addition to the Oxford vaccine candidate. On 7 September 2020, an agreement for the University of Queensland/CSL COVID-19 vaccine candidate was announced. On 5 November 2020, the Government announced two additional agreements for the supply of promising COVID-19 vaccines from Novavax and Pfizer/BioNTech. None of these three vaccine candidates make use of cell lines derived from a human foetus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand the concerns outlined in the petition concerning the individual's right to choose, on ethical grounds, whether to vaccinate. The Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as it is a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death. While the Government supports immunisation, the COVID-19 vaccine will not be mandatory and individuals maintain the option to choose not to vaccinate. The vaccine will be available for free to those who choose to be vaccinated.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 November 2020 concerning the petition requesting the repeal of section 487 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) to eliminate the ability of green charitable groups to mount costly challenges to Adani's operations (EN1902).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the EPBC Act, projects which may have, will have or are likely to have a significant impact on a nationally protected matter are subject to a rigorous evidence-based environmental assessment and approval process. Legal review mechanisms under the EPBC Act help ensure that assessment and approval decisions are made in a robust, transparent and accountable manner that the community can have confidence in.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2015, the Australian Government introduced a Bill to repeal section 487 of the EPBC Act which provides extended standing to environmental organisations to seek judicial review of EPBC Act decisions. The Bill lapsed when Parliament was prorogued in 2016.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In his Interim Report of the Independent Review of the EPBC Act, Professor Graeme Samuel AC noted that the Review has received highly conflicting evidence and viewpoints about the appeal mechanisms under the EPBC Act. Professor Samuel went on to state that the Review is not yet convinced that extending standing should be curtailed. The Government is now in the process of considering the recommendations of the Final Report of the Independent Review of the EPBC Act.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The opioid reforms are vital to prevent inappropriate prescribing as well as reducing the risk of dependence and overdose. Over the past decade, Australians have experienced a significant increase in the level of harm and deaths arising from the use of pharmaceutical opioids. Every day in Australia, nearly 150 hospitalisations and 14 emergency department admissions involve issues relating to opioid use, and three people die from the harm that results from inappropriate use, more information is available at: </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is something the Australian Government and I, as the Minister for Health, are deeply committed to avoiding. The wider challenge of delivering effective pain management cannot come at the expense of addressing this urgent matter, hence the recent changes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 1 June 2020, the PBS listings for opioid medications underwent a number of changes as recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These were recommended in response to the Therapeutic Goods Administration's regulatory reforms implemented to minimise the harms caused by opioid prescription medicines to Australians each year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">PBS-subsidised opioids can continue to be prescribed for the treatment of patients with chronic pain, provided other analgesic medications do not, or will not provide sufficient pain management, or where other analgesic medications are contraindicated or not tolerated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Prescribers are able to request authority approval from Services Australia for increased quantities and or repeats of PBS-subsidised opioids. These increases may extend treatment up to three months' supply per prescription.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Patients requiring authority for increased quantities and repeats must have an annual review of their condition conducted by a second medical practitioner to confirm ongoing need for opioid medication when they have been receiving treatment with opioids for 12 months or longer. This secondary consult is an annual requirement only where increased quantities and or repeats of opioid medication are required. The annual review does not need to be undertaken by a pain specialist; any Australian registered medical practitioner will suffice. In recognition of the difficulties for patients to see their doctors due to COVID-19, the secondary review may also be undertaken by phone or telehealth consultation where appropriate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following the implementation of these changes, the PBAC considered feedback from Palliative Care Australia expressing concerns regarding barriers to pain management for palliative care patients. The PBAC subsequently recommended additional changes to the opioid listings for palliative care patients and restructured the existing opioid restrictions to reduce the administrative burden on prescribers. These changes were implemented on 1 October 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 October 2020, patients who are receiving palliative care whose clinical condition is such that they are unable to seek a secondary annual review will be exempted from this requirement. For those palliative patients who are well enough to meet this requirement, a palliative care nurse practitioner will be also able to conduct annual reviews.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is a priority of the Australian Government to provide all Australians access to safe, effective and affordable medicines. The PBS is a funding program that enables Australians to access medicines at a subsidised cost in the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Improved Monitoring of Entitlements (IME) measure ensures that only eligible Australian Residents receive PBS subsidised medicines. This measure helps ensure taxpayers dollars go to those who are entitled to them. The IME checks the patient's entitlement arrangements. This reduces the number of subsidies paid to ineligible people. A person may be ineligible if they are a visitor from a country without a Reciprocal Health Care Agreement or an illegal immigrant.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The co-payment is the amount the patient pays towards the cost of their PBS subsidised medicine. Many PBS medicines cost significantly more than the co-payment amount.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 9 November 2020 concerning petition EN1934 requesting Australians be allowed to travel overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that this is a challenging time with significant uncertainty, particularly for people wishing to travel overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is taking a strong and decisive approach in responding to COVID-19, informed by the latest medical advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC). The relatively low number ofCOVID-19 cases in Australia is the result of the swift and successful implementation of public health measures;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has introduced strict border and quarantine measures to protect the health of the Australian community. The purpose of the restriction is to control the spread of COVID-19 through Australia's international ports. Since the ban first came into force on 20 March 2020, it has continued to be effective in helping to achieve this purpose. These requirements are managed and enforced by state and territory governments with Australian Government support, including from the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Border Force.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is unable to provide an exact time period for how long the travel restriction will remain in force. The medical experts guiding our response, the AHPPC, recently reviewed the quarantine arrangements and agreed that risk ofCOVID-19 in travellers returning from many countries is increasing, reinforcing the importance of hotel quarantine. The Government is considering when and how to reopen our borders safely. However, it will be a step-by-step process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Foreign countries may have also diminished capacity as a result of the pandemic, including in relation to health systems and consular assistance. Australians overseas may not be able to access health care or diplomatic support.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to promoting and protecting human rights, including freedom of religion and freedom of belief for all people. We remain concerned religious groups in China, including Falun Gong practitioners, continue to be targeted on the basis of their beliefs. We have regularly raised our concerns about this issue with China, including at ministerial level, both directly and in international fora. We will continue to do so while serious human rights abuses continue.</span>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is carefully monitoring developments on this issue, and regularly reviews available evidence as new reports are published. We are aware organs have been harvested from executed prisoners in China for use in medical transplants, at least prior to 2015. Australia strongly opposes this practice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to preventing organ trafficking. Since 2004, the Government has had a comprehensive strategy to combat such crimes and is committed to ensuring that Australia's response to organ trafficking and transplant tourism remains as effective as possible. Australia's states and territories have robust frameworks in place to regulate lawful donation and transplants of human organs and tissue for therapeutic purposes.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your email of 19 October 2020 regarding House of Representatives Petition PN485, which requests that the House of Representatives address issues around Indigenous incarceration and Aboriginal deaths in custody. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this petition to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Every death in custody is a tragedy. While state and territory governments are primarily responsible for many of the drivers of Indigenous incarceration, including criminal law enforcement and prison policies and practices, the Australian Government is committed to working with jurisdictions to find effective solutions to address the disproportionate contact of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with the justice system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Legal Assistance Partnership 2020-25 </span>(NLAP), the Government will provide more than $2 billion to the states and territories for Commonwealth funded legal assistance. Frontline legal assistance services will be delivered by legal aid commissions, community legal centres, and Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILS). Of the $2 billion, $440 million is being provided specifically to ATSILS to deliver specialised culturally safe and culturally appropriate legal assistance to Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander Australians. The new legal assistance funding arrangements provide an increase of more than $20 million in legal assistance funding to ATSILS.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">An important initiative through which the Government is working with states and territories to address the drivers of Indigenous incarceration is the National Agreement on Closing the Gap (the National Agreement). All governments have worked in partnership with the Coalition of Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander Peak Organisations and agreed to targets for reducing the rates of youth detention and adult incarceration. This National Agreement is an important oppo1iunity to consider the issues raised in the petition, such as re-visiting recommendations of previous reviews including the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and their implications for social and justice systems.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, as part of the Government's commitment to work with states and territories, $266.7 million in 2020-21 has been committed under the Indigenous Advancement Strategy through the Minister for Indigenous Australians' portfolio to fund a range of activities to complement efforts by states and territories to improve justice and community safety outcomes for Indigenous Australians. These efforts aim to reduce alcohol and other drug misuse; reduce re-offending; reduce family violence and promote Indigenous women's safety and leadership; improve wellbeing; create safe and functional environments; and improve community safety in remote Indigenous communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has also offered to fund the establishment of a Custody Notification Service in each state and territory as an important safeguard to reduce the likelihood of Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander deaths in custody. The service was recommended by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and provides culturally appropriate health and welfare support and basic legal advice for Indigenous Australians detained by police. Services are operational in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Victoria, with a service soon to be established in South Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, in response to the issues raised in the petition about raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14, the Council of Attorneys-General agreed to establish a working group to examine this issue in November 2018. The Australian Government will consider, amongst other issues, the need for adequate processes and services for children who exhibit offending behaviour once the working group's report is finalised. Ultimately, it will be a decision for each jurisdiction whether to raise the minimum age.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust the above information provides a helpful overview of the policies and programs the Australian Government has in place to address the important issues raised by this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email to the Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon Christian Porter MP regarding Petition EN1220 requesting that the House of Representatives enact a Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability law substantially similar to United States' version. In addition, I refer to Petition EN0994 requesting that the House of Representatives support the introduction and passage of legislation establishing a Magnitsky-style human rights sanctions regime. As this matter falls within my portfolio responsibility, the petitions have been passed to me.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have asked the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to inquire into the use of targeted sanctions to address human rights abuses. This includes considering the establishment in Australia of a global 'Magnitsky-style' human rights sanctions regime to complement those introduced in the United Kingdom and United States.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee has received more than 150 public submissions, and heard from a number of witnesses in public hearings. As a longstanding supporter of protections for individual human rights and freedoms, I have been pleased by the strong interest in the Committee's inquiry.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I expect the Committee to report later this year. The Government will carefully consider the Committee's recommendations once received.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Murray-Darling Basin</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your emails of 24 August 2020 on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions, regarding petitions EN1038 and EN1124. The petitions concerned fish deaths in the Murray-Darling River and called for an independent Federal Royal Commission into water theft and mismanagement of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The fish deaths in the Murray-Darling Basin in summer 2018-19 were a terrible reminder of the effects drought and limited water flows can have on the environment and rural communities. Last year the Australian Government appointed an independent panel, chaired by Professor Rob Vertessy, to assess the fish deaths in the lower Darling. The panel found that low dissolved oxygen levels caused by factors such as the breakdown of water layers, decomposition of organic matter, algal blooms, and high temperatures followed by cooler periods, contributed to the fish deaths.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In response, the Government announced more than $93 million to help improve river health and assist the long-term recovery of fish stocks. This includes $5 million for development of a Native Fish Management Recovery Strategy, $15 million for fencing northern riverbanks, $10 million for new fish hatcheries, $20 million to expand Murray-Darling Basin scientific research, $25 million for water metering in the northern Basin and $5 million for river level video cameras. These initiatives are currently being delivered across the Basin.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not support calls to establish a Federal Royal Commission into the Basin Plan. The response to the Vertessy Panel inquiry into the fish deaths was comprehensive. Several other reviews have also taken place recently into Murray-Darling Basin water management. These include the Interim Inspector-General of Murray-Darling Basin Water Resources' inquiry into water sharing arrangements in the southern Basin, the independent assessment of social and economic conditions in the Basin and the First Review of the Water for the Environment Special Account. We do not need another review that would divert valuable resources from the important task of implementing the Basin Plan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are taking these reviews seriously and intend to work closely with Basin state and territory governments to find solutions. The Murray-Darling Communities Investment Package I announced on 4 September 2020 outlines the Government's refreshed approach to put communities and jobs at the heart of the Basin Plan. The package contains 11 actions that will help improve community and river health, build trust, transparency and accountability, and improve implementation of the Basin Plan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the Government is committed to delivering the highest accountability for managing our scarce water resources. We will do this by establishing a statutory and independent Inspector­General of Water Compliance, a key action of the Investment Package. The Inspector-General will aim to improve trust and transparency in implementing the Commonwealth's Basin water reform, strengthen the Basin Plan compliance and enforcement efforts and deliver greater consistency and harmonisation of water regulation across the Basin.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Newstart Allowance</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Brien</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 25 November 2019, concerning petition EN1094 presented to the House of Representatives, regarding Newstart Allowance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners raise concerns that Newstart Allowance is inadequate for covering living costs in Australia and call for an increase of the rate. Additionally, the petitioners recommend a broad based review of Newstart and other social security payments, with further increases to follow if warranted by the review findings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian social security system aims to support the basic living standards of all Australians and increase their social and economic participation. The Australian Government is committed to a welfare system that supports the most vulnerable, encourages those who are able to work or study to do so, and is sustainable for future generations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Newstart Allowance is the main income support payment for people of workforce age, while they are unemployed. It is designed to provide a safety net for people who require financial assistance, and to provide incentives to enable them to join or return to the workforce. One of the Government's key objectives is to ensure that people who have the capacity to work and support themselves do so, to the fullest extent possible.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Newstart Allowance, like most social security payments, is means-tested and operates in conjunction with taxation concessions, productivity initiatives, employment services and labour market strategies, as part of an integrated package to support workforce participation objectives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The rate of Newstart Allowance is indexed twice a year in March and September, in line with movements in the cost of living as measured by the Consumer Price Index. Payment rate increases are calculated according to provisions in social security legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A higher rate of Newstart Allowance is payable to single recipients with dependent children and those aged 60 years and over after nine continuous months on payment. The maximum fortnightly amount at this higher rate is $620.40 a fortnight. This fortnightly amount includes the maximum base rate of $604.70, the Energy Supplement of $9.50 and Pharmaceutical Allowance of $6.20.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to Newstart Allowance, recipients may also receive a range of additional benefits and concessions to increase their economic security, depending on their particular circumstances. These benefits include:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">a) assistance for people who rent in the private rental market, through the Commonwealth Rent Assistance payments;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">b) Family Tax Benefit for those raising dependent children;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">c) subsidised prescription medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">d) subsidised health care and related products; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">e) concessions provided by state and territory governments. Concessions offered vary between states and may include subsidies for electricity, gas and water, and reduced public transport and vehicle registration fees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for raising this matter with me. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 11 February 2020 regarding Petition EN1156. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia must play its part in the global response to climate change and we are doing our bit. Australia's emissions were coming down before the pandemic and are continuing to fall. In fact:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia's emissions are lower than when the Coalition came to Government in 2013.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia's emissions are now almost 17 per cent below 2005 levels (the year from which our 2030 Paris target is measured). This compares favourably with other countries like Canada and New Zealand, whose emissions declined less than 1 per cent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia's emissions are now at their lowest level since 1998.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement, and our aim is to achieve net zero emissions as soon as possible. That is why our focus is on driving down the costs of key technologies that will make net zero emissions achievable here and globally.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's Technology Investment Roadmap will accelerate the development of new and emerging technologies that will create jobs, lower energy prices and reduce emissions. The Roadmap will guide the deployment of an expected $18 billion of Government investment over the next 10 years. Together with other levels of government, research institutions and the private sector, the Government is aiming to leverage at least $70 billion of new investment by 2030.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This investment will create over 130,000 jobs by 2030, more than half of these in regional areas. Getting these technologies right will significantly reduce emissions from sectors like energy, transport, industry and agriculture. These sectors account for around 90 per cent of global emissions and emit 45 billion tonnes each year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Looking forward, Australia's 2030 target is for a 26-28 per cent reduction on 2005 levels. On a per person basis, our target is more ambitious than the European Union, Germany, Canada, New Zealand or Japan have committed to over the same period. Our 2030 target is a floor on our ambition, not a cap.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a world leader in renewable energy. We have invested more than $30 billion in renewable energy since 2017. In 2019, Australia deployed new renewable energy 10 times faster per person than the global average and four times faster than Europe, China, Japan or the US. About two million—one in four—Australian households now have solar panels on their roof. Last year, the share of wind and solar in Australia's electricity grids was more than double the global average and projected to rise rapidly in coming years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">One of the great challenges in the climate and emissions debate is recognising that we can only solve this problem together. At 1.3 per cent of emissions, Australia has almost no impact even if it eliminates all emissions. Other countries, particularly in the developing world, are reluctant to commit to policies and targets with material economic costs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia can play a leading role on the international stage by partnering with other nations to accelerate technologies. Real global action through technology, not taxes, is the pathway to realising strong economic and emissions outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information has been of assistance. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 11 February 2020 regarding the petition EN1184 presented to the House of Representatives on nuclear energy policy, nuclear regulation and construction of nuclear power stations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Liberal National Government recognises that nuclear energy is a mature technology used to deliver reliable electricity in many countries, with virtually no greenhouse gas emissions. Given the global significance of Australia's uranium reserves, the Government supports the sustainable development and responsible use of these important energy sources.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Last year, I asked the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy to inquire into the prerequisites for a future government to use nuclear energy in Australia. This is the first inquiry into the use of nuclear power in Australia in more than a decade.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In December 2019, the Committee presented its report - <span style="font-style:italic;">Not without your approva</span><span style="font-style:italic;">l: a way forward fo</span><span style="font-style:italic;">r nuclear technology in Australia.</span> The Government is currently considering the report and the Committee's recommendations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While we acknowledge the work of the Committee, the Government has no plans to lift the long-standing moratorium on nuclear energy in Australia. Any decision to remove the current prohibition on nuclear power generation would require bipartisan agreement and widespread community support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your email dated 9 April 2020 addressed to the Minister for Government Services, the Hon Stuart Robert MP, regarding a petition to ask the House to declare 27 May the new official date for 'Australia Day' (EN1309). I have been asked to respond on behalf of the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Day is an opportunity to bind as a nation, where we can reflect, respect and celebrate because we are all part of the story of Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Day is an opportunity to reflect on our shared history and 60,000 year plus journey and an important day to reflect on the impact European settlement had on Indigenous Australians and their way of life. It is a day to respect our different views and backgrounds, by sharing our stories and listening to others. And it is a day to celebrate our nation, its achievements and its people, our resilience in the face of adversity and to better understand the Westminster foundations of our free and fair democracy and the rule of law that underpins who we are as a people.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On occasion the Government has heard some suggestions, such as the request of this petition, to change the date of Australia Day. Whilst I thank the petitioners for their suggestion, it is the Government's view that Australia Day should continue to be celebrated annually on 26 January.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Recently Australia has faced harsh challenges—drought, floods, Black Summer bushfires and the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic. Australia Day 2021 will be a day to reflect, respect and celebrate the contribution all Australians have made in 2020 and mark our nation's resilience and the ability of Australians to rise above these and other challenges. It will also be an opportunity to celebrate our national heroes.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the Prime Minister said when confirming Australia Day 2021 as a day of thanks for those who have helped our nation through the pandemic: <span style="font-style:italic;">"It would be hard to nominate an Australian who in some way large or small has not had their lives impacted, disrupted by the pandemic. It has called on the bigness of Australians and I think that is something we can genuinely give thanks for and to celebrate our resilient character".</span></span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 15 April 2020, concerning petition EN1310 to the House of Representatives requesting a review of various aspects of the child support formula. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners may be interested in the following information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The child support scheme exists to assess and collect child support payments for the benefit of children of separated parents. The scheme and the legislation does not make any distinction based on the gender or background of either a paying parent or a receiving parent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government considers that the child support scheme appropriately balances the rights and needs of separated parents and their children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-weight:bold;" />
                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Self-Support Amount</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current child support formula was introduced in 2008 using extensive research undertaken by the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support on the costs of caring for children in Australia. The formula includes a self-support amount, which is currently $25,575 for child support periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. This amount is deducted from each parent's income before the calculation of child support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Taskforce recommended that each parent should have the same self-support amount deducted in recognition of their basic living expenses. The self-support amount is the same for both paying and receiving parents and is set at one third of the annualised Male Total Average Weekly Earnings figure to ensure it keeps pace with increases in the cost of living.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While this fixed amount is deducted from each parent's income to account for self-support expenses, parents are only required to pay a proportion of their income above this amount as child support. This means that parents with income above the self-support amount still have other income available at their disposal for self-support and other living expenses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Relevant dependent children</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where either parent has a new biological or adopted child, the child support formula recognises the costs associated with supporting the child by deducting a 'relevant dependent child amount' from their child support income. The Costs of the Children Table used in child support assessments is also used to determine the costs of any relevant dependent children. This ensures children of first and subsequent families are treated in similar ways.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When calculating the costs of a child of the assessment, both parent's incomes are combined to determine the financial resources available. It is important to note, however, that when calculating the cost of a relevant dependent child, only the income of the assessed child support parent is used. Therefore, while it can appear in an assessment that a relevant dependent child costs less than the children of the assessment, this amount represents only the child support parent's share of the costs of that child, and not that of their new partner.</span>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Although the Government cannot force parents to make certain decisions about their lifestyle or employment, if either parent believes their child support assessment is unfair because of the special circumstances of their case, they can seek a review under the change of assessment process. Under Reason 8 of the change of assessment process, Services Australia can change an assessment based on the earning capacity of either parent. However, where either parent has caring responsibilities for a new relevant dependent child, Services Australia would be unlikely to find that parent to have a greater capacity to earn income for a number of years after that child came into their care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In order to establish that a parent has a greater capacity to earn income, Services Australia must be satisfied the parent is not working despite ample opportunity to do so, and their decision is not justified by either their caring responsibilities or state of health. Services Australia must also consider whether the parent's earnings have been reduced due to an intention to vary the level of child support to their own advantage.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This test is framed as a 'rebuttable presumption'. The starting point is that affecting the child support assessment is presumed to be a major purpose of the parent's decision about their working arrangements. The parent can rebut this presumption by demonstrating that affecting the child support assessment was not a major purpose of their decision.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Therefore, if a parent ceases work in the circumstances described by the petitioners, Services Australia is unlikely to make an earning capacity determination against them. The petitioners can find more information about earning capacity under topic 2.6.14 of the Child Support Guide at www.guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide.</span>

              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Child support assessments are generally based on both parents' adjusted taxable income from the last relevant financial year and the level of care they provide for their children. Where a parent's income has reduced by 15 per cent or more from the income used in the assessment, parents can elect to have their child support assessment based on an estimate of their current income. Parents can update their estimate as often as every two weeks by contacting Services Australia on 13 1272 and there is no restriction on the number of times a parent can update their estimate during an assessment period.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that after an estimate period ends, Services Australia will reconcile the estimated income by comparing it with the parent's actual income for the estimate period. Estimates are reconciled when the parent's relevant adjusted taxable income becomes available from the Australian Taxation Office. The estimate reconciliation process ensures child support assessments are based on the most accurate income information available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where a parent's taxable income is higher than the estimated amount, the child support is reassessed for the estimate period based on the parent's higher actual taxable income, which may result in a paying parent owing arrears or a receiving parent incurring an overpayment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These rules apply to both paying and receiving parents equally because it is the parent's responsibility to ensure their income estimate is kept up-to-date. This process also helps to prevent the other parent either incurring an overpayment or owing child support arrears through no fault of their own.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to helping families manage their responsibilities for their children following separation and will continue to monitor the effect of child support legislation.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter regarding Petition E1349 urging the Australian Government to schedule a 'flight for evacuating Australian citizens and permanent residents (PRs) who remain trapped in Hubei'. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 represents the largest and most complex consular challenge in our history. As part of the Australian Government's early response, 846 people were assisted to depart Wuhan on two Qantas flights and one Air New Zealand flight in February. Seats on these flights were allocated to the most vulnerable and isolated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since this time, commercial flight options have resumed but are still subject to incoming passenger caps at major Australian airports. In June, China's Civil Aviation Authority announced the resumption of commercial flights between Wuhan, Hubei Province, and other locations in China, from which international air services are available for those seeking to return to Australia. Australians requiring consular assistance can contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade' s (DFAT's) consular emergency hotline on 1300 555 153 from Australia or +61 6261 3305 from overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More broadly, following the declaration of the global pandemic, more than 377,000 Australian citizens and PRs have returned to Australia from around the world. Of these, DFAT has, through its global diplomatic network, assisted over 27,100 Australians to return. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 13 May 2020 about Petition EN1382 and the delivery of income support payments onto the Cashless Debit Card (CDC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to supporting people, families and communities in places where high levels of welfare dependence co-exist with high levels of social harm. The CDC assists participants as a helpful budgeting and financial management tool to provide them with assistance to budget better for their circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CDC does not reduce the welfare payment amount people receive, it only changes the way in which participants receive and spend their fortnightly payments. Under the CDC, 80 per cent of a participant's welfare payment is placed on a card that can be used at most shops which accept Visa or eftpos, including overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CDC only applies to eligible income support payment recipients in the Ceduna region in South Australia, the East Kimberley and Goldfields regions in Western Australia and the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region in Queensland. All eligible income support payment recipients in these regions are placed onto the CDC. However, participants are able to apply to be exited from the CDC if they can demonstrate reasonable and responsible management of their affairs, including financial affairs. Other income support payment recipients can volunteer to be placed onto the CDC in the Ceduna, East Kimberley and Goldfields regions.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 15 June 2020 to the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, regarding petition number EN1524, calling for the House of Representatives to conduct a Royal Commission to assure the public that Australian politicians are against corruption. The Prime Minister has asked me to respond on his behalf. I apologise for the delay in responding to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that this petition is directed to the House of Representatives, rather than the Government. Having said that, the Australian Government condemns corruption in all its forms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the Commonwealth level, we have a multi-agency approach to combating corruption, under which a range of government institutions have specialised roles and responsibilities in deterring, detecting and responding to corruption. These institutions include independent statutory authorities and law enforcement agencies, which have the power to detect, investigate, and, where appropriate, prosecute those involved in corrupt activity. Parliamentary committees also have an oversight mechanism to hold the Government and public institutions to account. These arrangements have proven successful in that the Australian public sector is consistently ranked as a low corruption jurisdiction and it is generally accepted that there is no evidence of systemic or endemic integrity issues in the federal public sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is firmly committed to ensuring our federal integrity framework is as robust as possible to maximise public confidence in our national institutions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">That is why the Government has announced the establishment of a Commonwealth Integrity Commission (CIC) to enhance national integrity arrangements across the federal public sector. The CIC will be an independent statutory agency, led by a commissioner and two deputy commissioners. It will include a public sector integrity division and law enforcement integrity division, ensuring targeted attention to corruption and fraud across the entirety of the public sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on the proposed CIC is available at the following address:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the CIC, the Government will target serious criminal corruption that presents a threat to good public administration. The CIC will not duplicate the roles of existing bodies, but instead will provide expert capability to investigate allegations of serious criminal corruption within the public sector. Existing integrity agencies will be able to refer matters to the CIC, and vice versa.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has been consulting widely to ensure that the model for the new Commission strengthens federal integrity arrangements without compromising fundamental principles of our criminal justice system. To this end, the Government will release draft legislation to establish the CIC for public consultation at an appropriate time, when it has addressed more immediate priorities concerning the management of COVID-19. The petitioners may wish to consider the draft legislation and provide comments once it is released for public consultation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to the attention of the Prime Minister. A copy of this letter has been provided to the Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon Christian Porter MP, as matters relating to corruption in the federal public sector fall within his portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 August 2020, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN1603, which seeks an inquiry into, and increased regulation of, online travel agents (OTAs). Your correspondence has been referred to me and I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that OTAs have a significant impact on accommodation providers across Australia. While OTAs are popular with consumers because of the convenience they provide when searching for and booking accommodation, the Government considers it vital that OTAs comply with Australia's strong competition and consumer laws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has been active in enforcing these laws against OTAs. On 4 November 2020, the Full Federal Court rejected Trivago's appeal against an earlier ruling that it had made misleading representations about hotel room rates in its advertising. The Federal Court will now determine the level of penalties to apply: www.accc.gov.au/media-release/trivago-loses­appeal-after-misleading-consumers-over-hotel-ads. This case puts OTAs on notice that they must not advertise to consumers that they are offering the best deal available if that is not the case. This should encourage consumers to 'shop around' for the actual best room price available, which may well be directly from the hotel itself.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ACCC has also investigated so-called 'price-parity' clauses imposed by OTAs. Before September 2016, OTAs contractually prevented accommodation owners from offering better rates to other OTAs or to consumers on owner websites. On 2 September 2016, the ACCC announced that Expedia and Booking.com had agreed to cease this practice: www.accc.gov.au/media-release/expedia-and-bookingcom-agree-to­reinvigorate-price-competition-by-amending-contracts-with-australian-hotels. Following this, OTAs contractually prevented accommodation owners from offering consumers better rates on their own websites than they offered OTAs, although owners could offer better rates to consumers who contact them directly. In 2019, Expedia voluntarily ceased this practice.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you and the Committee for referring the petition of 24 August 2020 requesting the House not to consider the compensation claims for loss of income from the export of live cattle from 2011 (Petition number: EN1617). I understand that this petition relates to the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic;">Brett Cattle Company Pty Ltd v Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Forestry &amp; Anor,</span> (Brett Cattle).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has carefully considered the judgment in Brett Cattle and its implications. The government accepts the outcome of this decision and has decided not to appeal. The government does not wish to jeopardise the outcome for live cattle exporters who were affected by the suspension in 2011, which resulted in significant impacts on the cattle industry.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government remains committed to the benefits that the live export industry delivers to the national economy, to local communities and to families at the farmgate. The decision not to appeal the Federal Court's decision reaffirms that commitment. The government is also committed to ensuring that the welfare of exported livestock is managed and will continue to implement measures to achieve these objectives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a number of issues remain before the Federal Court, it is not appropriate to comment further.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter. </span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition Ministerial Referral (EN1648) - HomeBuilder eligibility. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">HomeBuilder forms part of a range of Australian Government initiatives intended to support confidence in the residential construction sector and encourage consumers to proceed with purchases or renovations that may have been delayed due to uncertainty around the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">HomeBuilder provides eligible owner-occupiers (including first home buyers) with a tax-free grant to build a new home or substantially renovate an existing home where the contract is signed between 4 June 2020 and 31 March 2021, noting that construction must commence within six months of the contract date and no earlier than 4 June 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government made a decision that the HomeBuilder program is only open to Australian citizens. For context, eligibility criteria for HomeBuilder was designed to align with the Government' s First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, under which permanent residents are not eligible.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Advice on what is considered a couple can be found on the website of your relevant state or territory authority. Generally, and as implemented under the Commonwealth's First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, this would include couples that are legally married, in a registered domestic relationship or those living as a couple on a genuine domestic basis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Applicants must be listed on the certificate of title for the property. If more than one person is listed on the certificate of title they must jointly apply for the HomeBuilder grant as a couple, and both applicants must meet the eligibility criteria of the program. That is, both individuals in the couple must be Australian Citizens.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst eligibility criteria around being an Australian citizen remains unchanged, I note that on 29 November 2020 the Government announced that the HomeBuilder program will be extended (to 31 March 2021).</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Regulation of cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets in Australia depends upon the form of the product and its rights. If the product is financial in nature, such as a security, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has jurisdiction under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Corporations Act 2001</span>, and a range of disclosure requirements and consumer protection provisions apply. ASIC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Moneysmart</span> website provides information for consumers on these products: www.moneysmart.gov.au/ investment-warnings/cryptocurrencies-and-icos and there are mechanisms in place to report misconduct.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">If the product is a non-financial good or service, Australian Consumer Law applies, which also has provisions in place for consumer protection. As with other types of property, fraud and theft is subject to police jurisdiction.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 19 October 2020 regarding petition EN1678 and the provision of funding to schools.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government strongly supports the right of parents to choose the best school for their child and provides funding for each child, regardless of the school system their parents choose. There has been longstanding bipartisan support by Australian governments, including both Commonwealth, state and territory, to contribute funding for every student, irrespective of the school they attend. Where parents choose non-government schools, taxpayer funding is discounted by the school community's capacity to contribute.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has historically been the majority public funder for non-government schools, while state and territory governments are majority public funders of the government sector. It is important to note that, although the Government provides substantial funding for schools in Australia, it does not have a direct role in the administration or operation of schools.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All approved authorities in receipt of Commonwealth funding for schools must meet the requirements of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Education Act 2013</span> (the Act), including not operating for profit, being fit and proper and being financially viable. These requirements apply to all schools, regardless of their educational philosophy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the Commonwealth's role in assuring quality of education, under the Act, approved authorities are required to implement a curriculum. This can be either the Australian Curriculum or another curriculum assessed by the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) as allowing comparable outcomes to the Australian Curriculum and included in ACARA's Recognition Register.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The nationally agreed Foundation to Year 10 Australian Curriculum (the curriculum) sets the expectations for what all Australian students should be taught, regardless of where they live or their background. The curriculum includes eight learning areas, seven general capabilities and three cross-curriculum priorities. This three-dimensional approach to the curriculum provides many opportunities for students to learn about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their history and culture.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories and Cultures cross-curriculum priority, which can be taught in any learning area where relevant, provides opportunities for all students to deepen their knowledge of Australia and addresses two distinct needs in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students can see themselves, their identities and their cultures reflected in the curriculum of each of the learning areas, can fully participate in the curriculum and can build their self-esteem</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">that all students engage in reconciliation, respect and recognition of the world' s oldest continuous living cultures.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, within the eight learning areas of the curriculum there are a number of examples where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and culture feature. For example, in the humanities and social sciences learning area, the diverse cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are explored through their long and continuous strong connections with country and place, and their economic, cultural, spiritual and aesthetic value of place, including the idea of custodial responsibility.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020 originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN1681 on JobKeeper Payment eligibility for casual employees of universities. Your correspondence has been referred to me by the Treasurer for response.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All Australian public universities are eligible for the JobKeeper Payment if they meet the eligibility criteria including the relevant decline in turnover test.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To qualify for the JobKeeper Payment during the extension from 28 September 2020 to 28 March 2021, Table A universities who have not participated in the original JobKeeper Payment (before 27 September 2020) need to meet the original decline in turnover test by comparing their turnover for January to June 2020 with turnover for the same six month period in 2019 in addition to the new decline in turnover test for the extension period. The six month turnover test period addresses the timing of income for universities, which is focused around the start of academic terms. The clarification was required as the monthly or quarterly turnover decline test was potentially subject to larger variations due to timing issues than underlying economic drivers would suggest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Universities also receive assistance from the Australian Government through the Higher Education Relief Package announced on 12 April 2020, which has provided $18 billion this year to Australia's public universities. The Higher Education Relief Package supports universities and eligible higher education providers to continue teaching by guaranteeing funding for universities at current levels, and providing greater flexibility in the use of these funds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The JobKeeper Payment continues to be targeted towards retaining links between employers and employees including for longer term casuals and permanent employees. Short term casuals may be eligible for the JobSeeker Payment if they are unable to find alternative work.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Subsection 12(3) of <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence Regulation 2016</span> requires that, before a person is appointed or enlisted to the Australian Defence Force, consideration must be given to whether they are a fit and proper person.

              <span class="HPS-Small">A prescribed level of medical and physical fitness is an inherent requirement for entry to and retention in the Australian Defence Force as all members may be called upon to perform operational service, potentially at short notice. To be able to fulfil their duties, Defence members are required to undertake, to varying degrees, arduous training during initial entry courses and on an ongoing basis throughout their career. Those who cannot meet medical and fitness standards may not be able to perform their duties safely in a deployed or operational setting, placing themselves and others at risk, such that the operation or mission may be compromised. Accordingly, the medical and fitness requirements for Australian Defence Force applicants are necessarily more stringent than for most other forms of employment.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020 originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition Ministerial Referral (EN1722) increasing income tax for high income individuals. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In regards to the proposal to impose increased personal income tax on individuals earning over $280,000, the Australian Government is committed to keeping the tax burden on Australians as low as possible. That said, Australians expect the tax system to be fair.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a progressive tax system. A progressive personal income tax system means those with the greatest ability to pay contribute a larger share of personal income tax revenue. When the Government's Personal Income Tax Plan is fully implemented in 2024-25, an individual with taxable income of $200,000, who earns 4.4 times more income than an individual with taxable income of $45,000, will pay around 10 times more tax. The top 5 per cent of income earners paid around one third of all personal income tax in 2017-18 and will do so in 2024-25 under the Governments legislated plan. This is fair and it helps to deliver the services and the support that Australians rely on.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is also important to recognise that Australia currently has relatively high rates of tax, cutting in at relatively low levels of income compared with other countries. Australia's top marginal tax rate cuts in at around 2.2 times average full-time earnings, compared with four times in Canada and the United Kingdom and eight times in the United States. Without the Government's legislated plan Australia's ratio is expected to drop further to around 1.7, reducing our international competiveness and ability to attract and retain talent. Increasing the threshold of the top tax bracket from $180,000 to $200,000 as legislated means that this ratio is now expected to fall more modestly to around 1.9.</span>
            </p>

Further, applicants who are not present in Australia at the time a decision is ready to be made on their application will not be refused under subsection 24(5) of the Act, without the delegate first reassessing the applicant's intention to reside in, or maintain a close and continuing association with, Australia. In making this assessment, the special circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would be taken into consideration.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 19 October 2020 regarding Petition EN1737. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia must play its part in the global response to climate change and we are doing our bit. Australia's emissions were coming down before the pandemic and are continuing to fall. In fact:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia's emissions are lower than when the Coalition came to Government in 2013.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia's emissions are now almost 17 per cent below 2005 levels (the year from which our 2030 Paris target is measured). This compares favourably with other countries like Canada and New Zealand, whose emissions declined less than 1 per cent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia's emissions are now at their lowest level since 1998.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's Technology Investment Roadmap will accelerate the development of new and emerging technologies that will create jobs, lower energy prices and reduce emissions. The Roadmap will guide the deployment of an expected $18 billion of Government investment over the next 10 years. Together with other levels of government, research institutions and the private sector, the Government is aiming to leverage at least $70 billion of new investment by 2030.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This investment will create over 130,000 jobs by 2030, more than half of these in regional areas. Getting these technologies right will significantly reduce emissions from sectors like energy, transport, industry and agriculture. These sectors account for around 90 per cent of global emissions and emit 45 billion tonnes each year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Looking forward, Australia's 2030 target is for a 26-28 per cent reduction on 2005 levels. On a per person basis, our target is more ambitious than the European Union, Germany, Canada, New Zealand or Japan have committed to over the same period. Our 2030 target is a floor on our ambition, not a cap.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package maps out how we will meet our 2030 target down to the last tonne. The latest official projections show that we are on track to meet and beat our 2030 target.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 17 September 2020, the Government announced a Future Fuels Package to help Australians choose new vehicle technologies. The centrepiece of the Future Fuels Package is a $71.9 million co-investment fund to enable businesses to start integrating new vehicle technologies into their fleets, and address blackspots in public charging infrastructure. These investments are central to the Government's Future Fuels Strategy that will support Australian households and businesses to adopt new technologies where it makes sense for them to do so, including hybrids, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and electric vehicles.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a world leader in renewable energy. We have invested more than $30 billion in renewable energy since 2017. In 2019, Australia deployed new renewable energy 10 times faster per person than the global average and four times faster than Europe, China, Japan or the US. About two million - one in four - Australian households now have solar panels on their roof. Last year, the share of wind and solar in Australia's electricity grids was more than double the global average and projected to rise rapidly in coming years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2019, Energy Ministers (formerly COAG Energy Council) agreed to the Trajectory for Low Energy Buildings, a national plan that aims to achieve zero energy and carbon-ready commercial and residential buildings in Australia. It's a key initiative to address Australia's 40 per cent energy productivity improvement target by 2030 under the National Energy Productivity Plan. The aim of the policies is to lower energy bills, contribute to energy security and affordability, and reduce carbon emissions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">One of the great challenges in the climate and emissions debate is recognising that we can only solve this problem together. At 1.3 per cent of emissions, Australia has almost no impact even if it eliminates all emissions. Other countries, particularly in the developing world, are reluctant to commit to policies and targets with material economic costs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia can play a leading role on the international stage by partnering with other nations to accelerate technologies. Real global action through technology, not taxes, is the pathway to realising strong economic and emissions outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing this petition to my attention. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning the petition EN1747 on the procurement of potential COVID-19 vaccines. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is taking a strong and decisive approach in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Government is committed to providing all Australians with access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they become available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 5 November 2020, the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, and myself announced two new advance purchase agreements between the Government and Novavax, and the Government and Pfizer/BioNTech for the supply of promising COVID-19 vaccines. The Government has secured 50 million doses of these vaccines, taking our total number of accessible doses to over 134 million if they are proven safe and effective. To date, the Government has invested more than $3.3 billion across five separate agreements with local and international pharmaceutical companies, including the previously announced agreements with the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca, the University of Queensland/CSL, and joining the COVAX Facility. Access to these vaccines is subject to acceptable clinical trial outcomes on the safety and effectiveness of each candidate, and approval by Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before any COVID-19 vaccine is approved for use in Australia it will be subject to the Therapeutic Goods Administration's (TGA) stringent assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials on tens of thousands of people. The TGA rigorously assesses all vaccines for safety, quality and effectiveness. Clinical trial evidence, as well as non-clinical data, is assessed by technical experts. After product registration, the TGA has an important role in batch release assessment and post-market surveillance to ensure the ongoing safety of the vaccine. Vaccines continue to be tested after their approval via additional clinical trials, surveillance and monitoring for adverse events. Further information on vaccine registration and safety monitoring is available via the TGA website at: www.tga.gov.au/vaccines-overview.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In June 2020, my Department established the COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy Taskforce (Taskforce). The Taskforce is an interagency arrangement hosted by my Department, with representation from the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Taskforce works closely with several panels of medical experts and staff from other key areas of the Department to develop advice to support access to, and delivery of, safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and treatments in Australia, as soon as they are available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Taskforce supports the COVID-19 Vaccines and Treatments for Australia - Science and Industry Technical Advisory Group (Advisory Group) who provide advice to Government on the purchasing and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. The Advisory Group, chaired by Dr Brendan Murphy, provides advice on the safety and effectiveness of potential COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments, purchasing and manufacturing opportunities for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments in Australia, distribution and logistics associated with potential COVID-19 vaccines, and other technical matters related to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition Ministerial Referral (EN1749) on consumer purchases. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), goods purchased by consumers are covered by statutory consumer guarantees. Consumer guarantees exist to ensure that consumers get what they pay for. Further information about the ACL and consumer guarantees is available from www.consumerlaw.gov.au. The guarantees include that goods:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">are of acceptable quality—that is, goods need to reach a basic level of quality given the price of the goods and any description that is provided with the goods;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">are fit for the purpose that the consumer described to the trader or that are self-evident;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">match any description or sample given to the consumer whether in promotional material, over the phone, in person, on a website or on labelling or packaging; and are free from defects and faults.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Sellers are required to provide remedies to consumers where a product fails to meet a consumer guarantee under the ACL. Remedies include repairs, replacement goods or refunds. For minor issues with goods, the supplier can choose the remedy, but must provide it within a reasonable time. If the supplier doesn't comply within a reasonable time, the consumer can have the failure remedied by someone else and recover reasonable costs from the supplier by taking action to enforce their rights. Where the failure cannot be remedied or is a 'major' failure, a consumer may reject the goods and require a refund or replacement good.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When a consumer obtains a remedy from a supplier for a consumer guarantee failure, they should not be charged a fee for enforcing their rights. If a supplier requests such a fee, this may amount to misleading and deceptive conduct or a false or misleading representation, which would breach the ACL.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are number of avenues for consumers who need assistance resolving issues relating to consumer guarantee failures. In some cases, local state and territory consumer protection agencies can provide consumers with information regarding their rights and options. They may also be able to help negotiate a resolution between the consumer and retailer. A list of state and territory agencies can be found at: www.accc.gov.au/contact-us/other-helpful-agencies/consumer-protection-agencies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, consumers are able to contact the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) for information about their consumer rights and obligations, and possible courses of action they might take. While the ACCC does not resolve individual complaints, they will use the information provided to help understand what issues are causing the most harm to Australian consumers, and where to focus their compliance and enforcement efforts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19: Hydroxychloroquine</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning a petition requesting the removal of restrictions for prescribing hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (Zithromax) (Petition Number EN1753). I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The circumstances under which medicines can be accessed by the Australian public are determined through a classification process known as 'scheduling'. Medicines and chemicals are classified into schedules, which are published in the Poisons Standard. Classification is based on the risk of harm and the level of access control required to protect public health and safety. The scheduling process is managed by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which is part of my Department. Scheduling decisions are made by a senior medical officer at the TOA, acting as a delegate of the Secretary of my Department. These are not decisions of the Minister for Health or the Australian Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been assessed as prescription only medicines because they are used for conditions that require the diagnosis and intervention from a medical practitioner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Azithromycin is approved to treat infections in different parts of the body caused by bacteria, such as chlamydia. No restrictions have been placed on the prescribing of azithromycin due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Hydroxychloroquine is approved to treat malaria and certain autoimmune conditions, including lupus. It is important to be aware that hydroxychloroquine can have serious side effects, including cardiac toxicity (potentially leading to sudden heart attacks), irreversible eye damage and severe depletion of blood sugar (potentially leading to coma).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">After COVID-19 emerged there was a sudden increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine in the community which resulted in some patients not being able to fill their regular prescriptions. As such, prescribing restrictions were introduced to ensure an ongoing supply of hydroxychloroquine to patients who need it to treat the conditions for which the product was approved. More information is available at: www.tga.gov.au/alert/new-restrictions­prescribing-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce is closely monitoring clinical studies in Australia and around the world that are investigating the use of potential COVID-19 treatments, including hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This taskforce comprises 29 peak health professional bodies whose members are providing clinical care to people with COVID-19. The taskforce undertakes continuous surveillance to identify and rapidly synthesise emerging research in order to provide national, evidence-based guidelines for the clinical care of people with COVID-19. You can view the taskforce guidelines at: www.covid19evidence.net.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Based on the current available evidence, my Department strongly discourages the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent COVID-19, unless the patient is enrolled in a clinical trial, which will have safety monitoring protocols and oversight by a Human Research Ethics Committee. Information on clinical trials for hydroxychloroquine being undertaken in Australia can be found on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trails Registry at: www.anzctr.org.au/TrialSearch.aspx using the search term 'hydroxychloroquine'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Similar to my Department and TGA's current position on the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19, the United States Food and Drug Administration has cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine outside of hospital or clinical trial settings, due to the risk of adverse effects. The United Kingdom medicines regulator has suspended recruitment to all studies of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA continues to publish updated information on hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 on their website at: www.tga.gov.au/alert/amendments-new-restrictions-prescribing­hydroxychloroguine-covid-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020 enclosing Petition EN1765 concerning legislative changes to enable expired Bridging B (Class WB) visa (BVB) holders to return to Australia. The Acting Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Alan Tudge MP, has asked that I respond on his behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In response to the scale of challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian Government closed its borders to all non-citizens and non-residents on 20 March 2020 in order to protect the health and livelihoods of those in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Regulations 1994</span> require applicants for a BVB to be in Australia to be granted a BVB, individuals whose BVBs expired before they could return to Australia will need to obtain a different visa to return to Australia. There is currently no ability to extend or reinstate the validity of the BVB.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Exemptions to return to Australia are available for those with genuine compassionate and compelling reasons. The Commissioner of the Australian Border Force, Mr Michael Outram APM, and authorised decision-makers are responsible for considering these exemptions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Individuals with the appropriate evidence to support their claims can apply for an exemption on the Department's website at: https://travel-exemptions.homeaffairs.gov.au/tep.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your Correspondence of 19 October 2020 concerning a petition requesting that Hydrene be made available in Australia for the treatment of Meniere's disease (Petition Number EN1771).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate that this medicine has been important in the treatment of Meniere's disease. I understand that it is very important for the health and wellbeing of those who signed the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The sponsor of this medicine, Alphapharm Pty Ltd, informed the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) on 21 May 2019 that the supply of Hydrene 25/50 tablet blister pack would be discontinued with a deletion from market date of 31 July 2019.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The decision to discontinue a medicine is made by the sponsor and can occur due to various reasons. The Australian Government does not have the regulatory power to require sponsors to register or supply their medicine in Australia, or manage their global distribution to avoid shortfalls in drug availability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Hydrene is the only combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide registered in Australia. There are no registered alternative products in Australia that contain triamterene alone. Hydrochlorothiazide, the other active ingredient in Hydrene, is available as a single ingredient product registered in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods legislation provides a number of avenues through which Australian residents and medical practitioners may access therapeutic goods that are not available in Australia, including the Special Access Scheme (SAS) and the Personal Importation scheme. I encourage those who have previously been prescribed Hydrene to speak to their treating doctor about the appropriateness of seeking access to treatments not included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The SAS refers to arrangements that allow for the import and/or supply of an unapproved therapeutic good for a single patient, on a case-by-case basis. To access unapproved medicines via the SAS, the prescribing doctor should submit an application to the TGA. The Personal Importation scheme allows individuals to legally import up to a three-month supply of certain therapeutic goods for personal use or the use of an immediate family member with a valid prescription from an Australian-registered medical practitioner.</span>

In recognition of this important role, charities receive significant support from the Australian Government, both directly and through tax concessions, and by donations from members of the general public.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is strongly committed to maintaining, protecting and enhancing the public trust and confidence in the sector that underpins this support. This is vital in ensuring the ongoing sustainability of the sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) was established for this purpose. It plays a key role in assisting charities to achieve their charitable purpose, and also in providing education to the public about the charity sector. This helps to improve public understanding of, and engagement with, the important work of the sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As referenced in the petition, the ACNC Commissioner maintains a Charity Register that contains information about Australia's registered charities. This information is free to search and is available to everyone. Each listing on the Register shows details about a charity and its purposes, the names of the people involved in running the charity, and financial information and annual reporting. By providing a single source of easily accessible public information, the Register increases transparency in the sector, enables charities to demonstrate appropriate levels of accountability and governance, promotes public confidence and informs donations and philanthropy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you may be aware, the Government recently released its response to Strengthening for Purpose: Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Legislation Review 2018 (the Review) - the inaugural review of the ACNC's governing legislation. The Government's response is centred on the importance of strengthening trust and confidence in the charities sector and agrees reforms to enhance transparency, clarify permissible advocacy and increase information sharing with the public.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through its response to the Review, the Government has agreed to require charities to make additional disclosures regarding related party transactions and remuneration paid to responsible persons. Requiring charities to be transparent about the finer details of their operations will increase their accountability to donors, beneficiaries and the general public. The Government is currently progressing work to implement these reforms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) is also making improvements to its accounting standards for Not-for-Profit Entities. This will help to improve the quality of reporting in the sector and provide additional transparency around the operation of individual charities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I also note that the charity sector has displayed strong aptitude for increasing the transparency of its own operation. Charities' experience in the Black Saturday bushfire crisis recovery effort has highlighted the importance of providing public information on how donations have been and will be used, and giving assurance that all funds are being used for their donated purpose. Charities involved in bushfire assistance have proactively published information on their websites indicating exactly where the funds will be used and what percentage will be used for administration costs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Temporary Graduate visa (TGV) is part of Australia's international education offering. The primary objective of the visa is to provide international students who have spent significant time studying here with the opportunity to work, study and stay for a further period. TGV holders are not required to undertake any particular activity if they do not wish to. It is important to note that the TGV is a temporary visa and does not provide a pathway to skilled migration.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current focus for the Australian Government is on protecting the health of Australians, supporting businesses and jobs, and maintaining the provision of essential goods and services while combatting the pandemic.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 13 November 2020, seeking my response to Petition EN1812 - Support for people with disability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is dedicated to improving outcomes for the 4.4 million Australians with disability across all areas of life. All levels of government (the Australian Government, state, territory and local governments), and all sectors of the community, share the responsibility to work together to remove barriers and shape attitudes so people with disability can fully participate as equal members of the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to strong action and is currently investing over $32 billion per year on programs and services to improve the lives of people with disability. This includes delivery of services through the National Disability Insurance Scheme to support around 500,000 Australians, giving them choice and control in their lives; ensuring economic inclusion and financial security for people with disability through provision of the Disability Support Pension; as well as helping people with disability prepare for, find and keep a job through the Disability Employment Service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">National Disability Strategy 2010-2020</span> (the Strategy) is Australia's overarching policy framework for disability reform, and the key mechanism for driving more inclusive policy and program design across all levels of government. The Strategy is Australia's main way of implementing our obligations under the United Nations <span style="font-style:italic;">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</span> and is a shared commitment by the Australian Government, state, territory and local governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Strategy focusses on six outcome areas to guide efforts of governments to improve the lives of people with disability:</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Inclusive and Accessible Communities - People with disability live in accessible and well-designed communities with opportunity for full inclusion in social, economic, sporting and cultural life.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Rights Protection, Justice and Legislation - People with disability have their rights promoted, upheld and protected.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Economic Security - People with disability, their families and carers have economic security, enabling them to plan for the future and exercise choice and control over their lives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Personal and Community Support - People with disability, their families and carers have access to a range of supports to assist them to live independently and actively engage in their communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Learning and Skills - People with disability achieve their full potential through their participation in an inclusive and high quality education system that is responsive to their needs. People with disability have opportunities to continue learning throughout their lives.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is leading work with states, territories and local government on the development of a new National Disability Strategy (the new Strategy) for beyond 2020. The development of the new Strategy is being informed by public engagement with people with disability, families, carers, advocacy organisations, peak bodies and service providers. You can find information on previous reviews of the Strategy and the public engagement process at www.engage.dss.gov.au/nds-stage2-consultation </span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is the most significant social reform of its kind since the introduction of Medicare. Since the NDIS was established in 2013, it has helped more than 400,000 people with permanent and significant disability - many who are receiving supports for the very first time - participate in their community, get a job if they are able to and have greater independence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is on track to deliver significant improvements to the NDIS that make it simpler, faster, fairer and more flexible for participants, and their families and carers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Significant improvements have already been made to reduce wait times and bring people with permanent and significant disability, particularly children, into the NDIS quicker so they can get the crucial supports they need. The Australian Government has also provided additional funding of over $3 billion for participant costs and invested a further $798.8 million to the National Disability Insurance Agency (NOIA) and the NDIS Quality &amp; Safeguards Commission over the forward estimates. This will support the NDIA's continued implementation of a mature and effective NDIS and continue to deliver significant improvements to the NDIS.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to a welfare system that supports the most vulnerable, encourages those who are able to work or study, and is sustainable for future generations. The income and assets tests are therefore an important feature of the social security system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Providing targeted assistance through the means test is consistent with the basic principle that individuals should be required to draw on their own resources before calling upon taxpayer funded support.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">To remove the means test for all recipients of Disability Support Pension would be costly and would impact on the government's ability to maintain an adequate rate of pension for those people in genuine need.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 October 2020 as part of the Federal Budget for 2020-21, the Government announced it will be offering refunds or waivers of visa application charges (VAC) for some temporary visa holders affected by COVID-19-related travel restrictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">VAC refunds will be available for Prospective Marriage visa holders who have been unable to enter Australia before their visa expired due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Refunds will ensure that visa holders are able to apply for another visa to travel to Australia as appropriate. For those visas that have already expired, any new application will be prioritised. Visa extensions will also be available for Prospective Marriage visa holders in certain circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020 enclosing Petition EN1834 concerning international students and travel exemptions. The Acting Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Alan Tudge MP, has asked that I respond on his behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government understands that travelling to Australia is a critical consideration for students whose studies have been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Prime Minister's, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, three-step Roadmap to a COVID-safe Australia makes clear that the Government supports the return of international students to Australia. Across government, careful consideration is being given to how and when this can occur in a COVID-safe way.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is working closely with the states and territories, in partnership with education institutions, on arrival pilots for international students to come to Australia in a managed setting. This will occur following the return of Australians and when other circumstances allow.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any student arrival plan will need to have robust health, quarantine, border and provider protocols in place to ensure a COVID-safe environment for both Australians and international students.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 November 2020 concerning the petition EN1839 seeking reform aligned with the Interim Report of the Independent Review of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</span> (EPBC Act).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 30 October 2020, the Independent Reviewer of the EPBC Act, Professor Graeme Samuel AC, provided me with his Final Report. The Final Report is comprehensive, and the Government is presently taking the time necessary to fully consider Professor Samuel's recommendations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The EPBC Act requires that the Final Report be laid before each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days after I receive it. The Government will publish and respond to the Final Report in due course.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government remains committed to the early reforms I announced in July 2020, which align with the direction of the EPBC Act review Interim Report. This includes progressing single-touch approvals, which will accredit states and territories to make EPBC Act approval decisions on the Commonwealth's behalf, underpinned by new national environmental standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Independent Reviewer undertook extensive engagement with a range of stakeholders to develop a set of recommended national environmental standards. These have been included in the Final Report. I am currently considering these, alongside the Reviewer's other recommendations, to determine their suitability to underpin single-touch approvals with the states and territories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. I trust this information will be of assistance in responding to the petitioners.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 November 2020 originally directed to the Treasurer, on Petition EN1840 concerning the JobKeeper Payment and ABN registration. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you would be aware, the JobKeeper Payment has played an important role as a temporary wage subsidy through these challenging times. The program requires both the employer and employee to meet the applicable eligibility criteria.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Employees are generally only eligible to receive the payment in relation to one employer. While the rules make provision in relation to businesses that change hands, these rules are limited to working out whether an employee was employed by the new business at a particular time. As a result, an employee's ongoing eligibility with a new business will ultimately depend on the way that a business changes hands.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, employer eligibility can also be impacted depending on how a business changes hands. One of the eligibility conditions for employers is holding an ABN on 12 March 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These eligibility conditions are important integrity features which ensure that the JobKeeper Payment applies to genuine businesses and preserves existing employment relationships.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, under the JobKeeper Rules, the Tax Commissioner does have some discretion to allow some entities, including sole traders, additional time to comply with certain conditions to be eligible for the JobKeeper Payment. In very limited circumstances, the Tax Commissioner has discretion to grant further time to hold an Australian Business Number (ABN) where an ABN was not held on 12 March 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to providing all Australians with access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines as soon as available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians should be assured that any potential COVID-19 vaccines will be subject to Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration's (TGA) rigorous regulatory requirements before it can be legally supplied in Australia, including strong scientific evidence from large clinical trials involving thousands of people. The TGA rigorously assesses all vaccines for safety, quality and effectiveness, including evaluation of clinical trial evidence and non-clinical data assessed by technical experts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has secured access to doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca, Novavax Inc and Pfizer/BioNTech. These vaccines are currently in Phase 3 clinical trials involving large-scale, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials with tens of thousands of participants, including groups that have high risk of severe health impacts associated with COVID-19, such as older adults and people who have underlying health conditions.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">After product registration, the TGA has an important role in batch release assessment and post-market surveillance to ensure the ongoing safety of the vaccine.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 November 2020 regarding petition number EN1867. The petition relates to provisions of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and their Families First) Act 2019</span> (the Act), current time taken to process claims by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) and resourcing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act includes a commitment by the Australian Government for the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission (MRCC) to decide a claim under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA) within 90 days from when the MRCC receives the claim or within 90 days of any requested information being provided.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the concerns of signatories to the petition regarding the complexity of claims and the time taken to process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">DVA is working to reduce claims processing times overall but in some cases, the Department is not able to meet expectations. Volumes in relation to the most common claims have doubled in the past two years (120,000 claims were received in 2019-20). Reasons for the increase relate to the success of the Veteran Centric Reform Program, veterans lodging claims closer to the time of injury and a better knowledge throughout the veteran community of entitlements. This scale of increase has, in some instances, led to an increase in the time taken to process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">DVA processes every claim individually, based on veteran circumstances and available evidence. To make a thorough evidence-based decision, the Department often requires information from third parties (e.g. treating doctors). The length of time taken to receive this information is often outside of DVA's control and can impact processing times.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 October 2020, the Australian Government announced an additional $23.2 million in funding for DVA to continue its focus on processing claims as quickly as possible, in particular Initial Liability claims. Additional funding provided earlier facilitated the engagement of additional processing staff resulting in a 57 per cent increase in the number of MRCA Permanent Impairment determinations between January and June 2020, compared to the same period in 2019.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of 2019-20, the number of 'on hand' MRCA Permanent Impairment claims was the lowest since June 2019, which in conjunction with an increased number of determinations, indicates MRCA Permanent Impairment processing is tracking well. DVA is working to address the current high volume of Initial Liability claims.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Extended processing times may have a detrimental impact on veteran health. That is why additional measures have been taken to ensure claims are triaged and veterans and their families can access support while claims are determined . These measures include:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">upfront access to mental health care and access to medical treatment for a range of common conditions;</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">interim financial support for mental health claims via the Veteran Payment;</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">interim payments for Permanent Impairment cases; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">further technological enhancements to make the claim process simpler and easier for veterans and their families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Claims are screened upon receipt by the Department. If a veteran is experiencing significant life events such as being homeless (or being at the risk of), a terminal illness, life threatening condition(s) and/or extended financial hardship, claims are prioritised. DVA also encourages anyone in these circumstances to contact them immediately to explore available support. Anyone who has concerns about the timeliness of their claim, or feels their circumstances warrant prioritisation, should call DVA on 1800 VETERAN (1800 838 372).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Free and confidential counselling and support to service and ex-service men and women, as well as their partners and children is also available from Open Arms - Veterans &amp; Families Counselling (Open Arms). Open·Arms can be contacted 24/7 on 1800 011 046. More information can also be found at www.openarms.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am confident the measures taken by the Australian Government to improve DVA claim processing timeframes coupled with substantial support arrangements to veterans and their families who may be experiencing delays and simplifying arrangements, is improving the overall claiming experience for the vast majority of veterans and their families.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 November 2020, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition Ministerial Referral Land Purchase (EN1868). Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government understands that if a family or an individual has a roof over their head, then all of life's other challenges become more manageable. Access to secure and affordable housing has significant economic and social benefits. It can improve education and health outcomes, increase workforce participation and reduce welfare dependency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While state and territory governments are primarily responsible for housing, the Government provides substantial support to help states and territories to fund important initiatives and improve housing outcomes. States and territories can improve land development laws through removing regulatory impediments imposed by state and local governments' planning, land use and housing infrastructure policies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government provides substantial support to states and territories so they can fund important initiatives to improve housing outcomes. 1n 2020-21, the Government expects to spend around $8.4 billion to support Australians in need of housing assistance, including around $7.5 billion in programs managed by the Social Services portfolio. This includes around $5.5 billion a year in Commonwealth Rent Assistance to help eligible Australians on welfare payments pay their rent and around $1.6 billion a year through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement to states. Through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement, $129.1 million is being set aside for homelessness services in 2020-21 and will have to be matched by states.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also creating the right incentives to improve housing outcomes by helping first home buyers save a deposit through voluntary contributions into superannuation and allowing eligible first home buyers to enter the housing market sooner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The First Home Loan Deposit Scheme commenced on l January 2020 and provides up to 10,000 guarantees per financial year to help Australians realise their goal of owning their own home, by enabling first home buyers to purchase a modest home sooner with a deposit of as little as 5 per cent. Australian first home buyers have now reserved all of First Home Loan Deposit Scheme guarantees for the 2019-20 financial year. From 1 July 2020, an additional 10,000 guarantees were made available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the 2020-21 Budget, the Government announced has extended the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme by introducing an additional 10,000 guarantees in 2020-21 (the New Home Guarantee), specifically for first home buyers seeking to build a new home or purchase a newly built dwelling. These changes will help to improve housing outcomes for all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Government's First Home Super Saver Scheme (FHSSS), individuals can make voluntary contributions of up to $15,000 per year and $30,000 in total, to their superannuation account to purchase a first home. These contributions, which are taxed at 15 per cent, along with deemed earnings, can be withdrawn for a deposit from 1 July 2018. For most people, the FHSSS could boost the savings they can put towards a deposit by at least 30 per cent compared with saving through a standard deposit account. This is due to the concessional tax treatment and the higher rate of earnings often realised within superannuation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 9 November 2020 regarding petition EN1879, requesting that the House of Representatives seek an order from the High Court to open state borders. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-weight:bold;" />
                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Freedom of movement</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A number of states and territories have taken measures under their own laws, including public health and emergency management legislation, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures include those referred to in the petition which limit movement across state borders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The imposition of some restrictions on interstate travel by governments for public health reasons is permissible under the Constitution, as indicated by the High Court's recent dismissal of Mr Clive Palmer's challenge to the Western Australian border restrictions. On 6 November 2020, the High Court made orders in <span style="font-style:italic;">Palmer v Western Australia</span>, dismissing Mr Palmer's constitutional challenge to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Quarantine (Closing the Border) Directions</span> (WA). The Court found that the enabling legislation, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Emergency Management Act 2005</span> (WA), did not impermissibly infringe section 92 of the Constitution. Section 92 provides for the freedom of interstate trade, commerce and movement. The Court will publish the reasons for its decision at a later date.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petitioners' concern about freedom of movement throughout the Commonwealth. Freedom of movement between the states, within reasonable bounds, is an important constitutional safeguard. However, the Government acknowledges community concern about the spread of COVID-19. The Government is seeking to work cooperatively with state and territory governments to ease domestic border restrictions where it is safe to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">

                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Judicial independence</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Chapter III of the Australian Constitution provides for the judicial branch of the Commonwealth. The High Court has made it clear that one consequence of Chapter III is that only a court may exercise federal judicial power. Another is that the power must be exercised independently of the other branches of the Commonwealth established under other chapters of the Constitution (the Commonwealth parliament is established under Chapter I of the Constitution and the Commonwealth executive government is established under Chapter II).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This strict separation of judicial power is often acknowledged as a very important element of the 'separation of powers' principle which underpins Australia's constitutional arrangements. In accordance with the separation of powers principle, federal courts exercise power independently of the Australian Government of the day.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is an essential feature of the Australian system of government that our courts are independent and free of interference from the executive arm of government. Judicial independence is provided under the Australian Constitution to ensure that disputes between people, and between people and governments, are resolved by judges who are impartial and are not subject to improper control or pressure, whether governmental or private. Public confidence in the administration of justice is vital to the maintenance of the rule of law which underpins our democratic system of government. Among the principles which ensure such public confidence is the principle of judicial independence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, under Chapter III of the Constitution, the High Court cannot give advisory opinions or make a declaration of the law divorced from any attempt to administer the law, but rather must only exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth in matters involving the determination of an immediate right, duty or liability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It would therefore be inappropriate for the House of Representatives to request the High Court of Australia to make the orders requested in the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter with me.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 9 November 2020 concerning petition EN1884 - Urgently Needed Changes to Public Health Policy Regarding Covid-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is taking a strong and decisive approach in responding to COVID-19. The relatively low number of COVID-19 cases in Australia is the result of the swift and successful implementation of public health measures. It is also evident that countries where public health measures were either not implemented at all, or were implemented later in the pandemic, have experienced very high case numbers and mortality, which is in stark contrast to Australia's current epidemiology.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Letting the virus transmit through the majority of the community has not been adopted for a number of reasons:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">herd immunity via large scale natural infection across the population is not guaranteed by adopting this approach</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the length of immunity after natural infection remains largely unknown and reinfection in healthy individuals with a subsequent and more serious bout of the disease cannot be ruled out at this time</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">although data indicate that increasing age and co-existence of chronic disease are the factors that place a person at higher risk of severe disease, there is no clear delineation between those who are vulnerable and those who are not</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">being young and healthy does not guarantee that you would have a full recovery if infected with SARS-CoV-2.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, we continue to pursue an 'aggressive suppression' approach with the goal of no local community transmission, at least until a vaccine or effective treatment is widely available. This has led to periods of elimination in parts of the country.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our national strategy balances the economic and social costs of suppression against the potential costs associated with widespread disease, such as the number of lives lost and an overwhelmed healthcare system. This has also bought Australia valuable time to enhance its hospital and public health capacity to manage the disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, there is no cure or treatment to prevent COVID-19, although a number of medications can help people who are very seriously ill. The Government is closely monitoring worldwide research of treatments for patients with COVID-19. Obtaining robust evidence in the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic is essential in ensuring public safety and we encourage administration and collection of data via clinical trials.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is currently no definitive clinical trial research evidence that Vitamin C and/or Zinc has a role in preventing or treating COVID-19. The use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and ivermectin (either alone or in combination with other medications) for the treatment of COVID-19 is not recommended outside of randomised trials. Although a medicine may be approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to treat a particular condition, it does not automatically mean that it is safe to treat another condition 'off-label'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 November 2020 regarding Petition EN1897, presented to the Standing Committee on Petitions, which raises privacy concerns about photos taken of individuals in public without their consent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government takes seriously the privacy of Australians. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Act 1988</span> (Privacy Act) sets outs rights and obligations in relation to the collection, use, disclosure and handling of personal information. These are contained in 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). Personal information is information or an opinion that identifies or could reasonably identify an individual. Personal information may include photographs of individuals. The Privacy Act generally applies to Commonwealth government agencies and any organisation with an annual turnover of more than $3 million, and some other organisations (APP entities). The Act does not, however, cover individuals acting in their own capacity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The APPs generally prevent APP entities from collecting personal information unless the information is reasonably necessary for an entity's functions or activities (APP 3). In addition, an entity must take reasonable steps to notify an individual of the collection of personal information (APP 5) and must not use or disclose such information for a purpose other than the primary purpose of collection, unless the individual to whom the personal information relates has consented or an exception applies (APP 6).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">An entity must also take reasonable steps to destroy information that is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected (APP 11). Individuals can also request access to personal information about them (APP 12) and have it corrected (APP 13).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) is responsible for investigating breaches of the Privacy Act. If there is a concern that an entity is breaching the APPs, a complaint could be made to the OAIC. Information on how to make a privacy complaint, as well further information on the Privacy Act, is available from the OAIC website at: www.oaic.gov.au. Information about social media and online privacy, including what to do if a photo (or video) is taken or posted online without permission can be found at: https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/social-media-and­online-privacy/photos.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has made firm commitments to further strengthen privacy protections, in line with community expectations. The Government is currently preparing legislation that will increase civil penalties for breaches of the Privacy Act and establish a privacy code for social media and other online platforms that trade in personal information. The code will require these companies to be more transparent about any data sharing and require more specific consent of users when they collect, use and disclose personal information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also commenced a broad-ranging review of the Privacy Act. The review is considering whether the Act effectively protects personal information and provides a practical and proportionate framework for promoting good privacy practices, including in relation to the erasure of personal information and notification and consent requirements. This includes consideration of the need for additional privacy protections in relation to children. Further information about the review is available at: https://www.ag.gov.au/integrity/consultations/.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the concerns raised in Petition EN1897 to my attention. I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 November 2020, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN1918 which requests the exclusion of the logo of the Dutch East India Company from Australian legal tender coins. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The coin referred to in the petition (the Zuytdorp coin) is part of a series of four investment (or bullion) coins depicting historically-significant events in Australian waters, namely shipwrecks which are protected under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976</span> (Cth). Timbers and artefacts recovered from the four shipwrecks featured in the coin series are housed at the Western Australian Shipwrecks Museum in Perth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Royal Australian Mint has advised that the ornamental elements employed on the Zuytdorp coin design, including the Dutch East India Company logo, resemble the ornaments believed to be on the ship's stern. The use of the logo identifies the ship and provides historical context, ensuring the events featured on the coins are reflected authentically. It does not promote or indicate support for the company or its actions.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence concerning EN1939 - Petition to introduce legislation to unconditionally indemnify all Australians against all out-of-pocket expenses upon receiving notice of a vaccine injury claim and commensurably compensate Australians in the case of a successful vaccine injury claim. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to providing all Australians with access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they become available. This commitment forms a crucial part of the Government's response to COVID-19 and its strategy to protect the health and wellbeing of Australians and the Australian economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On Monday 7 September 2020 the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, announced production and supply agreements for the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca and University of Queensland/CSL COVID-19 vaccine, if the vaccines are proven to be safe and effective and can be registered for use in Australia. On 5 November 2020, the .Prime Minister and I further announced two more COVID-19 agreements for the supply of promising COVID-19 vaccines, between the Government and Novavax Inc and Pfizer/BioNTech. Through these agreements, the Government has now secured access to four COVID-19 vaccines and over 134 million doses. Should these vaccines prove to be safe and effective and can be registered for use in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Once registered, a COVID-19 vaccine will continue to be closely examined after introduction via ongoing surveillance and monitoring for adverse events.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has acknowledged the need to appropriately share risks associated with achieving early access to a successful vaccine, and has actively engaged with potential COVID-19 vaccine suppliers on this issue. Details of agreements with companies in relation to the potential supply of a COVID-19 vaccine, including liability indemnification, are commercial-in-confidence. However, any contractual agreements with individual companies cannot stop individuals seeking to make a claim, should an individual seek to do this in the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is not pursuing a no-fault COVID-19 vaccine injury compensation scheme at this time. While the Government strongly supports immunisation, it is not compulsory and people, parents and carers maintain the right to choose whether to receive a vaccination or vaccinate their children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 9 November 2020 regarding Petition EN1940 presented to the House of Representatives on power prices, renewable energy and climate change. I appreciate the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My priority as Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction is bringing power prices down and keeping the lights on, while meeting Australia's emissions reduction commitments. That's why the Liberal National Government is working to implement our plan for a Fair Deal on Energy that we took to the last election. We are already seeing results.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government established the Underwriting New Generation Investments (UNGI) program to support firm generation capacity as part of our government's commitment to lowering electricity prices and increasing reliability in the system. The program is technology neutral, providing a level playing field to enable the best and lowest cost generation options to be supported. The Government agreed to a shortlist of 12 projects representing a range of fuel types, including six renewable pumped hydro projects, five gas projects and one coal upgrade project.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there is more to do, I am pleased that Australian retail power prices have dropped by 5.3 per cent since December 2018 and wholesale prices have fallen for 14 consecutive months.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not provide direct funding support through the Renewable Energy Target (RET). The RET is a legislated, market-based mechanism that provides a financial incentive for the deployment of renewable energy projects. The RET operates through the creation of renewable energy certificates, which can be traded with 'liable entities' (primarily electricity retailers) that surrender the certificates to meet their annual renewable energy obligations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Support for renewable energy provided through the RET is declining. The legislated Large­scale RET peaks in 2020, and with the target expected to be exceeded, the level of support provided under the scheme will decline significantly over the coming years. The level of support per installation provided under the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme is also legislated to decline each year until the RET ends in 2030.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's approach is to deliver a secure and affordable energy system as it transitions to a lower emissions future. Technology, not taxes, will be the way we deliver practical action on emissions reduction. We will work together with industry and researchers to deploy the right technology when and where it is needed for cheaper bills and lower emissions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia must play its part in the global response to climate change and we are doing our bit. While it is not widely replied, Australia's emissions are coming down. In fact:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia's emissions are lower now than when the Coalition came to Government in 2013.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Australia's emissions are more than 13 per cent below 2005 levels (the year from which our 2030 Paris target is measured). This compares to flatlining emissions in Canada and less than a one per cent decrease for New Zealand.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia can play a leading role on the international stage by partnering with other nations to accelerate technologies. Real global action through technology, not taxes, is the pathway to realising strong economic and emissions outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We see enormous potential in technologies like hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, soil carbon sequestration and biofuels to reduce emissions in Australia and globally - all while strengthening our economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All of this is focussed on meeting and beating our commitments while maintaining a strong economy.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 30 November 2020 regarding Petition EN1950, which seeks freedom of information (FOI) reforms. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to the effective operation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Information Act 1982</span> (FOI Act) and ensuring it continues to meet the objectives of:</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The FOI Act gives everyone a legally enforceable right to obtain information from most Australian Government ministers and agencies, whether it is information about themselves or information about government policy or operational matters. The FOI Act recognises that this right must be balanced against the need to protect sensitive and confidential information, and provides exemptions for national security and intelligence agencies, as well as for the protection of essential public interests and the privacy of individual persons. Even if exemptions do apply, agencies must generally accept and process an FOI application, assess whether an exemption limiting disclosure applies, and provide reasons to the applicant for refusing disclosure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To assist the public, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) provides information on their website regarding FOI rights, how to make an FOI request, how to access different types of information, and how to lodge a review or complaint. The OAIC also publishes guidelines about the operation of the FOI Act, which agencies and ministers must have regard to when performing a function or exercising a power under the FOI Act.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The FOI Act closely regulates the way that agencies and ministers must process requests for access to documents, and specifies agencies and ministers have 30 days within which to make a decision, with limited extension of time provisions available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The FOI Act also requires all regulated agencies provide quarterly and annual statistical returns in relation to FOI matters to the OAIC for inclusion in the OAIC's Annual Report.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The FOI Act applies only to Australian Government ministers and most agencies. Each Australian State and Territory is responsible for their own legislation that is equivalent to the FOI Act that covers their public sectors. Requests for action regarding State and Territory legislation should be directed to the State and Territories.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 30 November 2020, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN1987 and the petitioners' request to cease tobacco excise increases. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government discourages the use of all tobacco products as there is no form of tobacco use which has benign health effects for consumers. Despite the recent decline in the incidence of smoking, it remains a leading cause of preventable death and disability in Australia, with smoking estimated to have killed almost 21,000 Australians in 2015.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The World Health Organisation identifies price increases through taxation as one of the most effective ways governments can reduce tobacco consumption. Successive governments have made significant efforts in recent years to reduce tobacco consumption through staged increases in tobacco excise and a swap to wage indexation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Tobacco rates are indexed biannually to an index of average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) on 1 March and 1 September every year. In addition to this, in the 2016-17 Budget the Government announced four annual 12.5 per cent rate increases occurring on 1 September every year from 2017 to 2020 inclusive. This continued a series of annual 12.5 per cent increases since December 2013. No further tobacco excise increases were announced in the 2020-21 Budget.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The taxation of tobacco products, apart from discouraging smoking, helps to pay for support for people who wish to quit smoking, essential services such as the delivery of health services and other areas of spending that benefit the whole Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 9 November 2020, on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning Petition EN2003 - Investigate the effects of social media phenomena.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government is committed to keeping Australians, and particularly children, safe online. Australia has strong regulatory controls and support systems that mitigate risks and empower Australians to confidently take advantage of the benefits of the internet.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is developing a new Online Safety Act that will strengthen the eSafety Commissioner's powers and increase the responsibility on industry to keep their users safe.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Online Content Scheme, set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</span>, regulates prohibited and potentially prohibited online content in Australia based on the National Classification Scheme. Content is assessed following a complaint made to the eSafety Commissioner. If the eSafety Commissioner finds content hosted in Australia to be prohibited content, the Commissioner will direct the content provider to remove or prevent access to the content. For content hosted overseas found to be prohibited, the URL to the material is added to the Commissioner's prohibited URLs list.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The eSafety Commissioner's list of prohibited URLs is distributed to PC filter vendors accredited under an Industry Code of Practice. This is more commonly known as the 'family friendly filter' scheme. Internet service providers (ISPs) offer these filters to their customers. However, it is the customer's decision to purchase and use them.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is unlikely that the content referred to in the petition would be prohibited under these arrangements. However, if the petitioners are of the view that content is prohibited under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting Services Act 1</span><span style="font-style:italic;">992</span>, they may wish to report the material to the eSafety Commissioner.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition also raises concerns about the impacts of the internet and social media, particularly for young people. Many families, communities and researchers around the world have expressed concern about the potential association between internet use and personal wellbeing. This is an important policy issue that the Government takes seriously. eSafety undertakes research on the trends in online safety that can be found at www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/research.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government strongly supports international efforts to develop, manufacture and fairly allocate the tools needed to overcome COVID-19, including a vaccine once available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia supports key ACT Accelerator mechanisms established to promote accelerated development, production and equitable access to COVID-19 treatments, diagnostics and vaccines, for both developing and developed countries. Australia is a confirmed self-financing country of the Gavi-led COVAX Facility, one of the main pillars of the ACT Accelerator, which will provide an avenue to vaccines supply across the world and made an upfront payment of$123 million to help in its vital work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is proud to have also made an investment of $80 million to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment to benefit the region, particularly the highest risk populations. On 5 May 2020, the Government provided $7.5 million to the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) and $7.5 million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) to develop COVID-19 diagnostics and vaccines respectively. FIND's work improving the world's capacity for COVID-19 testing and quality of these tests sits under the ACT Accelerator's diagnostics pillar. CEPI's support for nine COVID-19 vaccine candidates' research sits under the ACT Accelerator's vaccine pillar.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your representation of 19 October 2020 concerning petition number EN1717. The petition requests that the House initiate processes for me to suspend the Principal Member of the Veterans' Review Board (VRB), pursuant to section 164 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Entitlement Act 1986 </span>(VEA) and, that I in turn, then recommend to the Governor-General that the Principal Member for the VRB be removed from office on the grounds of "misbehaviour".</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition has been lodged in relation to the processes and procedures in place at the VRB and the Repatriation Commission (Commission) which were the subject of the Federal Court decision in <span style="font-style:italic;">Shafran v Repatriation Commission </span>[2019] FCA 1833 <span style="font-style:italic;">(Shafran No. 1). </span>In that decision, the Court considered the operation of section 137 of the VEA, which sets out a process for the Department of Veterans' Affairs to prepare a report of the information relevant to a veteran's appeal to the VRB. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Shafran No. 1, </span>the Court found that the relevant processes adopted by the VRB, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) and the Commission were not consistent with the legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Court made specific reference to the VRB's Section 137 Practice Direction, which it found did not comply with the relevant legislative requirements. The Practice Direction reflected longstanding DVA practice to allow appeals before the VRB to proceed more quickly, with a view to potentially resolving matters in a more timely way. Accordingly, the Practice Direction was designed with the interests of veterans in mind.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a result of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Shafran No. 1 </span>decision, the VRB removed the Section 137 Practice Direction from its website. In addition, DVA quickly amended its processes in relation to VRB appeals to ensure conformity with the Court's interpretation. DVA is also currently considering whether further action is necessary to achieve greater clarity and continued compliance with the relevant requirements, for the benefit of veterans. Additional training will also be provided to departmental staff once the new processes have been finalised.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I do not believe there was any intention on the part of the VRB to bypass any legislative processes required in order to properly vest it with jurisdiction over an appeal. In fact, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Shafran {No. 1), </span>the Court noted that the law in relation to VRB appeals is unclear and had not previously been the subject of detailed judicial consideration. The Court also commented that the Principal Member and other members had approached their duties in good faith.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I therefore do not agree that there was any "misbehaviour" on the part of the Principal Member of the VRB. It follows that I will not be suspending the Principal Member of the VRB nor making any recommendation to the Governor-General under s164(3} of the VEA in relation to removal from office. The Principal Member of the VRB is crucial in helping to ensure that relevant processes are in line with the legislation on an ongoing basis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for taking the time to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely </span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020 concerning Petition EN1779 seeking a review of Australia's travel restrictions for Australian citizens and permanent residents seeking to leave Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, from 1 February 2020, the Australian Government has progressively announced travel restrictions to curb the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in Australia. From 25 March 2020, travel restrictions have been in place prohibiting Australian citizens and permanent residents from leaving Australia, unless they fall within certain exempt categories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's travel restrictions have been implemented in response to a declared human biosecurity emergency. Declaration of such an emergency empowers the Minister for Health, the Hon Greg Hunt MP, to issue directions and set requirements necessary to prevent or control the entry, emergence, establishment or spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Outgoing travel is being managed by exception during this emergency period.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The travel restrictions have been successful in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Australia and were implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The majority of travel exemption requests to depart Australia are finalised within 48 hours, but some complex requests may take longer. Where a prospective traveller presents at the border and they are found not to be in an already exempt category and they do not hold an individual exemption, an authorised decision-maker may decide a request for exemption from Australia's travel restrictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Publishing of the Commissioner's guidelines and the Operation Directives has contributed to the transparency in the decision-making processes. Applicants seeking a travel exemption have more information available, enabling them to submit a complete application with the supporting documents to support their claims.. The guidelines and the operation directives are available on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/leaving-australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The publicly available guidelines outline that the Commissioner expects a person requesting an exemption to provide relevant supporting information, as far as can be reasonably expected, in the circumstances of the proposed travel. The Commissioner agrees that there may be some circumstances where documentation may not be provided due to the urgent nature of the grounds for requesting an exemption—such as where a close relative is critically ill and likely to die. A lack of documents in these circumstances, in and of itself, is not a sufficient reason to refuse a person's request for discretionary exemption.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Decisions to grant exemptions must be balanced against the Government's intent for imposing the travel restrictions, that is, the potential health risks posed to the Australian community by returning international travellers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These measures are temporary and are reviewed regularly. Further information on travel exemptions is available on the Department's website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this Petition to my attention. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020 concerning petition number EN1783, on the sale of plastic cotton buds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that single-use plastics, including cotton buds, are one of our biggest litter problems. To deal with the impacts of waste plastics including cotton buds, the Government is working with states and territories to implement the National Waste Policy Action Plan 2019. The Action Plan sets out the Australian Government's policy direction for waste management and recycling in Australia to 2030.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">One of the targets in the National Action Plan is to phase out problematic and unnecessary plastics through design, innovation or the introduction of sustainable alternatives by 2025 or sooner. In addition, the Australian Government will deliver a National Plastics Plan in early 2021. The National Plastics Plan will consider various options and initiatives to reduce plastic pollution by targeting every stage of the plastic lifecycle. It will also recognise that everyone, including governments, industry and the community, has a vital role to play in how we manage our plastic waste. More information on the Government's plastics strategies can be found at: environment.gov.au/protection/waste-resource-recovery/plastics-and-packaging.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Several states and territories have recently introduced legislation to phase-out certain single use plastics. The ACT and WA are currently investigating phasing out cotton buds with plastic sticks, and other states may consider similar phase outs in the future. The Australian Government will work with the states and territories to harmonise these state-led phaseouts where possible.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I also note that retailers and brand owners are voluntarily phasing out some single-use plastics. For example, ALDI committed to introduce paper-stemmed cotton buds by the end of 2020, which will avoid over 357 million plastic stems ending up in landfill and the environment each year. I look forward to seeing similar commitments from other major retailers in the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To encourage industry to take greater responsibility for the products and materials that it creates, the Government has committed $20 million to the National Product Stewardship Investment Fund. I am pleased to advise that through this scheme the Government will fund 9 projects to the value of $7 million that address plastic waste streams. One such project will develop Australia's largest industry-led plastic recycling scheme, which aims to collect and recycle nearly 190,000 tonnes of plastic packaging (such as bread, cereal and frozen vegetable bags and confectionary wrappers) per year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners also raise important points on the issue of marine debris. Marine plastic debris, which is largely comprised of land-sourced plastics, poses a significant risk to marine ecosystems and wildlife. That is why the Government has developed the <span style="font-style:italic;">Threat Abatement Plan</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">for the impacts of marine debris on the vertebrate wildlife of Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s coasts</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">and oceans (2018</span>). This plan seeks to reduce the amount of plastic waste entering the oceans and becoming marine debris. A copy of the plan is available at: </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/tap/marine-debris-2018.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To complement the plan, the Government has engaged the Tangaroa Blue Foundation, working in partnership with Conservation Volunteers Australia, to deliver a five-year $5 million program of local actions to raise awareness and educate communities on the dangers of marine debris as well as to prevent the flow of debris into the reef lagoons. The Government will make further announcements about reducing the amount of plastic debris entering waterways and oceans when the National Plastics Plan is launched this year. I hope this information serves to demonstrate that tackling plastic pollution is a key priority for the Australian Government and that the we are undertaking ambitious steps to address this national challenge.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning petition EN1784 with seven (7) signatures, relating to access to bank loans for people with a disability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Disability Discrimination Act 1992</span>, a person with disability has a right to obtain goods and use services in the same way as people without disability. This includes goods and services from lenders such as banks, credit unions and building societies. Lenders cannot refuse service to people with disability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, under their prudential obligations, authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) such as banks, building societies and credit unions, are required to undertake credit assessments of prospective borrowers, including people with disability. Credit providers are also required to adhere to responsible lending obligations in the consumer credit law. The operation of these two obligations may restrict access to credit for some people. I note the Government is reforming the responsible lending obligations to simplify Australia's credit framework to ensure consumers get more timely access to credit, particularly as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If a person believes they have been discriminated against because of their disability they can make a complaint to the Australian Human Rights Commission. The commission is an independent third party which investigates complaints about discrimination and human rights breaches. A person can also make a complaint about the conduct of their lender to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, which has the power to award compensation.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, from 1 February 2020, the Australian Government has progressively announced travel restrictions to curb the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in Australia.. From 25 March 2020, travel. restrictions have been in place prohibiting Australian citizens and permanent residents from leaving Australia, unless they fall within certain exempt categories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's travel restrictions have been implemented in response to a declared human biosecurity emergency. Declaration of such an emergency empowers the Minister for Health, the Hon Greg Hunt MP, to issue directions and set requirements necessary to prevent or control the entry, emergence, establishment or spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Outgoing travel is being managed by exception during this emergency period.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The travel restrictions have been successful in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Australia and decisions to ease the travel restrictions will be implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020 concerning Petition EN1810 seeking removal of the requirement for Australian citizens to obtain a travel exemption to depart Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, from 1 February 2020, the Australian Government has progressively announced travel restrictions to curb the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in Australia. From 25 March 2020, travel restrictions have been in place prohibiting Australian citizens and permanent residents from leaving Australia, unless they fall within certain exempt categories.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's travel restrictions have been implemented in response to a declared human biosecurity emergency. Declaration of such an emergency empowers the Minister for Health, the Hon Greg Hunt MP, to issue directions and set requirements necessary to prevent or control the entry, emergence, establishment or spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Outgoing travel is being managed by exception during this emergency period.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The travel restrictions have been successful in slowing. the spread of COVID-19 in Australia and were implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Decisions to change the existing criteria for outwards travel must be balanced against the Government's intent for imposing the travel ban, that is, potential health risks posed to the Australian community by returning international travellers.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 October 2020 concerning petition number EN1818, on the sale and provision of single-use plastics by major retailers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is strongly committed to reducing waste, increasing recycling rates and building capacity in Australia's recycling industry. Each year, Australia generates 67 million tonnes of waste, the equivalent of 2.7 tonnes for every person every year. The Government recognises the importance of Australia's environmental sustainability, and both the challenges and opportunities in front of us when it comes to plastics and waste more broadly. We are working with state and territory governments to improve Australia's waste management and increase recycling. The Government encourages and welcomes the contribution and leadership from business, state and local governments and local communities to address Australia's waste and recycling challenges.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 8 November 2019, all of Australia's environment ministers agreed to the National Waste Policy Action Plan, which sets the policy direction and targets to reduce plastic waste and increase our recycling rates. One of the targets in the National Action Plan is to phase out problematic and unnecessary plastics, with an agreed action for the Government to deliver a National Plastics Plan by the end of 2020. The National Plastics Plan will consider various options and initiatives to reduce plastic pollution by targeting every stage of the plastic lifecycle. It also recognises that everyone, including governments, industry and the community, has a vital role to play in how we manage our plastic waste.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I also note the petitioners' concerns about plastic packaging. The Government supports the industry-led National Packaging Targets, to be achieved by 2025:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">70 per cent of Australia's plastic packaging being recycled or composted</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">50 per cent average recycled content included across all packaging</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">phasing out problematic and unnecessary single-use plastic packaging through design, innovation or introduction of alternatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These targets will help meet the ambitious overall target for 100 per cent of Australian packaging to be recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025, as agreed to by all Australia's environment ministers in 2018.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To encourage industry to take greater responsibility for the products and materials that it creates, the Government has committed $20 million for a Product Stewardship Investment Fund to accelerate work on new industry-led schemes and increase recycling rates of existing schemes. I am pleased to announce that through this scheme, the Government will be funding 15 projects to the value of $10.5 million that address plastic waste streams. One such project will develop Australia's largest industry-led plastic recycling scheme, which aims to collect and recycle nearly 190,000 tonnes of plastic packaging (such as bread, cereal and frozen vegetable bags and confectionary wrappers) each year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Industry is taking note and, in line with the 2025 targets, is shifting practice away from using problematic plastics. For example, Coles and Woolworths supermarkets no longer provide single-use plastic shopping bags in their stores, with customers instead having the option to purchase reusable bags that are mostly made from recycled plastic. Once these bags can no longer be used, these along with other soft plastics can be recycled through the REDcycle bins that can be found in all Coles and Woolworths stores. These actions, combined with state and territory bans on single use plastic bags, have resulted in a 77 per cent decrease in Australia's consumption of lightweight plastic bags in only three years (2016-17 and 2018-19).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You might also be aware that Woolworths has partnered with TerraCycle to help customers recycle their collectible plastic toys. Similar to REDcycle, toys can be returned in-store and recycled into new products such as fences, benches and decks. Coles has also moved towards more sustainable collectible campaigns by offering collectible books which are made from responsibly sourced (Forest Stewardship Council certified) paper and are fully recyclable through your kerbside bin at home.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I also note, ALDI has recently made a commitment to reduce plastic packaging in their stores by 25 per cent. Measures that ALDI plan to take to achieve this target include switching to cardboard punnets for a range of fruit and vegetable lines, introducing compostable zucchini trays (diverting over 76 tonnes of plastic from landfill), and introducing paper-stemmed cotton buds by the end of 2020 which will avoid over 357 million plastic stems ending up in landfill each year.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I hope this background serves to demonstrate that tackling single-use plastics is a major priority for the Government. We are undertaking a comprehensive and ambitious program to address this significant national challenge in close collaboration with industry and state and territory governments.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 9 November 2020 regarding petition number EN1869 on Brisbane Airports' parallel runway operations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition seeks Airservices Australia (Airservices) to revise the operating plan and modes of operation related to Brisbane Airport operations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Managing aircraft noise is a difficult issue and I appreciate the concerns of the petitioners about increased aircraft operations from Brisbane Airport affecting residents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In response to community feedback regarding the new runway operations, the Australian Government (through Airservices) is working closely with Brisbane Airport and other key stakeholders to identify opportunities for improved noise outcomes. The Australian Government remains committed to implementing appropriate measures to encourage noise sharing of operations at Brisbane Ai<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">rp</span>ort, ensuring safety requirements are the first priority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The text of the petition indicates that the night mode of operations is immediately ceased from 6am each morning, even when conditions and traffic levels make the continuation of night­ time modes feasible. Airservices advises that usage of the night-time modes outside of the period between 10pm and 6am is 27.5 per cent, which demonstrates that these operations are being extended when conditions permit. Recent data shows that these extended periods of night-mode operation are extending, where conditions have permitted, through until 9.30am.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Petitioners have also raised the potential opportunity for noise improvement by increasing the current 5 knot tailwind limit to 10 knots in certain conditions. Brisbane Airport is working with Airservices to explore the information and analysis necessary to support such a change. Any change to this tailwind limit would need to be approved by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), as this limit is applied through regulation at all Australian ai<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">rp</span>orts and is consistent with international standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Airservices has also identified and put in place an additional noise abatement procedure that restricts the use of the northern approach over the Brisbane River by jet aircraft.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing your concerns to my attention and I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, from 1 February 2020, the Australian Government has progressively announced travel restrictions to curb the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in Australia. From 25 March 2020, travel restrictions have been in place prohibiting Australian citizens and permanent residents from leaving Australia, unless they fall within certain exempt categories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's travel restrictions have been implemented in response to a declared human biosecurity emergency. Declaration of such an emergency empowers the Minister for Health, the Hon Greg Hunt MP, to issue directions and set requirements necessary to prevent or control the entry, emergence, establishment or spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Outgoing travel is being managed by exception during this emergency period.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The travel restrictions have been successful in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Australia, and were implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 9 November 2020 regarding the petition (EN1910) submitted to the House of Representatives advocating for the Bruce Highway-Tiaro Flood Immunity Upgrade Project (the Project) to deliver a four-lane highway bypass.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that on 2 December 2020 you submitted another petition (PN0488) to the House on this matter, with a notable increase in the number of signatures. Both these petitions highlight concerns that a two-lane bypass design may not adequately address safety issues or cater for future demand.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you may be aware, the Project scope is to deliver a bypass at Tiaro that will improve flood immunity, reduce congestion and remove heavy vehicle traffic away from Tiaro's township to significantly improve safety and liveability for residents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Project's business case is currently under development. As part of this process, traffic modelling for future demand has been undertaken. The Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads has advised that a two-lane option will provide sufficient capacity to cater for current and foreseeable traffic demand, however the business case will consider opportunities to support future duplication.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The business case will also identify the most appropriate safety treatments for the bypass, including consideration of grade separated interchanges and a concrete dividing barrier to reduce the risk of head-on collisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am advised that the business case is expected to be completed by mid-2021 and its outcomes will inform the preferred design. While I understand that this is a matter of importance to the local community, it would be imprudent for the Australian Government to make any formal amendments to the commitment until the outcomes of the business case are known.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">First, the High Court dismissed Mr Clive Palmer's challenge to Western Australian border restrictions. On 6 November 2020, the High Court made orders in <span style="font-style:italic;">Palmer v Western Australia, </span>dismissing Mr Palmer's constitutional challenge to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Quarantine (Closing the Border) Directions </span>(WA). The Court found that the enabling legislation, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Emergency Management Act 2005 </span>(WA), did not impermissibly infringe section 92 of the Constitution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 92 provides for the freedom of interstate trade, commerce and movement. The Court will publish the reasons for its decision at a later date.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly, also on 6 November 2020, the High Court rejected a challenge to Victorian directions restricting the movement of people within Victoria due to the pandemic, in Gerner v Victoria. Mr Gerner had argued that the directions were contrary to an implied constitutional freedom of movement but the-High Court decided that no such general freedom exists.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petitioners' concern that restrictions need to be based on public health considerations. Freedom of movement between the states, within reasonable bounds, is an important constitutional safeguard. However, the Government acknowledges community concern about the spread of COVID-19. The Government is seeking to work cooperatively with state and territory governments to ease domestic border restrictions where it is safe to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments will have their own procedures for seeking appropriate advice, including medical and legal advice, when putting in place public health measures. The petitioners may wish to address any specific concerns about state laws to the relevant state government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter with me.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 30 November 2020 concerning petition number EN2014, on banning the use, sale, import and export of all toxic non-biodegradable plastics.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government takes the issue of plastic waste and its impacts on the environment very seriously. The Government is working with states and territories to implement the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Waste Policy Action Plan 2019</span>, which sets out the policy direction for priority actions on waste management and recycling in Australia to 2030. The Plan includes a target to phase out problematic and unnecessary plastics through sustainable design, innovation or the introduction of sustainable alternatives by 2025 or sooner. The Government has also committed to delivering a National Plastics Plan in early 2021 that will address problematic plastics, including non-certified compostable plastic packaging such as oxo-degradable, landfill degradable or other claimed degradable plastics.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there is increasing interest from industry and consumers about biodegradable plastics, the term biodegradable can mislead users to think that because something is biodegradable it is also non-toxic. Some biodegradable plastics release toxic components into the environment as they degrade, fragmenting into microplastics that further contribute to plastic pollution. It is important that plastics that claim to be biodegradable are certified compostable under Australian Standards to ensure they safely biodegrade. The Australian Competitive Consumer Commission (ACCC) is committed to investigating greenwashing and false claims of plastic biodegradability. The ACCC also has the power to place bans on plastics that contain toxic chemicals, such as the permanent ban on children's toys, dummies and bibs that contain more than one per cent of the toxic chemical DEHP (Diethylhexyl Phthalate).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As Australia transitions towards a circular economy, maximising the lifecycle of plastics through recycling and reuse is critical to minimising its impact on the environment. The Government is taking action through its $167 million Australian Recycling Investment Plan, which includes $100 million to support new recycling and re-manufacturing facilities and $20 million for new product stewardship schemes, and more than $11 million for community groups to clean up plastic and rubbish from our beaches and rivers. The Government has also invested $190 million into the Recycling Modernisation Fund (RMF). The RMF will leverage $600 million to transform Australia's recycling capability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also supports the work of the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO) to create a sustainable pathway for packaging in Australia and deliver the industry-led National Packaging Targets. The Targets set clear objectives to improve the sustainability of all product packaging which will see by 2025: 70 per cent of plastic packaging being recycled or composted, 50 per cent average recycled content in packaging, and the phase out of problematic and unnecessary single-use plastic packaging. These targets will help meet the overall target of 100 per cent of Australian packaging being recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To assist industry understand compostable packaging, APCO released guidelines for compostable plastic packaging in May 2020. Further, in 2021 APCO, the Australasian Bioplastics Association, and the Australian Organics Recycling Association will deliver a National Compostable Packaging Strategy to optimise the use of compostable packaging in Australia and provide pathways for industry to increase the use of compostable materials.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While it is not currently feasible to make all plastics biodegradable due to their varied applications and technical needs, the Government is committed to improving the recyclability and circularity of plastics. To assist in achieving this objective, the Government is investing over $20 million through a special round of the Cooperative Research Centres Projects to find new and innovative solutions to plastic recycling and waste, including new ways of incorporating recycled plastics in manufacturing and construction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petitioners raise important points on the issue of marine debris. Marine plastic debris, which is largely comprised of land-sourced plastics, poses a significant risk to marine ecosystems and wildlife. That is why the Government has developed the <span style="font-style:italic;">Threat Abatement</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Plan for the impacts of marine debris on the vertebrate wildlife of Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s coasts</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">and oceans (2018</span>). This plan seeks to reduce the amount of plastic waste entering the oceans and becoming marine debris. A copy of the plan is available at: </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/tap/marine-debris-2018.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To complement the Plan, the Government has engaged the Tangaroa Blue Foundation, working in partnership with Conservation Volunteers Australia, to deliver a five-year $5 million program of local actions to raise awareness and educate communities on the dangers of marine debris as well as to prevent the flow of debris into the reef lagoons. The Government will make further announcements about reducing the amount of plastic debris entering waterways and oceans when the National Plastics Plan is launched.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I hope this information serves to demonstrate that tackling plastic pollution in all forms is a major priority for the Government. We are committed to addressing this significant national challenge in close collaboration with industry and state and territory governments. Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 30 November 2020 concerning petition number EN2017 improving the gap payment process for GP clinics.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to supporting Australians to access quality, timely and affordable health care by providing rebates for services listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). Government payments for MBS services are administered by Services Australia, including the 90-day Pay Doctor via Claimant cheque for unpaid or partially paid medical accounts referred to in the petition. The decision to use this scheme rather than use the available electronic funds transfer systems are policies of the provider or their practice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Alternative payment systems offer providers and patients fast and secure transfers of Medicare rebates. The Medicare Online system enables electronic payments for claims generally within two to three days of the claim, while the Medicare Easyclaim system enables patients to pay their private account and have their Medicare rebate paid directly to their bank account through the EFTPOS terminal in the practice. More information on these payment options is available from the Services Australia website: www.servicesaustralia.gov.au and by searching the term 'Health Professional Online Services'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Separately and in relation to the affordability of health care, the Government is committed to ensuring that all Australians have access to timely, affordable and high quality health services. The Government is implementing its significant commitments to guaranteeing Medicare and strengthening primary care. Combined measures with a total investment more than $1 billion were announced through the 2018-19 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and the 2019-20 Budget. This is in addition to more than $1 billion over four years in the 2017-18 Budget to re-introduce annual indexation of Medicare rebates, which commenced in 2017. As of July 2019, all MBS services are indexed annually.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government is responsible for setting the level of the Medicare rebates, doctors are able to place their own value on the services they provide and are free to decide whether to bulk bill all, some or none of their patients. Doctors are encouraged to consider the personal circumstances of their patients when setting the fees that they charge. To encourage doctors to bulk bill patients who may find it more difficult to meet the costs of medical services, the Government provides financial incentives for bulk billed services for Commonwealth Concession Card holders and children under 16 years of age.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If patients require a bulk billed service in their area the 'find a service' feature of Healthdirect at: www.healthdirect.gov.au may be helpful. Healthdirect, funded by the Australian and state and territory governments, helps patients to identify local medical services appropriate to their needs. Using HealthDirect, patients can find information about practice location, available services and billing policies, including whether fees apply, if bulk billing is available for some patients, or if all services are bulk billed.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 30 November 2020 regarding Petition EN2019, which requests that the Government release exposure draft legislation to establish a federal anti-corruption body for a period of public consultation by 20 March 2021. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring our federal integrity framework is as robust as possible to maximise public confidence in our national institutions. That is why the government has committed to establishing a Commonwealth Integrity Commission (CIC) to strengthen integrity arrangements across the federal public sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CIC will be a centralised, specialist centre for investigating corruption in the public sector. It will be established as an independent statutory agency, led by the Integrity Commissioner and assisted by the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner and the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner. The CIC will comprise:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">a law enforcement integrity division—this will have the same functions and powers as the current Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI), but with a broader jurisdiction; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">a public sector integrity division—this will investigate alleged criminal corruption involving government departments and their staff, parliamentarians and their staff, the staff of federal judicial officers, and in appropriate circumstances, recipients of Commonwealth funds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CIC will target serious criminal corruption that presents a threat to good public administration. Existing integrity agencies will be able to refer matters to the CIC, and vice versa.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The first phase of the government's plan for a CIC is already underway. ACLEI's jurisdiction will be expanded from 1 January 2021 to cover four new agencies, with additional funding and staff allocated to ACLEI for those functions in the 2020-21 Budget.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The second phase will be full delivery of the CIC by legislation, which will subsume ACLEI and cover the remainder of the public sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 2 November 2020, the Australian Government released an exposure draft of the legislation to complete the implementation of the CIC. The draft legislation is the result of detailed planning to ensure the new body has both the resources and powers that it · needs to investigate allegations of criminal conduct that could occur across the public sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government is committed to a national comprehensive consultation process on the draft legislation and is inviting feedback on the draft legislation and other considerations via written submissions. Submissions are due to cic.consultation@ag.gov.au by 5pm AEDT on 12 February 2021. Further information about the consultation process, including how to make a submission using the submission template, can be found at </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, I feel like the proverbial goldfish going around and around in the bowl.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Here I am again. Oh, look, there's the minister out there making the same announcement for the third time.'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But he doesn't actually make any of the changes he announces, so around we go and here we are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill should not be necessary, as the minister should have fixed this problem with a stroke of a pen last year, by just amending the migration regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But he has failed to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we are again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is very simple: it's just common sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All it does is allow people who are already safe here in Australia to stay here and have their offshore visa granted in Australia, instead of having to fly overseas and back again during the pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Literally, that's it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will predominantly benefit untold thousands of partners of Australians or their parents, as they're the most common of these visa categories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the bill would fix the same problem for more than 30 other visa types.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's current regulations contain what could be called the FOFI rule—the fly-out and fly-in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rule requires applicants for visas who originally applied when they were offshore and who are already in Australia to leave Australia just so their visa can be granted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Traditionally people took a quick trip to Bali or New Zealand and came back, and that was okay. But we're in the middle of a global pandemic! We don't want people taking risky trips overseas if they don't have to: transiting through international airports and hotels, then flying back to Australia to quarantine, risking the spread of more contagious forms of COVID-19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would also benefit a small number of Australians who are stuck or working overseas from being forced to fly in and fly out. I spoke a few weeks ago to a man who applied for his wife's partner visa two or three years ago when they were living in Australia. They've now relocated to Germany for work and they're due to come back to Australia in July next year, but the government has told them their visa is ready to be granted but they have to come back to Australia in the next few months—in a pandemic! If they don't come back, they'll have wasted the $8,000 fee and years waiting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But on quarantine right now there are 40,000 Australians still stranded overseas, desperate to come home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister just keeps making announcements. He promised they'd be home by Christmas, but it's all spin. The queue just keeps getting longer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be very clear why. It's because the Prime Minister has refused to take responsibility for anything difficult.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Constitution, quarantine is a Commonwealth responsibility, yet for nearly a year the Prime Minister has just ducked and weaved, blaming the states for the lack of capacity or the issues we've seen across the country with hotel quarantine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing is ever the Prime Minister's responsibility! He's just a powerless and impotent little man—until there's credit to be snatched then he pops up on TV, wraps a few flags around him and pretends he's in charge of something.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's bad enough that the Prime Minister has failed to act, but it's beyond ridiculous that the Morrison government has itself been caught wasting precious quarantine places by forcing people to make unnecessary trips overseas just so the computer will spit out their visa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has affected the partners, the parents and the children of Australian citizens and the employees of Australian businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will stop this madness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I honestly have no idea why the minister hasn't just fixed this. I really don't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's known about this problem for nearly a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've written numerous letters. I've spoken to successive ministers. Australians have bombarded these ministers, crying out for common sense to prevail, but ministers have inexplicably failed to act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have however announced the same thing three times!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In November, the then minister made a panicked Saturday night announcement to try and shut down negative media criticism two days ahead of the last bill I introduced relating to partner visas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Note that point: common sense or decency does not work with this Liberal government. They don't respond to real problems or ordinary people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're not a government, they're a marketing department masquerading as a government, so they only respond to negative media stories. Makes sense I suppose given they're led by a mini-Trump populist Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But after the minister's announcement in late November, nothing actually happened!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No detail, no timeline, no certainty. Just an announcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So thousands of Australian families were forced to spend thousands of dollars more on visa extensions and other fees over Christmas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the minister announced that he would make the change for partners of Australians, we were bombarded by the parents of Australians who had been offered a parent visa. They spoke up and they said, 'Hey, government, if you're going to change this stupid rule for partners, why not us?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are older people, more vulnerable to COVID who the government was sending threatening letters to saying, 'You need to fly out of Australia within 28 days then fly back again to have your $46,000 visa granted.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's response to this was that 'parents are not family members'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought it was a joke when a journalist told me that was the minister's response. Then I saw it in the newspaper and in countless letters to Australians:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Parents are not immediate family members.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so in December I gave notice of this bill and the media campaign continued. I want to thank all the courageous people who spoke up and shared their story. I've been in touch personally with hundreds of Australians and I understand now the pain, the cost and the impact of the government's ongoing failure to act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a moment of hope when the previous minister—the guy who presided over the robodebt fiasco, the guy who wasted $92 million on a failed visa and citizenship privatisation and did nothing about this mess—got promoted to be the education minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mean good for him! It's terrible for schools, TAFEs and universities, but I thought: 'Well, he's gone. Maybe the next one will show some common sense.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But no. The threatening letters kept coming, telling parents to leave and come back again.</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:none underline;" />The spin cycle repeated itself though because eventually, to shut down the negative media, the new minister made a second announcement in late January, that he would change the rule for partners <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">and also for parents!</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mean if we're trying to be glass half full, we could ignore the fact he just announced the same thing a second time for partners, and focus on the fact that suddenly parents are family!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But then two days ago, we got a third announcement, as the minister again panicked to shut down ongoing negative media ahead of this debate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This time the minister announced some dates on which he 'intended' to make the changes. That's not a commitment to do so. It's just an intention.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">People keep forking out thousands of dollars, hand over fist, for visa fees, health and character checks, flight cancellations and changes, and international student fees, in some cases, for their kids—tens of thousands of dollars because the minister can't find his pen and sign the bit of paper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">People don't trust this government to deliver—some people have gone and come back again, wasting tens of thousands of dollars on flights and quarantine places. I've heard from families about the anxiety and fear that the uncertainty is causing, especially for elderly parents. It might sound silly in here, but people have these letters. They believe what the government says—that they have to leave—and they're scared of dying from COVID when they're forced to go overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final thing I'll say is that this bill fixes the whole problem, not just part of the problem.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has only said it will fix this rule for partners and parents.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not the more than 30 other visa categories that would still be forced to make unnecessary overseas trips during the pandemic.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A most egregious example is an emergency doctor I spoke with who has been working in a major Melbourne hospital for more than two years. The government has finally advised him and his wife that their 461 permanent resident visas are ready to be granted—but he and his wife, a busy engineer, have to fly overseas and back again to get them. The government's changes won't affect that visa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a doctor he told me he knows just how dangerous COVID is. Why would the government force anyone to fly overseas and back again?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So he went to his local MP, the member for Higgins, who's sitting over there—she is herself a doctor—but she failed to act or speak up for him. She might have been too busy on Sky News or something. It was unbelievable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So even if the government eventually does what they've announced, it will still not fix the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The principle underlying this bill is that no person should be forced to make an unnecessary, expensive and risky overseas trip during a pandemic just to have their visa granted. The proposition is that the minister should have the power to grant any visa onshore or offshore during the pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's common sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course even if this bill passes it's of no comfort to numerous Australians who have blown their savings making that risky trip. One couple reported in the media spent $67,000 on airfares, delays and quarantine overseas and in Australia just to get their visa granted; they were already safe here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And there remains a much, much bigger mess in the partner visa program. Tens of thousands of couples remain separated, not because of the pandemic, but because of the government's cruel, illegal mismanagement of the partner visa program over many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget announcements don't go nearly far enough and entrench effective discrimination. The plight of prospective marriage 300 visa holders is especially fraught and cruel. I will have more to say on this elsewhere.</span>

Australia should always have been at the rank of other countries who require some form of parliamentary or congressional approval before they send troops off to war or keep them there. But it is especially timely again now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's timely again now because of the incredibly serious documentation of war crimes by our elite special forces in Afghanistan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The four-and-a-half year inquiry that culminated in the Brereton report shows why such powers are needed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a point that my colleague Senator Steele-John made in the other place. He made the point: "It is now clear"—with respect to that war and the findings from the report—"that continual deployment without strategic direction was a clear part of the context in which these crimes occurred. This legislation would ensure that in future we are clear on our purpose for engaging"—or re-engaging or continuing to engage—"in armed conflict abroad and allow for a re-examination of the case for continuing."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is too late to stop what those 19 special forces soldiers did, and that should now be referred to the authorities, the AFP, for war crimes, but what this bill can do is minimise the chance of it happening again in countries that have been afflicted by war.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill does is require the approval of this parliament for the deployment of Australian troops overseas. There are provisions in the bill that deal with exigent circumstances where urgent decisions need to be made but provide that parliament would be called and recalled very quickly to approve decisions that are made. That would allow for a full debate in the first place about whether or not we should be putting our troops in harm's way and potentially exposing them to death, but also, importantly, this bill would require the parliament to make that approval ongoing. In other words, it requires the parliament to be informed about the progress of wars the parliament has approved that Australia's troops get involved in and also the continual re-approval. That would allow parliament to potentially help prevent the kinds of atrocities that we saw, because it would require parliament to be making strategic decisions about whether or not we should be continuing to put our troops in harm's way. That has been something that has been sorely lacking: the parliament has been denied the opportunity to debate whether we should go to war or whether we should stay at war.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we are putting Australian soldiers' lives on the line we owe it to them to at least have that debate and then to say that the parliament is backing the decision. The parliament, being the overseer for the deployment of troops, is supported by 84 per cent of Australians, according to a recent Roy Morgan poll, which is a six per cent bump since that same question was asked in 2014 after then Prime Minister Tony Abbott decided Australia would invade Syria. We owe it to our constituents to support this bill. It is their democracy. It is their armed forces, their neighbours and their loved ones who may have to go off and fight. It can't be another 35 years of brazen, unchecked warmongering before this bill finally passes and the parliament can have the final say on who lives, who dies and who we trust not to violate the human rights of others in conflict situations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is difficult to understand the objection to this unless you are an executive government who wants to preserve the right to send troops overseas for political purposes. That could be the only reason to run and hide from the scrutiny, because all this bill is asking is for a debate and an approval by this parliament before we send troops off to war. We have been involved in too many political wars over the years. Too many wars have been commenced or have been continued for political reasons, not because Australia's national interest is under threat. We have been the only country that has followed the United States into every war, and it has had huge consequences for our people and for our troops. It is time, if we are to be truthful in our commitment to our members of the Australian Defence Force, to at least have the debate here before we deploy troops and continue to approve their deployment. In the remaining time that I have, I invite the seconder of this bill to contribute to the debate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:23</span>):  I second the bill and note that parliamentary war powers reform is something that the member for Melbourne and I have been advocating for for a great many years. In Australia, the Prime Minister alone can send the country to war, which is dangerous, unnecessary, outdated and out of step with the practice in many parliamentary democracies, including the United States, the United Kingdom and a number of countries in Western Europe. We have seen the gut-wrenching impact of this in the dreadful and ongoing consequences of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. That shocking and unnecessary intervention, almost exactly 18 years ago, was decided upon on a whim by then Prime Minister John Howard personally. It was a war based on a lie, and this parliament must ensure it is never repeated.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision to deploy troops overseas is not one that should be taken lightly. It affects all of us, not just the Defence Force, and should be made by the parliament and not just the Prime Minister and his mates. That he or she consults with the cabinet is simply not good enough. After all, the decision to resort to deadly force is one of the most significant decisions any government can make. It is not some politician's plaything but instead a decision requiring the most stringent scrutiny. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Research released by Roy Morgan late last year shows that over 83 per cent of Australians believe the prerogative to decide whether to send our troops into armed conflict abroad should rest with the parliament. Eighty-three per cent of Australians understand, that going to war is the most momentous decision that can be made on their behalf and, in a democracy, it's their elected representatives who should have that responsibility, not the Prime Minister. So I say to all members: please listen to the Australian people and support the member for Melbourne's private member's bill, because some things should be above party politics and it's undeniable that war powers is one of them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Bureau of Meteorology, Australia is heading towards 4.4 degrees of warming by the year 2100, which undeniably would have a catastrophic impact on every aspect of life in this country. Frankly this is science we simply cannot afford to ignore, so we must rapidly change policy in line with the advice which is to significantly and rapidly reduce our carbon emissions. But so far the government has done the opposite, continuing to muddy the waters on Australian carbon emissions by making false claims that we're on track to meet our modest Paris Agreement targets and continuing to rush it's dangerous and distracting gas led recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the greatest con of all in the government's approach is the claim that we're world leaders on climate change, which ignores the privileged accounting starting position we continue to enjoy and which still gives life to the likelihood of Australia using carry-over credits if it's to achieve any of its climate targets and aspirations. No wonder Dr John Ross, adjunct professor in the School of Natural Sciences at the University of Tasmania, tells me that the only way the government can possibly reach our Paris targets is by continuing to rely on tricky accounting and sheer luck.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said many times before in this place, the foundation of any good policy is expert driven evidence, which is why this morning I'm reintroducing the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Amendment (Transparency in Carbon Emissions Accounting) Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill ensures that greenhouse gas emissions data is promptly made public, keeping the community and experts informed with Australia's latest emissions figures—no more hiding behind major sporting events or national holidays, no more two-month delays while the minister refines his speaking points. No, this amendment creates a legally binding obligation on the minister to table the Greenhouse Gas Inventory updates in parliament no later than 10 days after he or she receives them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has been reviewed by the Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy and I thank the members of the committee, and the groups that submitted to the inquiry, for their input. Based on their feedback I have made some technical amendments to the bill to clarify that the information to be tabled is the quarterly update of the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, as prepared by the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, and also to guarantee that the updates must be given directly to the minister as soon as possible. The minister must then table the updates in parliament to ensure the public has full and prompt access to Australia's greenhouse gas data, preventing the government from hiding or delaying emission figures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's obvious that prompt access to accurate information is essential for good policymaking. Similarly Australians need to know the country's true contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, which is why this bill also ensures that we collect so-called scope 3 emissions data, which are indirect greenhouse gas emissions, and in particular the potential carbon emissions contained in fossil fuels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The implication for including scope 3 emissions in Australia's carbon emissions database is that fossil fuel exports, processed and used in energy generation internationally, would be included in the Australian inventory. This would allow Australia to track its impact as one of the largest exporters of fossil fuels and give the public access to information about Australia's position in contributing to global greenhouse gas emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Including scope 3 emissions would mean we have a full picture of Australia's share of the global emissions budget, which is exactly as it should be seeing as Australia is actually the third-largest exporter of fossil fuels in the world, in CO2 terms, on account of being the world's largest coal and LNG exporter. Frankly it's preposterous that we currently export more than a billion metric tonnes of CO2 potential to countries around the world but still claim to be doing our bit to prevent climate change. We simply can't continue pretending that, even though it's Australia's policies which lead to Australian companies digging up Australian fossil fuels, we have no responsibility for the carbon emissions released as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Australia Institute, Australia's exported fossil fuel CO2 potential is more than double our total domestic emissions. So, by not collecting and publicising this data, the government is pulling the wool over Australians' eyes. Surely we're responsible for the fossil fuels we dig up and ship out, and pretending otherwise is misleading and irresponsible. This bill will remedy that and ensure that the public can see how Australia is tracking in the global effort to reduce emissions. The Prime Minister could no longer downplay the importance of Australia urgently reducing its carbon emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In considering this bill the energy and environment committee was told that including scope 3 would lead to some kind of 'double counting'. But this is a misnomer that hides the real issue because including scope 3 emissions is just another form of analysis that captures Australia's contribution to global greenhouse emissions and does not preclude the collection of scope 1 or 2 emissions data. It simply provides another way to measure our impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely the point of counting emissions in the first place is to see where we can bring them down. So if Australia is responsible for exporting about five per cent of global carbon emissions, and we are, then ultimately we're also responsible for helping to bring them down. And surely the best place to start would be to stop digging the stuff up in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also considered that there is no international obligation to record scope 3 emissions. But surely the fact that this kind of tracking is not required by the Paris Agreement is beside the point, because the Australian government should be open and transparent for the sake of the community, rather than claiming that Australia can do little to influence global climate change. And if scope 3 emissions data gives scientists and the community a better picture of what Australia needs to do to slow catastrophic climate change then we should collect it. It's irrelevant that we're not obliged to do so by any international treaty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Deloitte has estimated that climate change will cost the Australian community $3.4 trillion in GDP by the year 2070. And just last week the Climate Council found climate disasters have already cost Australia $35 billion in the last decade. So for businesses, including some of those 50 ASX 200 companies which already collect scope 3 emissions data, to complain that compliance costs will be too high is just patent nonsense. Frankly if we don't stop digging up fossil fuels then the costs to businesses and the economy, let alone to our communities and natural environment, will be catastrophic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing I simply say that Australia must urgently start doing its fair share to reduce global carbon emissions. The community is crying out for strong action, and the first step is transparency and accountability, not carry over credits and fudging the numbers. I now invite the member for Mayo to offer some remarks in my remaining time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  I am pleased to second this motion and the bill. The member for Clark makes a very simple and very important proposition: where our country has a clear responsibility for carbon emissions that it creates, the Australian people need and deserve transparency. And with transparency comes accountability. The explanatory memorandum to the bill puts the key proposition succinctly. The bill allows Australia to track its impact as one of the largest exporters of fossil fuels in the world and allows the public access to information about Australia's position in contributing to global greenhouse gas emissions. When we possess the facts, we can make reasoned choices in the public interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that it's a tough reality to face up to. A sizeable amount of Australia's prosperity has been and continues to be built on selling resources that are causing dangerous warming to the planet. We must also consider the benefits that our fossil fuel export industry creates for Australian workers and the people we sell our fossil fuels to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we have a moral obligation here. The Australian people and we, its democratic representatives, need to be apprised of the facts so that we can understand and quantify the moral costs along with the benefits. And this bill does exactly that—it seeks to get to the facts, with timely reporting. This is critical. For too long the government has slipped out reports, slipped out data, when it thinks nobody is watching: on grand final eves; I think there have even been some around Christmas. The 10-day period is long enough. There should be no reason for the government to delay any more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's incredibly important that we address this. People want to see transparency. They don't believe we're going to get to our targets 'in a canter', no matter how many times the minister says so. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Big tech companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Google have amassed extraordinary power in the global corporate and political landscape. There is no doubt that 6 January 2021 will be remembered as a dark day in American history. The events of the day and the resulting fallout will be referenced, studied and analysed for years to come. One moment in particular—the permanent banning of Donald Trump's Twitter account—will be a watershed moment in the debate surrounding free speech and censorship on social media platforms and the question of regulation of big tech companies. Thanks to the social media platforms, we have arrived at a new reality, of 'glocalisation', where the local is merged with the global through online portals. We have become increasingly reliant on big tech companies and their services, and governments around the world have not kept pace with these transformations and their consequences. We are now working to catch up.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Freedom of speech is an inherent right that we must protect at all costs, but it is not a right to lie or incite violence. Free speech is vital to our democracy but must be limited to prevent harm. Limitations on free speech, however necessary they may be, will always be contestable. It remains a significant challenge to get these limitations right. However, the problem we face now is that big tech companies are themselves responsible for determining their own limitations. They are acting as the moral arbiters of our society, which, I argue, is the role of representative government, not a technology company. Big tech firms write their own rules and are accountable to themselves alone. This is causing serious issues for you and me as consumers. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have personal experience of how these issues can affect people's lives. For several months in 2020, my husband and I, as well as the charity we founded to help single mothers access education, were the targets of baseless and defamatory accusations made by a conspiracy theorist on Facebook. It was unrelenting for months. Despite originating in New Zealand, the accusations were widely distributed and even reached local networks in my electorate of Mallee. My first thought was for the reputation of an essential charity that young, disadvantaged mothers in my community rely on. I was concerned that the mothers would be driven away from the service, because of these lies, and left even more vulnerable. On top of that, my husband and I were concerned for our safety, and we even installed security cameras at our home, for our peace of mind. It was an incredibly distressing time for my family. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite successive requests to have the damaging content removed, the posts remained public—in some cases for several months—until court proceedings got the attention of Facebook. These legal proceedings have cost us over $150,000 so far, despite a successful court case. The prospect of recouping these losses through the damages that have been awarded is also highly unlikely. Expensive civil proceedings are one of the only means of recourse currently available to people who have been defamed, bullied or harassed online. What concerns me is that many thousands of people who endure bullying and defamation online will lack the means to clear their name or protect their family. Social media enables the tarnishing of reputations and the destruction of lives, with very few avenues for justice. This is untenable, and it must change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are multiple ways these issues need to be addressed, and our government is working to keep Australians safe online. I welcome the strengthening of the role of the eSafety Commissioner and the provision of $39.4 million over the next three years. We're also introducing a new online safety bill. The bill includes a new adult cyber abuse scheme, which would capture abusive behaviour that has reached a criminal threshold. It would provide power for the eSafety Commissioner to direct platforms to remove abusive material within 24 hours. While these are positive measures, I believe further steps need to be taken. Social media platforms need to be held to account as publishers of the content that is hosted on their sites. If a newspaper, radio station or TV channel defamed an individual or incited violence through their publications, they could be sued or prosecuted under the full extent of the Australian law. At this point, the same is not true for Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram and other social media platforms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The business models of social media giants are very similar to those of traditional news media, yet the rules governing print media, radio and television are vastly more proscriptive than those that apply to digital platforms. Traditional news media are held to a much higher standard under the law, which puts them at a commercial disadvantage to digital platforms. This isn't fair, and it doesn't provide for a competitive media industry. Social media giants hide behind the excuse that they are nothing more than a virtual town square and therefore they can't be held responsible for anything that is shouted out. But the fact is that the technology and algorithms that underpin these platforms are incredibly sophisticated. The platforms show you what they think you want to see. They are designed to keep you engaged for as long as possible. These facts alone demonstrate that big tech companies are making editorial decisions regarding the content that you see on their platform. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If big tech companies want to preserve their power to moderate and promote content on their sites, they need to be treated under the same legislative framework as traditional news media and held to account for the consequences of hosting damaging content. In addition, the government should pursue the creation of a public regulatory framework to guide the moderation of content on social media platforms to ensure community expectations around safety and free speech are met. I understand that work is under way to develop a voluntary code along these lines. At the government's direction, DIGI, an association representing the digital platforms industry in Australia, has developed a draft code. The Australian Communications and Media Authority is overseeing the development of the code, and I hope it's found to be sufficient to address the challenges we face regarding disinformation and defamation. Both measures—treating big tech companies as publishers and the introduction of a code of conduct—are essential. Holding big tech companies to account as publishers would provide an incentive for these companies to follow the code of conduct, thereby ensuring the decisions they take to moderate and promote content are in line with community expectations. I know the minister for communications will consider further measures should the voluntary code prove inadequate to address the problems we face.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently the member for Newcastle, Sharon Claydon, and I formed the Parliamentary Friends of Making Social Media Safe group to continue the important discussion around online safety. We are thrilled by the reception of the group so far. Seventy-five members and senators from both sides have joined the group already, which I think displays the interest and concern that so many have regarding social media. One step I've taken in my electorate is to inform young families in particular about dangers online. The internet is not just a harmless space for kids to watch YouTube. Consequently, I've drawn up a handout for the residents of Mallee about the importance of online safety. It's hot off the press and will be sent out this week to all residents in Mallee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The progress made in global communication and interconnectedness, thanks to social media platforms, has been remarkable. With this progress comes a responsibility to ensure that people are safe when using these platforms. I am focused on fighting for change to ensure our kids and grandkids are safe online and that our society has a healthy relationship with social media, going forward.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  This is a serious issue, and I completely understand the member for Mallee bringing this forward. The member for Mallee has been subjected to unacceptable behaviour online. I know what it's like, as a member of parliament myself. When social media started to get its foothold in this country—MPs were using it and in particular where the public was using it—I felt the full force of this unacceptable behaviour, which was particularly focused on my faith. Certain people online used my faith, at various points, to press their case. It's very Islamophobic behaviour that many of us have felt. I know the member for Cowan has gone through the very same thing. In my case, it happened many years ago. The member for Cowan can testify for herself as to what she has been through. It doesn't feel good. You particularly feel it as a member of parliament because you've got a public persona. The people that are close to you feel it, but also the people who are in a similar situation feel it really badly as well. It is not a nice thing to go through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has not just been with some of these forums. It's been going on ever since the first virtual online communities were created, back in the mid-eighties. For example, the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link—WELL, as it was known—was the first of this type of community. Created in the US, it was designed to connect people and, in their view, enable much better ways for people to relate to each other. They thought it would be a positive move. Sure enough, they soon found that it became very problematic. People, for some reason, felt like they had a licence to behave in a way that they would never do if they were physically in the person's presence. In person, they would never say those things to other people in that way and conduct their affairs in that manner. So there is something to be said about going online and treating people in way in which we would not do if we were in their presence. It is an issue, and it's something that we have not really been able to deal with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Mallee referenced some of the legislative things we could do here. In the US, a lot of these firms are given licence to not be held responsible for what appears on their platforms through a thing called section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. So there is an active proposition being chased by some people in the congress, like Mark Warner, to deal with this. But it is a big issue. The thing is, Facebook, Google and Twitter didn't create Islamophobia, homophobia, racism or sexism but they've certainly helped give voice to the legitimacy of the views, and some of the material they've taken off has just been staggering. For example, in the stats for the final quarter of 2018, YouTube removed nearly 19,000 videos and 2,000 channels for violating its hateful or abusive content policy, and in the third quarter of 2018 Facebook took action on nearly three million pieces of content that violated its hate speech policies and 15.4 million pieces of violent and graphic content.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Good on them, because when I raised some of the stuff that occurred previously it took a hell of a long time for anything to happen. I do commend them for taking it, but it has taken a while. A lot of the online platforms have said it's too hard to know what's on their platforms and to deal with. I think a lot of people would believe that is hard to stomach or accept. They do have a capacity to do more, and they should—absolutely—do more. There is still content on pages of these platforms that is absolutely disgusting and should be tackled. Last year, for example, I received a letter from a community organisation that had referenced a University of Victoria report on online Islamophobia and fascism. The report found that although Facebook algorithms were designed to delete posts containing profanities in them they don't necessarily pick up on the insidious nature of some extremist material. That report analysed just over 40,000 posts from 12 far-Right Facebook groups with posts that strongly targeted people on the basis of religion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I haven't heard the government deal with that, not at all. I haven't heard them come in and say it. I respect the member for Mallee has been targeted, but we should not have to wait for action because one government MP was targeted. Lots of people in the community have been targeted by this and we have not seen any action out of the government. Worse still, this parliament held an inquiry into this issue in 2018, into the adequacy of existing offences in the Commonwealth Criminal Code and of state and territory criminal orders to capture cyberbullying. It made a number of recommendations, including: placing regulatory pressure on the platforms, to both prevent and quickly respond to cyberbullying; that the Australian government legislate to create a duty of care, on social media platforms, to ensure safety; that the government increase basic online safety requirements for social media services; and to ensure that the Office of the eSafety Commissioner is adequately resourced to fulfil all its functions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've contacted the committee secretariat and the tabling office on this inquiry. On 28 March it will be three years since this inquiry was tabled with the government, and there's been no response. So we've got this resolution now, we've had all these cases where concerns have been raised, yet nothing has been done by the government. And it's good—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HUSIC:</span>
                  </a>  Exactly. I'll take that interjection from the member for Cowan, because it wasn't them. For ordinary people in the community who are targeted for a whole host of things, in terms of racist and homophobic language, those issues aren't taken seriously. The government has a report on this. They've been asked to deal with it and they don't. This is the real issue: it shouldn't take one government MP to be affected before this—I totally respect and understand how much money the member for Mallee, as she detailed in her contribution, undertook. She should not have to go—no-one should have to pay $100,000-plus on legal fees to deal with this. It should be taken seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is it's not just the platforms where this has become an issue. The platforms give a space for this to rise. What I want to know from the government too is why don't they take this stuff seriously at its source, not just the platform but at its source? How come, whenever we have raised the issue of far Right extremism, which has driven a lot of bad behaviour online, it has taken ages for it to be responded to?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We only got an inquiry into far Right extremism when the government were happy that it didn't just target far Right extremism and didn't mention it. It could only be referenced as 'extremism'. Yet we've been saying for ages that this is an issue. The agencies have said, 'This is a problem.' They are concerned about word transforming into deed and impacting on people's safety, and we've had no serious commitment out of those opposite as a government. A responsible government would take this seriously. They would absolutely treat this seriously. They would go to the source, not just to the platform that creates the environment for this hateful stuff to be said. They don't take it seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government were serious not only would they respond to reports saying, 'Treat cyberbullying, hate speech and this terrible online behaviour seriously,' and deal with that but they would also treat seriously this issue of far Right extremism. I don't care if it is an Islamist or a far Right extremist; anyone who threatens the Australian public should be dealt with forcefully. But it seems to me that it takes a hell of a long time to deal with far Right extremism. With Islamists we've seen proscription of groups. We've seen a hell of a lot of action on banning groups that don't even operate here if they're Islamist. But, if they're far Right, it takes a hell of a long time for anything to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister here is getting uptight about it. But do you know what makes me uptight? I don't like it when I see people using Nazi salutes in protests in Melbourne. I don't like it when I see swastikas being held up in people's homes. I don't like it when we hear of those groups collecting ammunition and weaponry. And I don't like it when we have a government minister in the form of the home affairs minister who cannot mention far Right extremism without having to also reference Antifa, as if you can only acknowledge it if it is balanced out that way. It's wrong. People deserve to have their safety taken seriously. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

However, there needs to be a line drawn when it comes to issues that pertain to safety and there has to be a reasonable discussion about a level of accountability that has to be taken by social media companies as publishers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Social media is so powerful and is such an opportunity for us to stay connected, particularly during this time of COVID when we were physically separated. It has been so odd. But with great power, as the saying goes, comes great responsibility. Right now, these social media companies are taking no responsibility over the platforms that they have created and are being used for these purposes. The attitudes of Australians are changing. When social media started, the attitude of Australians was that they were willing to accept a lot of downsides for this amazing connectivity that was created. But Australians are now realising—and in my electorate I talk to people who see it all the time—that they don't have to accept this anonymous rubbish that's being hosted by social media. They do not have to accept as a trade-off for connectivity that their kids can be groomed online and that it's so hard to police. They don't have to accept that people will say things on social media that they would never say to your face or act in a way that they would never act in real life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Commercial television broadcasters operate according to the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice, developed by the industry. But social media has no such code. Frankly, we need to move faster to level the playing field with social media companies. As the member for Mallee said, social media companies need to be regulated as publishers. If they host material on this platform then people need to be able to pursue damages against them, just like in the non-digital world. It's not that much to ask. It's just that the same rules that are in the real world should also apply in the digital world. It's not difficult. These social media companies have enormous resources. The opportunity is there where, if somebody sees anonymous content hosted that they feel is defamatory, harmful or something like that, they should be able to tell Facebook or one of these other social media giants, and there should be an expectation that, if they don't remove it within 24 or 48 hours, they are agreeing to publish it and they can be held responsible as a publisher for the negative effect that it has. They have that responsibility as traditional publishers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most worrying use of all social media is obviously in the context of the incitement of violence, child exploitation and child sexual abuse material. As a young dad, I'm obviously very passionate about preventing this. I recently visited the ACCCE centre in Brisbane, established by this government to counter child exploitation. One of the things that was raised with me by the incredibly dedicated individuals that are there trying to track down this material is the barrier that social media platforms create when trying to find, stop and prosecute these vile individuals. Did you know that Facebook and these other social media giants are objecting to one in every five lawful requests that our law agencies make to have access to individuals who are grooming or posting child exploitation material online? Just think about that: 20 per cent of lawful requests from our law agencies to these social media publishers to access the details of these people who are committing the most heinous crimes are rejected. What possible excuse could there be for that? It's simply not enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is acutely aware of this. It is doing an enormous amount in terms of Minister Fletcher's online safety bill and in terms of resourcing the eSafety Commissioner, which was never there before. But we have more to do, and we need to hold these social media companies to account as the publishers they are.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  I'm very pleased to make a contribution to the debate today on the wide range of threats that are being enabled by social media platforms: threats to individuals, threats to communities and, indeed, threats to the very fabric of democratic systems like ours. I thank the member for Mallee for raising this important issue today and I thank her for reaching out to me to establish the bipartisan group of Parliamentary Friends of Making Social Media Safe, a group designed to put these issues very firmly on the national agenda. We will be launching the Parliamentary Friends of Making Social Media Safe next Tuesday with a breakfast in the Mural Hall, and I encourage all members to come along and join in the discussion on this important issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Upfront, I would like to recognise that social media has given us some very positive things and enriched our lives in ways that we couldn't previously have imagined. Through it we have found lost friends, fostered new connections and shared knowledge, free of many of the constraints that exist in the physical world. Indeed, in these COVID times, it has helped bridge the tyranny of distance for many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this remarkable reach and ubiquity also has a darker side because it also created fertile ground for some serious threats to flourish: for individuals to be defamed and their reputations sullied; for vulnerable people to be bullied, harassed and exploited; for coercive control to be utilised to instil fear in women; for entire communities to be maligned, victimised or persecuted; for the amplification of hate speech from far-Right extremist groups; for the glorification and incitement of violence; for dangerous misinformation to spread like wildfire; and for democratic processes to be undermined and subverted. These things matter and these threats are real, but at the moment there are precious few avenues for redress when people have been wronged. For their part, the social media companies often behave like outlaws in the new digital Wild West: answerable to no-one and not responsible for so many of the harms they are enabling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These platforms can and do moderate content on their sites, so we've moved well beyond the idea that they are merely passive, neutral conduits of information. But they have set themselves up as global entities, effectively, outside all jurisdictions, dodging scrutiny and accountability all too often, and we've seen the ills that have resulted. Enough is enough. Social media companies need to take responsibility for what their platforms have unleashed. They are well resourced and they have an obligation to the communities they currently exploit for profit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, government has a responsibility too. The current hotchpotch of laws and self-regulation clearly is not enough, and indeed dominant platforms have even gone so far as to call for governments to regulate them properly. So what is taking this government so long? Frankly, the regulatory environment is a mess. The Morrison government talks a lot about the online safety act, but the fact is that that act still does not exist, despite all the talk. Similarly, the disinformation code still isn't in place, and I fear it won't do nearly enough, given that it's only voluntary and doesn't address misinformation as the regulator said it must. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, along with all of my colleagues on this side, welcome the eSafety commissioner and some additional resourcing that has gone to her, but let's not underestimate the enormity of her task. We know that recent global studies have shown that social media is the new frontier for gendered violence and we have witnessed the rapid escalation of it during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is chilling to say the very least and should ring alarm bells for everybody in this House. Some 65 per cent of girls and young women surveyed in Australia have been harassed on social media. If that is not pause for thought, I'm not sure what is. But, given the incredible reach of social media, there is a lot of work to do. I thank the member for Mallee for bringing this forward. It's just the start.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  I don't think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies only judge to be 100 per cent true. I believe we should err on the side of greater expression. They're not my words; they're the words of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg from 2019. Moreover, he went on to say this little gem in a speech in front of Georgetown University students in 2019: 'I don't think it's right for a private company to censor politicians.' We had Jack Dorsey of Twitter, tweeting out to us that 'Twitter stands for freedom of expression'—that was in 2015. Oh how times have changed where we now have these big tech social media conglomerates that are censoring political speech all over their platforms. I for one do not think that is right. It is an attack on democracy itself. It is an attack on free speech. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you can censor and deplatform the leader of the Free World, you can do it to anyone. There's an old saying, 'Whoever takes down the king, becomes the king.' These social media giants, these big tech corporations, are now way, way too powerful. They control the new town square, the new public forum, where political discussion, all sorts of discussion, goes on. Of course we should clamp down on speech that is harmful, defamatory, and illegal, and where the content is actual hate speech—not just speech that we hate, but actual hate speech; there is a difference. We should clamp down on all of those things that would not be allowed in a newspaper. But the problem is these big tech companies have gone far too far. They now are clamping down on political discussion, political commentary, political views, and they're also putting in these so-called fact checkers who give the impression that a fact you have posted is wrong when it is a fact and it is correct. They do that by saying it's missing context. Tell me which news story isn't missing some form of context! So this is a very, very big problem for democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike other speakers in this place, I do not wish to further censor these big tech companies. I do not wish to censor what people are saying on social media platforms. But I will concede this: they're actually now no longer platforms; they're publications. They're censoring speech that is lawful on what were once platforms and are now basically online publications. That is why, if these big tech companies don't bring themselves back to the point of being social media free speech platforms, as they were originally intended, then they probably should, as the member for Mallee has suggested, be liable for defamation. They've basically become publications now, publications which have editorial guidelines—they call them community standards, but now they're basically editorial guidelines. They're major publications which have a whole heap of volunteer contributors. If that's the model that they want, then that is what they're going to have to live with, and defamation and their liability for defamation are going to have to be part of their business as usual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish though that they would just go back to what they were originally intended to be: platforms for free expression. I don't think we're going to see that, but I've got to say that, whether we make these social media giants go back to being platforms or whether we say, 'You're now acting like publications and so you should be liable for defamation,' they should be the focus of government. We shouldn't simply have legislation which makes these big tech companies pay big news companies. I don't want to see big tech corporations paying big news media corporations. What I want to see is legislation here protecting the little guy, protecting the average Australian, and that is what this motion is calling for.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue and support the comments made by my colleagues the member for Chifley and the member for Newcastle. I really want to speak about the challenges faced by small-business women as they conduct their business online, especially on social media. Prior to COVID, many actively avoided social media for business purposes, but no-one could help but get online during COVID. What this has led to is a rise in anxiety about what comments will be made about them or their business or their competitors or their customers as the social media tragics target them. All of us as MPs would be well aware of the tactics—people hiding behind sometimes numerous fake Facebook profiles, sometimes using their own name but not often; comments appearing in the late hours of the night or the early hours of the morning, never alone but always with a couple of others happy to pile in, at a time when they know neither we nor our staff can monitor. Their skill is in inciting others to engage and respond to their nonsense. Some people just can't help themselves. As MPs, we recognise we'll be targets, and I know we do our best to deal with those comments, many of which I now take a hard line on and choose to delete or hide because I want people to feel they can have a rigorous but respectful discussion around policy on my page. But it is hard to get to them all. That's us with our resources. What worries me is that small and micro businesses are really feeling the pain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've discussed this with members of women's business groups, and the level of anxiety about how to deal with it is through the roof. Some have reported being afraid to post in groups for fear of the response it will trigger. Others are concerned that conversations on their page can quickly escalate way beyond the original topic and they're just not sure how to manage it. The eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, released a report nearly a year ago showing a 40 per cent increase in reports of online abuse and cyberbullying in just the first few weeks of COVID compared with the previous 12-month weekly average. The commissioner has said she believes the increase in online harm is unlikely to go away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me it feels like a full-time job keeping on top of it, but for small business this is not something they should have to put up with. I'm not waiting for legislation to support these women in business in coping with the onslaught. It is a wait, by the way. The government promised to bring in legislation last year, but instead, two days before Christmas, they released a draft—two days before Christmas. It was almost as if they didn't really want feedback on it. The submissions closed on Valentine's Day. If anyone in my electorate missed out on putting in a submission, please send it to me, and I will make sure it gets to the minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The draft legislation provides the eSafety Commissioner with some additional powers to unmask internet trolls, but, as I said, I am not waiting for this government to legislate, because we've waited far too long. Working with the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, I'm running a workshop next month to empower women in business in my electorate to deal with cyberabuse and cyberanxiety. As Ms Inman Grant has said to me, 'The gendered nature of online abuse is an issue we've been grappling with for some time.' She's expanded the Women Influencing Tech Spaces program to offer in-depth social media self-defence as a way of tackling this issue head-on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased to be joining with the Office of the eSafety Commissioner to provide advice and practical support for women in business in my electorate, for whom social media is a vital professional tool. I'm partnering with Women with Altitude and the Hawkesbury Women in Business group, with invitations to go out through the chambers of commerce. It's open to all women in business across the electorate of Macquarie through the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury. This is something I hope will help women be better prepared to recognise online harassment and cyberabuse; to know where and to whom and when to report it; to help them make decisions about whether to respond and the best ways to do that; and to be aware about how online harassment can affect wellbeing. This will be a really practical forum with practical advice and an opportunity to discuss the things that I know women in micro and small business are dealing with every single day. The online workshop will be from 6 pm on Tuesday 9 March, and all of the details and RSVP links will, appropriately, be on Facebook. So look out for it. I urge women to join us. We should be using social media as a tool that lifts up the businesses that we work in and get one step in front of the people who are trying to pull us down, and that's what this workshop is aimed at.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This time last year, I made the observation that on this one significant day in February each year many fine speeches have been given in this chamber. As we mark the anniversary of the Apology to the Stolen Generations by vowing to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia, we have heard words that lifted us all—none finer, of course, than Kevin Rudd's 13 years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I also warned that, if this day were to become little more than a ceremony of renewal of good intentions, that would be so far short of what it should be, of what we have to be. We cannot allow ourselves to become content with just words, as important as words can be. Fine oratory with nothing attached to it in the end amounts to nothing more than a beautifully worded indictment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year's Closing the Gap targets have not been backed with new investments in housing, services or programs. This year, we gather with an even greater absence. For the first time, the annual report card for Closing the Gap has been pushed back. A government that has perfected the art of nondelivery has found one more way to outdo itself—a government that shuts down debate in this parliament regularly. Today we are left with the anniversary of an event that was meant to be the start of something else. As Prime Minister Rudd reflected:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The apology was unfinished business for our nation. It is the beginning of new business for our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But how do we move forward when we have a government so determined to stand still?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In last year's <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report only two of seven targets were on track: early childhood education and year 12 attainment. None of the other targets—child mortality; reading, writing and numeracy; school attendance; employment; and life expectancy—were on track. This of course is not in the spirit of the apology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be forever humbled by the grace of so many stolen generations members in their willingness that day to take the hand so belatedly extended to them. It is that grace that lights the path ahead—a path that we must have the courage to take. We must take the first step, then follow it with another and another and another. Instead, we have a government that is not moving and a list of challenges that grows longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has provisioned $160 million for a referendum, but the Prime Minister has refused to commit to any time line for holding one. Since the Press Club address way back in 2019, after the election, in which Minister Wyatt clearly promised a referendum this term, he has repeatedly dismissed the prospect of one in the near future, arguing that he does not think it will succeed at this time. If a fear of failure is your guiding light, you need never fear success. The government has also refused to commit to a voice to parliament and refers instead to a voice to government—two very different things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is never any sense of urgency with this government. It is a government defined by inaction and the exhaustion of a government that has been in power so long that whatever energies it once possessed are long since spent. It is not for nothing that my good friend the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, has warned of the danger that the Uluru statement could end up being remembered as a noble moment but not as a turning point. We must do better—all of us. Let us take the steps that are demanded of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very early in the life of this parliament—indeed, in the first meeting I had with the Prime Minister—I extended the hand of bipartisanship to him to work together for progress for First Australians. We held a meeting, but there hasn't been further meaningful engagement. Progress on human rights does take time. It is not the sort of thing that can be achieved with a couple of photo-ops. I again offer to work together, and I urge the Prime Minister to take this offer as it is intended—a genuine attempt to produce outcomes we can all be proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should keep turning back to the words of the great Galarrwuy Yunupingu: 'At Uluru we started a fire, a fire that we hope burns bright for Australia.' Let that hope not be in vain.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  I rise today in this auspicious meeting place as a representative of the north-west, the west coast and King Island in the electorate of Braddon in Tasmania. I do this alongside the 150 representatives from regions right across the nation. This is a level playing field; the very layout of this chamber embellishes that. It's a circle. It represents that everybody in this place has an equal voice and, importantly, an equal right to be heard. That is a crucial part of our democracy. My role in this place is to represent every man, woman and child in my electorate. It is their voices that I strive to bring to this place, not necessarily my own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking about closing the gap, I have sought wise counsel from those within my electorate. Amongst the people that I spoke to was a young Aboriginal leader, a leader in our region, and one with a true voice for Indigenous peoples. When I spoke with her yesterday, she said that she was in another meeting place, in an ancient land, a rugged land, where waves were crashing in against the rocks, at Bluff Point on the west coast of Tasmania. For 60,000 years it has been a sacred meeting place. She gave me her wise counsel, speaking from the generations that have gone before her and with a clear and genuine view for the future that lies ahead. Her name is Emma Lee. I regard her as my sister and I rate her most definitely as a true leader.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, in this place of voices, she has leant me her voice, without agenda, in a desire to find a better pathway forward for all Tasmanians, to move towards a brighter future for us all. She gave me a very clear message, and it gives me great pride to present that message in this place to the nation. 'Ya' is the Palawa word for 'hello', and that is how a message begins. She says: 'Ya. As Indigenous peoples, we do not have a formal right or a formal say over our own affairs and, as a proud Aboriginal Tasmanian woman, I am diminished by it. I want to make a positive difference for all Tasmanians, because my cultural obligation is to welcome people to country and to care for them. If I cannot provide the advice that looks after everyone together, then how are Australian people meant to know that they too belong to us and they too share in the oldest living culture in the world?' Emma says: 'Ya. I want to make everyone welcome freely in my country with respect so that we can live and work peacefully together. The Indigenous voice will help us make a difference so that people are not lonely anymore and so that they have a connection to country and to Australia itself. I want a hand up so that you can hear me, not a hand down that speaks on my behalf. I want to belong to you so that you can belong to me and we can belong to the oldest living culture in the world. If we welcome each other in government in parliament, we can become equal in how we care for country. I want to share our culture with everyone, and I want to stop hurting, because our peoples are not allowed to have a proper say in our lives. This government can make a difference with the Indigenous voice for this place.' To my dear friend Dr Emma Lee, I deliver your message to this place and to a nation. It would do us all to take note of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has to work to do more to ensure that Indigenous advice is formally included in all process and that we are open to other parts of the Australian community. We have made a great start in the national agreement on closing the gap to ensure Indigenous organisations have a greater say in funding outcomes. It's important that we continue to build on that goodwill. The voice means that many close the gap targets will have a greater chance of succeeding, because we are now working together, as it should be, to hear from all Australians in a process that is equal for all. That must be our goal, and I am proud to support the government's policy to create that pathway so that we can stand together on issues that are important to us all as Australians.</span>

It recognises that 13 years ago the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, made a very long-awaited National Apology to the Stolen Generations on behalf of the nation. It was one of the first items of business of the newly elected Labor government. The landmark inquiry into the stolen generations, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report<span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> had been launched a decade before. For 11 long years those taken, and in fact the whole nation, waited for the words 'we are sorry'. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report had 54 recommendations. This included that Australian governments acknowledge and apologise for the policies of forced removal. The recommendations included the Indigenous Child Placement Principle—the notion that, when an Indigenous child must be removed, they be placed with a family member, a member of the child's community or another Indigenous carer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the recommendations that are important about this report. It drew a line in the sand for us as a nation. No-one could ever say again, 'We didn't know.' It represented an important act of truth-telling. There were many thousands of people who survived and were able to tell their stories for those of us who remained. Of course, the Archie Roach song 'Took the Children Away' says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion emphasises the importance of closing the gap and a commitment to, in fact, bring about justice and equity for First Peoples in Australia. Good words are only truly meaningful when they are accompanied with sincere deeds and lasting progress. This is the first year since the apology that we will not get a report from the Prime Minister on progress, or lack of progress, on the targets. What concerns me is that, after a decade, progress against the seven targets in 2020 was dismal reading, as the member for Grayndler outlined. At the conclusion of those seven targets, only two were on track. Child mortality; reading, writing and numeracy; school attendance; employment outcomes; and life expectancy—all not on track. These aren't just statistics; they are lives. I'm sick of going to the funerals of people who have died too young. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Agreement on Closing the Gap is indeed welcome. It is welcome especially because of the partnership with the coalition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peak organisations. This is a good thing. There are 16 new targets, with two still being negotiated. States and territories will have to report, as well as the Commonwealth. Labor in principle endorsed the new targets—in particular, the targets about the overrepresentation of First Australians in the child protection system as well as the criminal justice system, two targets that Labor had been advocating for for many years. The time frame for these targets is another 10 years. This means that, on the expiration of the new targets, over two decades will have passed since Closing the Gap first began—23 years, a whole generation. I say to this parliament: that is a very long time, so it is important that we get this right this time. We must not allow this decade-long time frame to become the impetus for kicking the burden of progress to future parliaments </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to see real and lasting progress on Closing the Gap, we need new investment. The Commonwealth government must fully embrace its share of the new Closing the Gap agreement, not simply wash its hands of responsibility and pass it to the states and territories. The First Nations people need to be placed at the centre of decision-making on issues affecting First Nations people. We are best placed to find the solutions on issues that affect us. Labor remains committed to the Uluru statement in full. This includes the constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament, a voice that reflects the diversity of challenges that we face across the nation, a voice that listens to our regions and remote communities as well as our urban areas. It's been 3½ years since the Uluru statement. It's time to get on with it and get it done.</span>

                  <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I welcome this motion put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. It does give us a chance to talk about a very important issue. Eight per cent or thereabouts of my electorate of Grey is Indigenous, and I have made it a core part of my workload, since I came to this place, to try and bring about a better outcome for them and their families. I note the comments of the Leader of the Opposition. Quite rightly, he raises the issue that only two of the components of Closing the Gap were met last year. But, in doing so, he also indicated that maybe he doesn't have a full grasp of the issues facing us, because he said, 'It's not good enough; it should be fixed.' If it were easy to fix, it would have been fixed long ago. The fact of the matter is that these are deep, multilayered and complex issues. The reasons that Indigenous Australia has not met the societal and health levels of the rest of Australia are complex, and it is not through lack of trying on the part of the government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased that last year the agreement was reached with the state bodies to form a joint commitment to Closing the Gap. It makes sense, because issues of housing, education and policing, for instance, are primarily the responsibilities of the states. It's not to say that the federal government may not contribute to these financially, but we don't run them. On the other hand, the issues of health care and income support are primarily the Commonwealth government's, even though the state may employ some of the workers. So it makes sense. If we are to make commitments in this place, we need those rock-solid commitments at state level. I was very pleased we reached that point of view.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through my 13 years in parliament, I have come to realise there's a large difference between urbanised Indigenous Australia and remote Indigenous Australia. The key issue here, I think, is English as a first language. Where I see English as a second language, I see a disconnect on so many levels and the struggle to reach attainment in education. We've run programs. The school attendance program is a good program. It works when you've got an inspired leader on the ground and an engaged school principal. If you haven't got both of those, it doesn't work; it falls away quickly. Quite often the leader of the program is the most talented person in the community and they get poached into another program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that is a bit of an aside. The Productivity Commission estimates that we spend around $44,000 a head per year on Indigenous Australia. We can't really get a precise handle on it, but it is closer to $250,000 a head in remote communities like the APY lands in my electorate. I don't bark about the money. We've got inequity there and we have to try and face it and we have to try and find answers. But it just shows that these answers are not easy. But I don't think it can be claimed that there is a lack of interest in it. It should be producing better results. In my time, there has been an improvement in the physical infrastructure. The housing is better but we could do with more quality housing. The shops are definitely better. The health facilities are better, and the school facilities. You would be pleased to send your children to any one of those things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the outcomes are just not matching the investment, and with everything we do in this space it is reasonable to ask why that is not the case. Jacinta Price, from the Centre for Independent studies, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The chasm shows in shocking statistics for health and reduced life expectancy, school truancy, subsequent poor education and employment levels, and the horrendous impact of high crime rates, particularly domestic violence and sexual assault.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a very concerning statement. I know it is true. Most of us who have anything to do with this space know it is true. We are intent on closing the gap but we cannot do it on our own. We need motivation on the ground from parents to make sure their children get to school. I don't know how we do that. We try multiple approaches to bridge this gap. But I will just make the point that this government is committed. I am the representative in this place of the eight per cent of my electorate who are Indigenous. I feel as though we make a fair-dinkum effort. But do we have all the answers? Absolutely not. We need to recommit and we need to re-examine daily what we do in this space.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="IJ4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  When Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered the Apology to the Stolen Generations 13 years ago it was seen as a significant milestone in the nation's coming to terms with a sorry past. Out of the apology grew the hope and the expectation that we could now move forward and make change, that there would be a new relationship between First Australians and the rest of the nation. During the course of his contribution, Mr Rudd said that the core of this partnership for the future was closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians on life expectancy, educational achievement and employment opportunities. Out of that grew the COAG agreement in 2008 for the Closing the Gap targets. There were six targets: to close the life expectancy gap within a generation; to halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five within a decade; to ensure access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities within five years; to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for children within a decade; to halve the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 attainment by 2020; and to halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a decade. As we know from the report of last year, we've failed dismally on all but two of those targets—sadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is no report to be tabled today. As the shadow minister said, that will now be put off until 7 August to reflect the agreement between the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and the Coalition of the Peaks with a set of new targets. What that does is break the nexus between the apology and the Closing the gap report. I think it's a way of diminishing the importance of the apology. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Significantly, through the 13 years since the apology, issues for the stolen generation still remain. There has been no compensation scheme for members of the stolen generation who are in the care of the Commonwealth, and there must be. It is a simple matter of justice, of what is right. I'm pleased to say I'm very proud that the Labor Party took to the last election a policy to provide such compensation. As we reflect on the lack of achievement since 2008, is it any wonder that First Nations people were driven to meet at Uluru and together produce the Statement from the Heart? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the fine words of Prime Minister Rudd, the high and noble sentiments, but, sadly, little has been achieved against those magnificent aspirations. Are we now at risk of another stolen generation? Twenty-four years after the <span style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ringing them home </span>report, First Nations children are nearly 10 times more likely to be living in out-of-home care in Australia. More than 20,000 First Nations children are in out-of-home care; that's about 30 per cent of the total number of children in out-of-home care, yet First Nations children represent only six per cent of the child population. As shocking as these figures are, they are getting worse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely, we are better than this. What is it that prevents this nation from truly coming to terms with our past and, finally, acknowledging and dealing with the demands and aspirations of First Nations peoples in a mature and just way? Surely, we have an obligation to accede to the request for a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament, truth-telling and a makarrata. It is now past time we allowed our own obduracy and obstinacy to get in the way of simply doing what is right. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the course of the Rudd and Gillard governments, I had the great privilege of being the Minister for Indigenous Health. At that the time we developed in partnership with Aboriginal communities across Australia the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan 2013-23. After we lost government in 2013, there was an expectation and bipartisan support that this plan would be used going forward by the government to be the framework within which its Aboriginal affairs health policy would be developed. Sadly, it appears not to have been the case. There has been no properly funded implementation strategy. There is now negotiation of a new plan, yet there's been no evaluation of the outcomes from the original plan that I'm aware of. Is that an indication of how sincere successive governments from the coalition have been in addressing the issues so readily and properly identified in the first Closing the Gap statement to the parliament by Prime Minister Rudd in 2008? I fear not.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0H" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  I welcome this important debate today as we consider the Closing the Gap targets revised last year. We would all agree that this is about healthy and economically independent Indigenous Australian families; meeting not just Australian targets but global targets; quoting not just national averages but breaking these gaps down into local government areas, regional and remote areas and by community; and making closure of these gaps the first order of business in everything we do where Indigenous Australians have a stake. Ultimately, there has to be an Indigenous private sector thriving in every corner of this land, services delivered by Indigenous Australians to the rest of the nation and thinking way beyond that the only good that can be created is dot paintings and the only service delivered being a tourism operator or a ranger. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three hard questions that we've completely missed with these 16 targets, and it gives me great pain to point these out. But none of these targets can be met. There's no guarantee we won't have another decade of failure until we answer these three questions. The first of those is: are we prepared as a nation to have the hard conversation around empowering Indigenous men and women to lead their own communities and not have it corroded from beneath by individual welfare payments imposed as a Western model nor large payments into communities where families in an internecine way are turned upon each other? This is about allowing senior men and women not just to lead but to have the power to. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once they lead, I trust they can achieve a second of these practical goals—that is, owning education. It's not just getting enrolled in education, it's not just the education certificate; it's the outcome, not an administrative output, that matters. Where there are Indigenous Australians there must be an Indigenous say in the curriculum, the syllabus, the bilingual nature of education, complete ownership of the successes and the failures, because Indigenous education is not something that should be done to them. Once you have empowered elders and they own education, they can engage the economy. This is not just about employment anymore. What we've created is, basically, a single-pass vortex of welfare money in, leaving in the first pass straight out in non-Indigenous manufactured goods or, as they call it out there, crap—excuse the vernacular. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no service economy of note. Healthy economies around the world have a fifth of their population in the public service, a fifth of their government spend in public services, not 100 per cent. Until we fix up this absolutely obvious distortion of Indigenous Australia, created by non-Indigenous Australia, you can't begin to hope for a thriving services sector that creates non-government employment. For those reasons, I have to finish by saying what the five great inadequacies in the targets we've just adopted are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In education target No. 3 we can't just look at school enrolments, we need to look at where it goes. It's about completion of school and the academic goals that have been achieved while at school. The 55 per cent school potential target No. 5, for the AEDC, is unacceptably low and it must be closer to 100 per cent. If we don't have children achieving these domains in the AEDC we cannot achieve targets 5 and 6. In target 7 economic engagement has to be 100 per cent, by definition. If we accept 67 per cent, we allow one in three to wash through the system as disengaged. That doesn't work in the rest of the world, let alone Australia. In employment goal 8, it's split employment into public and private, because private employment is just as important, and that gap needs to close. We simply can't employ every Indigenous Australian in the government and call it a success. While the quantum of housing in goal 9 is important, we need sustainably managed and maintained housing, where the resident can pay the rent out of private income. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in criminal justice targets 10 and 11 the rate of Indigenous offending is what matters, not the incarceration—that's just an administrative output by the judge. We've got to stop the offending; that's the goal that needs to be closed. We need to report all interpersonal violence, not just that against women and children. However important that is, we need the entire violence gap closed. It may not start against women and children, and we need to be measuring that too. These are highly emotional topics, and every Australian needs to be united in engaging them.</span>

I acknowledge the Ngunawal and Ngambri people whose land on which the parliament meets, and I acknowledge the Tharawal, Gundungurra and Dharug people, the traditional owners in the electorate of Werriwa. Acknowledging First Australians and recognising them as the true owners of the land is a small but powerful message. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognition is the first step to reconciliation, as is truth-telling, and I add my voice to acknowledge elders past, present and emerging. But there is much more that needs to be done, and Labor will always be committed to bringing justice to all Indigenous communities. It was a Labor government that made the national Apology to the Stolen Generations on behalf of all Australians. It was a Labor government that acknowledges an apology is tremendously essential; however, it doesn't close the gap. There needs to be structural, institutional and cultural change in Australia for First Nations people to have the same opportunities as all Australians. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday I attended the Memories in the Mall event in Liverpool that marks the importance of the apology for our community. It is the importance to remember and to recommit to make a difference. The Liverpool council and our community have a respectful relationship with its Aboriginal residents. Recently, there was a deed of agreement between Gandangara Local Aboriginal Land Council and Liverpool council for the upgrade of Apex and Phillips parks. The agreement will ensure that the Aboriginal community have their history and culture recognised. There will be employment opportunities, traineeships, apprenticeships and an Indigenous garden. These are tangible opportunities for change. Also as part of the celebrations for the 200th anniversary of Campbelltown City, the council, with the input of its First People, has built a Campbelltown yarning circle. Opened earlier this year by the Mayor of Campbelltown, the yarning circle is a show of commitment to supporting and respecting the original inhabitants of Campbelltown, the Dharawal. I would like to make special mention of Uncle Ivan Wellington, who was pivotal in seeing this project come to fruition and spoke at the unveiling. Uncle Ivan spoke about the great benefits the site will bring not only to the local Indigenous community but to the wider community as a whole. Our local community is showing that it can work to improve the situation for Aboriginal residents, but more needs to be done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's my great privilege to be part of the Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs. This committee recently handed down its report on food security in remote communities. Food security in these areas has a disproportional effect on Aboriginal Australians. The most distressing evidence about the lack of reliable food chains and supplies came from an Aboriginal elder in a remote community, who told us that she fully expected her children would be hungry for at least three months a year because of the lack of deliveries during the wet season. This wasn't just the result of the pandemic; it happened every year. This is heartbreaking. In 2021, it is unacceptable and intolerable for a country like ours. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For more than a decade, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report recommendations have highlighted what needs to be achieved to improve the lives of First Nations people. It is disappointing that many of the recommendations have not been implemented and the targets are still not on track. Child mortality rates in Indigenous communities have stagnated for the last decade, sitting well above the targets set. Tragically, 117 Indigenous children died in 2018, more than double that of the rate for non-Indigenous children. Sadly, while the rate of non-Indigenous child mortality is improving at a faster rate, the gap is widening for Aboriginal children. But, as the member for Barton said, these are people, not statistics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More needs to be done to understand the health and social detriments of Indigenous mothers and children if birth outcomes and mortality rates are to improve. First Nations people are dying too soon. They are incarcerated too often, suffer from more preventable diseases, are educated less and are the least likely to be employed. The statistics from the report do not do real justice to the situation that our First Nations peoples face every day. This is a tragedy not of their own making. We must act. We must end the shameful history and use the figures that we have to change the lives for emerging generations. And we must do it now.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  They say that the definition of stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. And yet, in the Closing the Gap policy area, that is what we have been doing for more than a decade. The original <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the Gap</span> report started with the noble aims of the then Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Tom Calma, to set targets and report back in this place each and every year. Five prime ministers and opposition leaders have made beautiful and passionate speeches on this topic, some of the most beautiful and passionate speeches ever delivered in this place. I remember Prime Minister Morrison's speech last year, where he illustrated the old thinking of control, which governments have exercised over the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples for generations. He movingly read from the archival file of what was then called the Department of Native Welfare. He told to the House the story of a young boy, referred to in a patronising way as 'a good type of lad', asking for 75c more pocket money. Powerfully, the Prime Minister then revealed that this same person was today the Minister for Indigenous Australians. What an interesting and powerful illustration of the old thinking. But, despite the fact that those sentiments were written in the 1960s, the old thinking has continued to pervade these areas of policy, and, because of the old thinking, we haven't been able to shift the dial on the Closing the Gap targets anywhere near as much as we would have liked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, two of the seven targets were on track: to halve the gap in year 12 attainment and to have 95 per cent of Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025. But halving the gap in child mortality, school attendance, child literacy and numeracy, and employment, and closing the gap in life expectancy within a generation were not on target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those days of control should be well and truly behind us. That is why what the federal government has done—in partnership with the states, territories, and local government and, most importantly, the Coalition of Peaks—has been a complete change in the way in which we approach the Closing the Gap targets. For the first time, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have not just been the subject of the Closing the Gap targets but they have set the targets themselves in conglomeration and in cooperation with the states, the territories and the Commonwealth. This is so important for two reasons. As I began to do more work in the Indigenous policy space and as somebody who became interested in this space because of my interest in constitutional law, it surprised me that, despite the fact that in 1967 Australians overwhelmingly voted to give the Commonwealth power to make laws with relation to Indigenous people, most of the policies and laws that affect their everyday lives are made at the state, territory and local levels. Yet the old thinking left the entire responsibility for closing the gap in the hands of the Commonwealth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This new refresh of the Closing the Gap targets brings people together, including Commonwealth and state governments but most importantly the Aboriginal community-controlled sector. I want to pay tribute to the distinguished, tenacious Aboriginal leader Pat Turner, who is in the gallery today, who led the 51 Coalition of Peaks organisations to put together proposals to change these targets so that they had the buy-in of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and, importantly, the buy-in of the states and territories. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">New targets don't mean easier targets. In fact, many of these targets are hugely ambitious. But you would not want anything less than hugely ambitious targets, many of which are to be achieved in the next decade, when we are talking about improving the lives of and improving outcomes for our First Australians. What we've done in bringing the Coalition of Peaks together to help design and implement the new Closing the Gap targets is give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a say, for the first time in their history, over the policies, laws and programs that affect them. This is truly a watershed moment in the history of our country and in the history of black and white relations in our country. It's important that this is not a Canberra-knows-best idea or a state-and-territory-governments-know-best idea but that this is truly a partnership between the Commonwealth, the states, local government and, importantly, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who are delivering the services, who are a part of the community, who have the capacity and the accountability to the local communities to change lives on the ground. I believe that this is a really important year in closing the gap.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:58</span>):  I rise to speak on what is an incredibly important day for Australia and for all Australians. Australians need to have a strong sense of peace about our past, and that includes understanding, embracing and caring about our Indigenous people. The First Nations people have been an important and essential part of our culture and our heritage. But closing the gap remains a part of our Australian community which is something we need to address. What I would say about closing the gap is when I went to Arnhem Land nearly 30 years ago to see for myself how the Indigenous population was dealing with what is a very difficult situation, I was absolutely appalled by some of the health inequities that I was seeing. It's sad to say that many of those health inequities remain. Unfortunately, the gap in mortality rates between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples remains extreme. Unfortunately, we have some problems that are persisting: health, education, jobs. We need to do more. Today is about making practical measures in order to improve the outcomes for Indigenous people. </span>

I honour the Minister for Indigenous Australians and the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, both of whom are making history in this House.

In all of us, the loves, losses and traumas of our past live on in us. They linger, they have their own life, and they are passed on.

                <span class="HPS-Small">True reconciliation … is not achievable in the absence of acknowledgment by the nation of the wrongfulness of the past dispossession, oppression and degradation of the Aboriginal peoples.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier today, I found some quiet time to reread parts of <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span>. Children forcibly removed from parents; mothers chasing after police cars that had taken their children; siblings separated; adoptions without consent; forced servitude; welfare institutions were cruel, devoid of warmth, love or care; parents searching for lost children; grief, trauma, endless pain that cascaded through generations—all actioned by the state, a state that seized absolute control over Aboriginal people's lives: where they could live, where they could travel, who they could marry, and what children, if any, they could raise. Actions of brute force were carried out under claims of 'good intentions', but in truth betrayed the ignorance of arrogance, 'knowing better than our Indigenous peoples'. In acknowledging that fact, I repeat the words of my predecessor, Mr Rudd: I am sorry. Truly sorry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In past years, we have on this anniversary reported on our efforts to improve the life expectancy, health, education and economic outcomes for Indigenous Australians. But, as with so much that had been tried before, our efforts were based more on telling than listening, more on grand aspirations than the experience of Indigenous peoples. So, while there was no lack of money, will or work, our targets were unmet, and, while there was some progress, our ambitions were unfulfilled. Mostly, it was because we were perpetuating the very idea that has plagued our country for so long—that we knew better. We had to move to partnership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so, in July last year, we signed a new National Agreement on Closing the Gap, an agreement reached through a historic partnership between Australian governments and Indigenous peak organisations. It's a new chapter in our efforts, one built on mutual trust, respect and dignity. It not only sets new targets; it changes how<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>we achieve them and who's driving them. Following this momentous achievement, all governments and the Coalition of Peaks will deliver their implementation plans in the middle of this year—12 months on from the national agreement. From here on, reporting on our national progress will occur mid-year, but my hope is that this anniversary will remain a poignant reminder in our national life and parliamentary calendar, as it should.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we recall what happened in this chamber—and in the life of our nation—13 years ago, we should also remind ourselves of the hope of that day. After Mr Rudd and Dr Nelson had spoken, Aunty Lorraine Peeters, a member of the stolen generations, presented the parliament with a gift. Think about that: a gift, after being wronged. The gift was a coolamon. The coolamon carries newborns. It carries life itself, the future and, with it, our hopes. The coolamon was accompanied by a message: 'On behalf of our people, thank you for saying sorry.' What grace, and what hope. The message went on to say:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We have a new covenant between our peoples, that we will do all we can to make sure our children are carried forward, loved and nurtured and able to live a full life.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  I begin by acknowledging the Ngunawal people and pay my respects to their elders, past, present and emerging. I pay tribute to Minister Wyatt, shadow minister Burney, Senator Patrick Dodson, Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, Senator Jacqui Lambie and Senator Lidia Thorpe, who have brought their commitment and passion to making a positive difference to our national parliament. I welcome members of the stolen generations who have joined us here today. We are humbled by your presence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 13 years since it was delivered by Kevin Rudd, the Apology to the Stolen Generations has in retrospect taken on a sense of inevitability, but it was anything but inevitable. It was resisted for years. It was resisted on the day itself by some members of this place, who walked out, rather than being part of this moment of national significance and atonement. When history was made in this room, they chose to be in another. It is almost unimaginable now, but, at the time, it was dressed up as an expression of principle, of courage. The real courage, of course, was of those members of the stolen generations who came to this place, here, which had long stood as a pinnacle of an entire system that had failed them, as governments of all persuasions had. Each year, when the anniversary falls, as we vow to narrow the chasm, which we so gently call a 'gap', we are reminded of all of the unfinished business that surrounds us, business that is spelt out in an unflinching litany of lopsided statistics. These statistics have this year been delayed. The truth is that no government can proclaim that it has got all of these issues right. We have all failed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the Uluru Statement from the Heart places before us an invitation to go further. Let us have the voice to parliament, because the denial of a constitutionally enshrined voice is a denial of the Australian instinct for a fair go. But the voice will be nothing without truth-telling—truth that must fill the holes in our national memory. I spoke recently at the War Memorial about those Indigenous Australians who donned the khaki and fought for a nation that was not prepared to fight for them. They fought for a continent for which their own people had fought during the frontier wars, wars we have not yet learnt to speak of so loudly. They, too, died for their loved ones. They, too, died for their country. We must remember them just as we remember those who fought more recent conflicts. It must all be a part of our reckoning with the truth. Without it, we cannot be whole. 'Makarrata', that powerful Yolngu word, means coming together after a conflict. A makarrata commission as outlined in the Uluru statement would oversee a national process of truth-telling, agreement and treaty making. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The anniversary of the apology also demands we look to the removal of Indigenous children going on now. Last year's <span style="font-style:italic;">Family matters report </span>points to a troubling trend. Put together by the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care, it tells us that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children represent 37.3 per cent of the total population of all children removed from their parents, but they represent just six per cent of our total child population. Just think about that. Between 2013 and 2019, the rate at which those children have been placed with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander carers actually fell from 53.6 per cent to 43.8 per cent. If we don't address this, those gaps, not least in mental health and incarceration rates, will only widen and we will have the makings of another apology in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many areas that fall to the states, but the federal government have the responsibility to do our part. As the Uluru statement puts it, when we have power over our destiny, our children will flourish. On the day of the apology, Mick Dodson wrote about the false divide between the symbolic and practical aspects of reconciliation. Mick wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The reality is that how you feel about yourself, and whether you feel your culture and your history is acknowledged and respected is a key part of facing your problems and being able to turn things around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this spirit, Labor extends the hand of bipartisanship in support of a referendum on constitutional recognition this term, which is what Minister Wyatt committed to at the National Press Club on 10 July 2019. Let's not keep kicking this down the road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's support is based on just two conditions: that the proposal is supported by First Nations people and that it is consistent with the Uluru statement. Let it be worthy of the grace that we saw in 2008. On that extraordinary day 13 years ago, as the Prime Minister has said, Aunty Lorraine Peeters, who I had the honour of meeting on that day, a member of the stolen generations, presented Prime Minister Rudd with a glass coolamon, and she said, 'We have a new covenant between our peoples.' Let us commit to extending that covenant. We have what it takes. Let us get it right and then let's get it done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a great country, but an even greater nation is within our reach. We have the chance to again make history. Let us not go looking for a way out but instead embrace a way forward together. It has been identified for us in the beautiful, extraordinary and remarkably generous Uluru Statement from the Heart. Opening our hearts to advance this agenda will enrich all of us, just as we are all diminished by our national Constitution not recognising the privilege of living with the oldest continuous civilisation on earth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see all too often the disadvantage in our communities, the struggles of our people to be heard.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My mother's own story, and that of her brothers and sisters, has affected my approach to life and what I fight for. I have read my grandparents' and mother's native welfare files that outline the way in which they were controlled and managed by government and the institutions of the day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 13 February 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd stood at the dispatch box and delivered a formal apology to Australia's Indigenous people—particularly to the stolen generations, victims of past government policies of forced child removal and cultural assimilation. On that day, on behalf of all Australians he said: 'I am sorry,' and I associate myself with the comments of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Today those words are as important, as a reminder of the journey that we have all walked, a significant moment on the path to reconciliation and an acknowledgement of our shared history and the importance of our contribution to this national story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the national apology came the effort to close the gap. For over a decade, we saw mixed results, inconsistencies in outcomes and a failure to achieve permanent change. This is not to detract from the commitment and motivation of former governments in their efforts to close the gap. Under our government, we are changing the way in which we work with Indigenous Australians, not just in our efforts to close the gap but in everything we strive to do. Our government is committed to working in genuine partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians because we know that the best outcomes occur when governments and Indigenous Australians work together, from the landmark national agreement on closing the gap to the ongoing work to empower Indigenous Australians through the Indigenous voice codesign process and ongoing work to ensure economic recovery provides opportunity for our peoples through skills, jobs and wealth creation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has made it clear that the National Agreement on Closing the Gap is a whole-of-government priority. The targets and reforms agreed to in the national agreement require governments to change the way we work, and, as a government, we are changing the way that we do business. Our ministers are working together, and with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, to deliver a Commonwealth implementation plan that will achieve better life outcomes in partnership with our people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This includes the work underway to develop the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Early Childhood Strategy, in concert with SNAICC, as part of our implementation approach. Working in partnership, our focus is to ensure young children have access to good-quality, culturally safe and accessible care and education services. This means that when a child goes to school they'll have a better chance of success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across all jurisdictions and with the peak organisations there will be shared accountability. For the first time state and territory governments will need to present to their parliaments on their progress towards closing the gap. It is the job of all Australian governments to address Indigenous disadvantage and to implement programs that contribute to closing the gap in all of the key and critical areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister will deliver the Commonwealth's implementation plan and report on progress that we have made against the targets using the Productivity Commission's data review midyear, and it will clearly show how our actions are contributing to achieving the priority reforms and targets and how we are reporting and leveraging existing initiatives—such as mental health, skills and job creation—to achieve targets and to embed the four priority reforms. The new actions we commit to taking are actions to bring about the change imagined in the national agreement, and significant progress is being made. It is about thinking differently, but there is much more to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I state that our commitment to working in genuine partnership is the foundation for the changes that we need to achieve. As we implement the National Agreement on Closing the Gap, we will continue to work closely with our people. We will continue to co-design an Indigenous voice because there is much that we can take from the past as we look to the future. I ask that we all look at the role that we can play in empowering Indigenous Australians, our elders and traditional owners, and work to continue to improve the lives and futures of the next generation of Indigenous people as we continue to walk side by side, as one, to reflect, respect and celebrate that which makes us all Australians: Indigenous and non-Indigenous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw that reflected in one of the recipients, Miriam, who said, 'Do things with us: walk with us, work with us, listen and then shape the future'. To all of the stolen generation members: what we want to do is honour what they achieved, acknowledge what happened and ensure that it doesn't happen to future generations. That is a challenge for every one of us in here, because when we are one we are strong and when we walk together we have limitless potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge, in closing, all of those who are still with us from the stolen generation and all Indigenous Australians who aspire to a better future, to better opportunities and to their rightful place in every facet of Australian life.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  I recognise country and everyone that has joined us today. I want to tell a very personal story of a remarkable day: 13 February 2008. The story had started many years before. It began with the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families—the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report—some 11 years earlier. It followed a decade of stubborn refusal by a Prime Minister and a government, for reasons I will never understand and from whom an apology required so little yet means so much to so many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will never forget 27 May 1997 when Mick Dodson and the late Sir Ronald Wilson lodged the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them </span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ome</span> report at the convention centre in Melbourne at the 1997 Reconciliation Convention. Senator Dodson, our chair, his bravery was extraordinary. He declared in front of the world there can't be reconciliation without social justice, a moment that held such power, such truth and, in my mind, always will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirteen years ago, after the election of the Rudd government, the apology allowed this country to breathe again. We'd been holding our collective breath for so long it was like suffocating. The power of words must never be underestimated: they can hurt but they can also heal. That day I sat in the third row of the Speaker's gallery, up there—your gallery, Deputy Speaker Gillespie. As I looked down on the chamber, there were present all living former prime ministers, bar one: Paul Keating, Bob Hawke, Malcolm Fraser and Gough Whitlam. I remember survivors of the stolen generation were sitting around the chamber, and we heard both the Prime Minister and the leader of the Labor Party talk about that today. I also acknowledge the presence of the stolen generations with us at the moment. We sat not quite believing the moment. As Prime Minister Rudd began to speak, the tears flowed not just in this place but across the nation. Prime Minister Rudd said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We apologise for the laws and policies of successive Parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We apologise especially for the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families, their communities and their country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For the pain, suffering and hurt of these Stolen Generations, their descendants and for their families left behind, we say sorry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To the mothers and the fathers, the brothers and the sisters, for the breaking up of families and communities, we say sorry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the conclusion of the apology, as the Prime Minister and my leader have said, a coolamon was presented to the parliament by way of Kevin Rudd and Jenny Macklin. It was a powerful acknowledgement of the apology as a coolamon is traditionally used to keep safe our infants. This was a remarkable gesture of grace, generosity and dignity. I don't think I'll ever see anything like it again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I left this chamber and made my way to the forecourt. Aunty Mae Robinson—she's gone now—was carrying a large black-and-white photo of a young Aboriginal girl with a big bow in her hair. It was her mother. We fell into each other's arms, and, through tears, Aunty Mae said: 'I brought Mummy with me today. She was removed and sent to Cootamundra.' On the lawn, thousands of people were holding each other and crying. It was a good day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the apology was not just about saying sorry; it was about making things right. It marked the beginning of a commitment by government to close the gap, to heal the very real inequalities between First Nations and other Australians. We all know the grim statistics, so familiar that our eyes glaze over and our ears close up, but think of these statistics, so familiar, as our mothers and brothers, fathers and cousins, sisters and friends who pass on while still so young. Labor supports the new approach to closing the gap and the new targets, but in the 2020 report only two of the seven targets were on track. After more than a decade, the other five were not, including life expectancy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Refreshing the targets and setting new deadlines that are yet further away must not become a bureaucratic sleight of hand that lets this parliament off the hook for another decade—and I include all of us in that—because by 2031 a whole generation will have passed. We must all be accountable for the central commitment of closing the gap—closing the life expectancy gap in a generation. In 2005 the <span style="font-style:italic;">Social Justice Report</span> set Australia the challenge of closing the gap. As one of the first items of business, the Rudd Labor government committed to closing the gap as part of a great national effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017, the Uluru Statement from the Heart set this country the challenge of delivering voice, treaty and truth. Three and a half years later, those aspirations remain outstanding. If we want to see real and lasting progress on closing the gap, First Nations people must be at the centre of decision-making. I know the new agreement is about that. That is why Labor is totally committed to all three elements of the Uluru statement: a constitutionally enshrined voice to the parliament, not just the government; and a makarrata commission of treaty making and truth telling, because the healing power of telling the truth, as my leader has said, did not end with the apology; it began.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A constitutionally enshrined voice to the parliament is within our grasp if this government wants it and we extend our hand. As the Labor leader has said, we want to work with you in the spirit of bipartisanship to make this a reality in this term of parliament. I don't care who gets the credit. I really don't. I just want to see it done. If political parties offer their full-throated endorsement of an enshrined voice to the parliament and a model is settled with the broad support of First Nations communities, I have no doubt a referendum will succeed. There is time to get this done if we work together and with the community. The government started out this term speaking with real ambition, and now it's time for action. An enshrined voice to the parliament would mark the beginning of a pragmatic new way of doing business for all of us—a new way of listening, of being heard, of being accountable and of making sure the laws, programs and policies of the government are actually working to achieve what we, on this day each year, profess as our national duty: to finally close that gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I complete my statement with a direct quote from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Most of us girls were thinking white in the head but were feeling black inside. We weren't black or white. We were a very lonely, lost and sad displaced group of people. We were taught to think and act like a white person, but we didn't know how to think and act like an Aboriginal. We didn't know anything about our culture. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We were completely brainwashed to think only like a white person. When they went to mix in white society, they found they were not accepted [because] they were Aboriginal. When they went and mixed with Aborigines, some found they couldn't identify with them either, because they had too much white ways in them. So that they were neither black nor white. They were simply a lost generation of children. I know. I was one of them.</span>

                  </a>  Crown money is tainted money, and it has no place in politics. Big corporations have too much power over politics and politicians, and they exercise that power through political donations. Because these big corporations make political donations to Liberal, Labor and National, decisions get made in this place that are in the vested interests—not for the public interest. We have seen, time and time and time again, good legislation and good reforms that are for the welfare of the Australian people be stymied in this place by politicians who take money and whose parties take money from these big corporations, including Crown casino.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no coincidence that the major parties were taking donations from the gambling industry for years and years and years, and as a result families and people around this country and children continue to be devastated by the effects of problem gambling because the establishment parties in here are on the take. They are taking money from the Crown casino. It is time to get this money out.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  Two years ago the Treasurer stood before the Australian people, puffed up with confected anger, and cried a river of crocodile tears. Releasing the final report of the banking royal commission, he could barely have been more explicit in his criticism of the banks and the system which allowed them to perpetrate serious crimes on thousands of unsuspecting victims. He said the report was a scathing assessment of the banks' behaviour, driven by a culture of greed that breached the law. He said the price paid by the community was 'immense'. He spoke of broken businesses, the emotional stress and the personal pain that thousands of victims had experienced. He promised change. This is what he said at the time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the community's trust in our financial institutions has been lost and this is why it must now be restored. From today, the banking sector must change, and change forever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He then promised action on all 76 recommendations of the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us who've been involved for a long period of time paid careful attention to those words. Promising action on all of the 76 recommendations is not the same thing as promising to implement each of those 76 recommendations. We were sceptical because this government had voted 26 times against the forming of the royal commission. So resistant had they been to a spotlight on the goings-on within the financial sector, we could not trust them to implement the recommendations of that royal commission. We were right to be sceptical, and their actions every day since have proven that to be true. You could fill Lake Illawarra with the crocodile tears the Treasurer wept on that day. Two years on, just 27 of the 76 recommendations have had any action—that's just one-third. Worse, the very first recommendation, recommendation 1.1 to keep the responsible lending laws in place, the government has sneakily rejected; and it now plans to unwind those laws that were put in place over a decade ago helping us to get through the global financial crisis and this most recent crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will come back to that issue. But for now I want to say that the issue of the wide gulf between what the Treasurer says and does is growing by the day. This is not the only broken promise this government has made. Time and time again, the government has broken its promises to the Australian people, particularly when it comes to their personal finances. When this government makes a promise, it's time to take out some insurance. Remember the last election, when the Prime Minister and the Treasurer promised workers that they would get their legislated superannuation contributions, that he wanted to see them paid in full? It was another broken promise from this two-faced government that simply cannot be trusted with workers' money. While they pay themselves a healthy superannuation contribution of 15.4 per cent, they are now planning to cut workers' superannuation contributions—9½ per cent is enough for the workers, according to this government. Where they once told everyone that 12 per cent was adequate they now argue, all of a sudden, that 9½ per cent is adequate—15.4 per cent for them, 9½ per cent for the people who clean their offices. That tells you everything you need to know about this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Between now and the next election, we will be reminding every one of their voters what they intend to do with their superannuation. There is absolutely a big con going on here, a huge con. First, they are trying to use the COVID crisis as cover to cut workers' superannuation. But workers aren't buying it. The second big con is this: they are somehow trying to convince people that if their superannuation is cut they will somehow get a pay rise. Workers aren't buying it. They know what happened to the last bloke who cut their superannuation and they know what happened to their wages after that. I am of course talking about former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. He argued that if you cut superannuation then wages would magically grow in response. What have we seen since 2013? Wages have flatlined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this Prime Minister gets his way and gets to cut workers' superannuation again, the very same thing will happen. We are not going to see a magical increase in wages. In fact, we know it because we have before this parliament this week legislation which is attempting to enable workers' wages to be cut, their penalty rates to be reduced and their job security to be made even more insecure. You cannot trust a word that this Prime Minister and this government have to say about superannuation, about workers' wages and their personal finances. The Morrison government's plan for economic recovery is quite simply this: cut workers wages and conditions and hope for the best. We're not buying it and the workers of Australia won't buy it either. There is nothing more certain than this government being willing to run a protection racket for those organisations that are exposed by the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go through the history that has led us to this point. First, they tried to stop the royal commission. They voted against it 26 times. At least that was an honest approach. Having failed to stop Labor's campaign to get the royal commission happening, they then promised the Australian people, through a veil of mock outrage, that they'd implement the royal commission's recommendations. Predictably, when the news cycle moved on, they invented excuse after excuse to break that promise. Two years ago, Josh Frydenberg promised to protect Australians from greedy banks who were too willing to break the law for a quick buck. Now, instead of making the banks follow the law, he's changing the law so that the banks can keep taking advantage of vulnerable Australians. His excuse is the pandemic. We are not buying it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently, there's a consumer credit squeeze that's threatening to derail the economic recovery. That's news to everybody else outside of the government party room. Apparently, the responsible lending laws are somehow to blame, the same laws that simply ask banks to do two things: if you're going to offer a loan to somebody, make sure they can afford it; and make sure that it's appropriate. It's not a very high hurdle to get over. In the old days, we would have called it just good business sense: make sure that the loan you're going to offer somebody is affordable and make sure it's appropriate. But, apparently, according to this government and to this Prime Minister and to this Treasurer, that hurdle is too high and is, somehow, choking off the recovery. This excuse runs in the face of the facts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Auction clearance rates in the housing market in Sydney last weekend were up to 90 per cent. Home lending over the month of December alone was up 10 per cent. In fact, many economists are concerned we're at the very beginning of a housing price bubble. Housing prices are booming. There is absolutely no evidence, no evidence whatsoever, that the current responsible lending laws are choking the economic recovery. The hint is in the name: responsible lending laws. They ensure that if you're lending somebody some money you're doing it responsibly. We're going to back the laws that have been critical to our economic stability for the last 11 years—an observation that was made by the Treasury themselves when they gave a submission to the banking and finance royal commission. Far from putting a restraint on economic activity, they argued that the responsible lending laws were probably stabilising economic growth and ensuring that credit flowed responsibly, a submission that we 100 per cent endorse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where is the evidence that asking banks to take a responsible approach to lending is hurting the economy? It simply is not there. All we have, instead, is a desperate Treasurer looking for ways to retreat from his pantomime of sympathy just two years ago. For evidence of this, look no further than the Treasurer's confected concern about the Down syndrome teenager sold life insurance by an unscrupulous commission-hungry bank salesman. Two years ago the Treasurer said, 'This is appalling.' He promised that such things would never happen again on his watch. Late last year the man's father wrote to the Treasurer and begged him not to scrap these laws. We call on the Treasurer, we call on the government—we call on every member of the government—to listen to the words of that father. Do the right thing. Keep the laws in place. Back your very own promise to implement the recommendations of the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are running a very real risk that the whole story of the royal commission gets overturned. A very dangerous story is being peddled by members on the government benches, at the moment. Three years after the royal commission—and let's not forget the 10,000 submissions from victims of financial misdoings and financial crimes—and two years after the royal commission handed the report to the Treasurer, what we heard back then was the government saying: 'We were shocked. We did not know—we could not know—that this behaviour was going on.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this could not be further from the truth. If you look at the recommendations that were issued by the royal commissioner, by Ken Hayne himself, and if you look at the history of those recommendations, the overwhelming majority of them had been presented to government before—through recommendations of the Productivity Commission, through recommendations of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, through recommendations of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and through recommendations of committees of this parliament. If you go back and trace each and every one of those recommendations, you'll find that they had been presented to government before. Far from the government being surprised at what the royal commission found, far from the government being taken back and saying, 'Oh my God, these recommendations—there's a lot of work here; we didn't expect any of it,' each and every one of those recommendations had been presented to government before. So there can be no excuse for ignorance and there can be no excuse for inaction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government is peddling this myth: 'That that was then and this is now. COVID has changed everything. The banks have learnt their lessons, and they are now going to behave in a responsible way, as are the insurers and the superannuation companies.' Well, putting that argument at its very highest, let's just assume they're right—that the senior personnel within those banks and insurance companies have learnt the lessons of the royal commission and will correct their behaviour. History teaches us one thing, and of this we can be certain: the senior personnel of those banks will move on and their behaviours will creep back in, by stealth at first and then with great force. It is exactly for this reason that we need strong laws and strong regulators. But what we have seen from the government and government members is that, each and every time they have the opportunity, they seek to undermine the authority and the powers of the regulators. Their argument beforehand was that the regulators, who they put in place and who were under their watch, somehow weren't doing their job at the time. But we've also seen some pretty extraordinary things said by government members more recently. When the regulators actually do their job, we see aggrieved government members arguing that they should stop, that ASIC's going too hard on the poor banks and the poor financial sector; they should stop going so hard on those they regulate.</span>

                    </a>  This is exactly what they are doing! I've heard the member for Mackellar, who's always got an interjection to make, make exactly the same argument. Then they argue that somehow the regulators should spend less time making regulations and more time going out and chasing corporate criminals. I ask you to interrogate that for a moment. I have stood at this dispatch box over the last three years and I have argued—when bills come before this House with a thin stream of legislation meandering its way through vast meadows of regulatory delegation—that this is not the way the parliament should be doing its job. If something is important enough to legislate and regulate then the force should be in the legislation itself and not delegated to a regulator, such as ASIC, Treasury, APRA or another regulator. The parliament is the place where this regulation should be done. These members over here, including the member for Mackellar, have argued against me and said that this is confected outrage. Yet they themselves are the ones who are saying that ASIC is too busy making regulations, under the powers authorised by the government, to do its job of hunting down corporate crime and corporate misgivings. It's confected outrage! The member for Goldstein should know it. The member for Mackellar and the senator for New South Wales in the other place are equally culpable in this respect. We should resist the narrative that is being peddled by this side that somehow the royal commission is done and dusted, that COVID has changed everything and that we can turn back the clock and let everything go back to the way it was before. We should resist this narrative, and we should start by doing it in this place.</span>

We welcome the enhancements contained in the bill governing the provisions of financial advice to clients under ongoing fee arrangements.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In supporting this amendment, we make the observation that members of the government have fought against these provisions for seven long years or more. Indeed, when we go back to the Ripoll inquiry in 2013 where some of those matters were first exposed and the Future of Financial Advice reforms were brought into this place, members of the Liberal Party and the National Party fought Labor tooth and nail—an egregious restraint on financial advice. The world would come crashing down. They fought against it. In fact, they rolled it back when they had the opportunity to do so. They rolled back many of the key provisions of the Future of Financial Advice reforms. We then had the royal commission. We now have this legislation before the House today. It's through gritted teeth that we know that members of the government will be voting for this provision, which will implement that recommendation of the Hayne commission. About damn time.</span>

The Hayne commission exposed this and gave it a name: fees for no service. There should be outrage. It's a behaviour that members on this side of the House ran a protection racket on year after year after year.</span>

They knew it was going on. They counselled government to do something about it because not only could they see that it was a crime being committed against those unwitting customers of those financial advisers—the rogues—and there were victims of that rogue behaviour but they could see that it was bringing down the reputation of the profession as a whole. They urged government to do something about it. Government was not willing to move until it was exposed by the Hayne royal commission.</span>

It's interesting the way the lunar new year usually gives us exactly what we need when we need it. It's predicted to be a year of great opportunity and economic prosperity. But it's been a much quieter lunar new year this year than I've experienced in my 16 years of enjoying it in Parramatta. Usually we have the Chinese community, the Australian Korean community and the Australian Vietnamese community celebrating. I go from event to event. There is lots of dancing, lots of food, lots of fireworks, lots of colour and, of course, the lion dancing. We did have that this year. On Saturday, once again, the Sydney Youth Dragon &amp; Lion Dance Troupe with William and Jane Ho formed up at Parramatta Town Hall and went down Church Street blessing the various businesses in the street. It's something I usually participate in every year and it's a great event. </span>

This is now an Australian festival. It has been celebrated in Australia for more than a century. We do it every year now and we'll do it again next year. Happy new year!</span>

We met with a number of delegations of doctors, discussing the rural doctor crisis. We met with, I think, 12 different mayors in a couple of different groupings, and I can tell you that pretty much the No. 1 topic on the mayors' list as well as the doctors' list is the shortage of doctors in the region. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a debate or a discussion recently around the fact that there was an article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Weekend Australian</span> saying that we spent $2 billion on these problems over the last 10 years but we've still got the problem, and I couldn't agree with that more. I think we are going to have to strike a different stance on making sure that we've got good medical cover in the country. One of the doctors I met with had been looking at retirement. He'd served the Port Augusta community for 50 years and moved to Adelaide. He's now moved back to prop up the service at the age of 78. We can see this retirement wave coming down the pipeline as practitioners in their 60s and 70s are saying, 'I can't go on anymore.' We're seeing practices pulling back from providing services to hospitals and we're seeing state governments forced to use locums to fill up the gaps at four times the cost.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  Last week, on Monday 8 February, I joined some wonderful supporters and volunteers at the Capri Cinema in my electorate to call on the Prime Minister to do more to support independent cinemas across Australia. Independent cinemas across Australia had a day of campaigning last week. My electorate is home to the majority of South Australia's independent cinemas including the Capri Cinema, the Palace Nova Cinemas and the Piccadilly. These are much-loved independent venues in Adelaide. Not only do they provide entertainment but they're also an important drawcard for other businesses in the area like cafes, restaurants and shops, and they support many other local businesses. But, as we all know, COVID has hit the independent cinemas and they've suffered around a 70 per cent loss in revenue. They still cannot operate at 100 per cent. Their cinemas are half empty, or you could call them 'half full'. Many of them are way down in takings and turnover, and many new releases from the US and Hollywood are not coming to our shores. People are holding back until COVID is done. They will be up and running, hopefully, later on. Many of them are Australian owned family businesses that will struggle to stay open when JobKeeper ends in March. And I'm joining together with many other colleagues in calling for a targeted government support package to see them through this health and economic crisis. We cannot afford to lose our independent cinemas and the government must— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Happy new year! Australia is blessed to have a large number of diverse Chinese Australians who have come here from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and other places, as part of the Chinese diaspora throughout the world. Their contribution has made Australia immeasurably richer. They, of course, were here in the early part of Australia's history as a colony during the gold rushes, but, more recently, in the last two to three decades, they have migrated in large numbers and chosen to make their homes in places like my own city of Sydney, also in Melbourne and, indeed, throughout Australia. Everywhere they have settled, they have made a contribution. Be it enriching the cultural life or enriching community life with the value that they place on education, family values and upholding the stability and security of Australia, they've made a tremendous contribution.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that this has not been an easy year in relations between Australia and the People's Republic of China for a number of reasons. Of course, Australia is committed to working through those and ensuring we have a productive and constructive relationship with mainland China, but it's always important to make sure that those disputes are kept in the diplomatic sphere, and we recognise that our differences with another country should not reflect our attitudes towards people of that ethnicity living in Australia.</span>

It is the need in this nation for a royal commission into veteran suicide. It is far past time that those opposite stand up and stop the protection racket for this incredibly important issue for people in our nation. In my electorate, at a veterans roundtable that I had in the last couple of weeks, the young veterans in particular are asking for this and want to know why the former Defence people in the government are not standing up and saying: 'Yes, this is a massive issue. Yes, we need to have a holistic arms-length inquiry to find out why the patriots of this country, the men and women who have served us in uniform, keep taking their lives and why they keep dying by suicide.' </span>

The Minister for Veterans' Affairs says it will cost $100 million. I could go through a list of companies that keep paying out executive bonuses and dividends through JobKeeper. If we used those funds, we could have a royal commission into veteran suicide tomorrow. We need it done.</span>

The funding has been delivered to Brisbane City Council and will support a year's worth of employment and support to local businesses and industry across Brisbane. In my electorate of Bonner, I'm very pleased to see these two projects will benefit from this funding. Lota Skatepark will receive a much-needed upgrade with a complete replacement of the existing facility. This project will be funded with $400,000 from the grant, and council will work with local park users to determine the best design and elements to give locals a fresh new skate park facility for all to enjoy. </span>

Construction will get underway mid-year and will be completed by the end of the year, just in time for the school holidays. Thanks to the Morrison government, Brisbane City Council will be able to deliver a diverse range of projects across the city, including these projects in my electorate of Bonner.

Kevin worked as a criminal lawyer with Aubrey Brown Lawyers on the coast for 34 years. He was highly respected locally for his volunteer and pro bono work, including mentoring mock trial students from local high schools. He also played a key role in the establishment of the Wyong Local Court's Traffic Offender Intervention Program and the Wyong Community Aid Panel Program in the 1980s. Both programs are recognised as being ahead of their time and are now commonplace across New South Wales, benefiting thousands of people. </span>

Under Kevin's watch, the club has built a strong community profile across and beyond the coast, with the leagues club supporting schools, other sports and charities in our community. Kevin also served as a director of the Wyong Race Club for 20 years. Kevin dedicated his life to Wyong, to our community, and he made our community a better place. </span>

To his wife, Nola, and their children, Kelly, Angela and Ben: thank you for giving so generously of your husband, and father, to all of us.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  I have some good news. Today the Essential Services Commission of South Australia released figures showing that electricity prices in my home state have fallen by an average of $111 a year for retail household customers. This is the third year in a row of reducing electricity prices in South Australia. The year before it was an average of $96 per household bill, and the year before that it was $62. So over the last 2½ years the average household electricity bill in South Australia has fallen by almost $270. You can contrast that with the last two years of the previous Labor government, where prices went up by over $400 a year for the average household electricity bill in South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great to see that the Morrison and Marshall governments are working together to reduce electricity prices in South Australia. One of the really good partnerships has been the Home Battery Scheme, which is a partnership between the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, at the federal level, and the state government. They are hoping to roll out 50,000 batteries linked to solar panel generation across the state. This is one of many things that are contributing to electricity prices coming down. I'm excited to see the news today of a further drop of over $100, but we have only just begun. We want to keep getting electricity prices down and make sure South Australia is the most competitive place to live and do business in the country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  There are times when I'm so proud to share the story of a local hero in my electorate. Today, I commend Ms Jennifer Tait, who has dedicated her life to helping people with disabilities. Ms Tait has opened both a plan management and support company, called Blue Goose, and a social enterprise cafe, the Purple Chicken. These businesses create jobs for young adults with disabilities and help them to transition into open employment in a variety of industries right across the border region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many young adults with disabilities in our community are either unemployed or underemployed, and this is being addressed through the Purple Chicken cafe. The cafe employs up to 30 young adults, who learn hospitality, social employment, social skills, employment preparation and daily living skills to live more independently. The participants love their training at the cafe so much that they're often heard to say, 'I'm never leaving.' Currently, three young adults have moved into their own homes, nine have achieved jobs, four have progressed to further training at school or work placements, and six are going for their driver learner permits. Young adults such as Rhys, Shaun, Ray, Harry and Mitch are a true inspiration and are working hard to lead fulfilling lives with the support of many in their NDIS plans. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  Two Friday nights ago, Townsville lost a young woman to a senseless crime. Twenty-two-year-old Jennifer Board had only just bought her new motorbike when she was hit by a car that was chasing a stolen car. Tragically, Jennifer did not survive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next day, the crash scene was covered in orange, Jennifer's favourite colour. A fence was lined with flowers and cards. Hundreds of people—friends, family and strangers—gathered together to try and make sense of the shock and grief that they were feeling. How could a young woman well known, respected and loved in our community be snatched from us in this way? Jennifer loved adventure, the outdoors, her bike and fitness. She loved helping people in her job at the gym. Her friends say she could never hurt a single person in her life. Now Townsville is without one of our people who exemplify what is great about our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The emotions at Saturday's impromptu community memorial were real and raw. Ever since, people have been asking the question: how could this have happened? It's a question that's repeated in my mind over and over. Why has it taken a tragic event like this one for Townsville's long-running issue with youth crime to get the attention it deserves? We owe it to Jennifer to be better, to do better. I'm sorry. We have failed you. Rest in peace.</span>

I rise today fresh from a 9.5-kilometre walk through the both beautiful and traumatised landscape of the Snowy Valleys. Tumbatrek was the brainchild of the late Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer. On and off since 1985, hundreds of people have gathered each year to walk and talk with all levels of government and share their ideas for our community. I thank the current Deputy Prime Minister, Michael McCormack, for entrusting me with Mr Fischer's walking stick.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Better telecommunications was a major talking point as we weaved in and out of towering gums over the weekend. Tumbarumba and surrounds, like many communities in the mighty Eden-Monaro, found itself cut off from the world during the darkest days of our Black Summer bushfires. The sense of isolation is now a deep part of the community's trauma. The Morrison government says it has committed $2 billion to bushfire recovery and that helping Australians recover is a national priority—good words but, sadly, hollow words for the people I spoke with at Tumbatrek. Of the more than $27 million those opposite have committed to strengthening telecommunications against natural disasters, just $100,000 has been spent. Fourteen months on from the worst natural disaster this country has witnessed, this government has spent less than 0.36 per cent of the allocated budget. Burnt-out communities I represent need these practicalities, and we will continue to fight for them—all photo ops and no follow-up. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

This club was formed by Des and Beryl Schodel and five friends when they started to play croquet on the cricket oval at Olivers Sports Complex in Eagleby in July 2010. By August 2010, the group had grown to 14 players and it was decided to form the Twin Rivers Community Mallet Sports Club. Sadly, Des is no longer with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The club continued playing on the cricket oval until September 2014, when changes to leasing arrangements meant they were forced to find a new location. Finding a permanent home for their beloved game has been problematic, and over the following six years the club moved to five different locations. But it was with great joy and celebration that club president Ian Every cut the ribbon recently to allow play to begin on their new courts. The club's new courts at Bedford Park in Eagleby have been made possible thanks to the three levels of government coming together to work for the community. This included a $30,000 community development grant from the federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The spirit and tenacity of this club is emblematic of our community, and I would like to thank all in the club for all their hard work. At last the Twin Rivers Community Mallet Sports Club have a place to call home, and I wish them the very best for the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  It is a difficult thing to be here while my home state is in a five-day lockdown and it is heartbreaking for all the Melburnians and Victorians who have endured so much throughout this pandemic. But our city have done something remarkable—they have already overcome the second wave—and I am absolutely confident that Victorians will overcome this current outbreak.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this virus is becoming harder to manage. We've seen outbreaks in quarantine in Adelaide, in Brisbane, in Perth, twice in Sydney and now, of course, in Melbourne. All of these cities bar Sydney have been in three- to five-day lockdowns with these highly infectious new strains of the virus. We've seen outbreaks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Vietnam. Countries with some of the most outstanding responses to the coronavirus are struggling to contain the mutated version of this virus.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This pandemic is not over, but the federal government are ending their support for businesses. They're ending JobKeeper for Victorian businesses. They've done a lot of press conferences on rolling out the vaccine, but they haven't done one simple thing: actually roll out the vaccine. I'm losing count of how many press conferences the minister and the Prime Minister have done. If they'd done as many vaccine rollouts, maybe we wouldn't have as many outbreaks as we do right now. This pandemic is not over. We need to continue to support businesses, we need to get the rollout of vaccines underway and we need to support Victorians in these difficult days.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I rise to speak on an issue that is absolutely outrageous. In Queensland the RSLs have put forward a proposal with a COVID-safe plan to the Queensland government for a very modest Anzac Day dawn service in Anzac Square and a small march at the RNA showgrounds. It has been weeks, and they have received absolutely zero response—crickets—from this Queensland Labor government. It seems that, if you're a member of Extinction Rebellion, you get more help from the Queensland Labor government to march in Brisbane than if you are a veteran. That is just crazy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be doing everything we can to see the Anzac marches go ahead, with Brisbane residents in attendance so they can support our veterans and, more importantly, so our veterans can feel their support. For goodness sake, if the Queensland government can find a way to have a ticketed event for the AFL grand final, with tens of thousands of people there, they can find a way to have a ticketed event for our veterans, so that our veterans can come together and feel the support of Brisbane residents. It is not that hard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned that COVID is being used as an excuse to simply cancel events when it's all getting too hard for the Queensland Labor government. Whether it's Australia Day—where this federal government had to step in to support those events in a COVID-safe way—or, now, Anzac Day, we need the Queensland Labor government to stand up and support our veterans so we can have a proper Anzac Day march go ahead under the current arrangements. This federal government and certainly I, as a local member, support it wholeheartedly. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Earlier today I spoke in the Federation Chamber about Etsy, which is an online, US based shopping portal. It's a very popular website, especially with women. It sells a lot of handmade, handcrafted goods. It's a really, really good website, except that, on this website, alongside Father's Day gifts, you can buy child sexual exploitation material. You can buy child sex dolls, which, of course, are illegal in Australia. But they make these available on the US based website, and Etsy—a major company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and a very well-credentialed board of directors—are doing nothing to stop this disgraceful trade. They're doing nothing to stop this reprehensible material being made available on their website. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shoppers will get onto Etsy and look up Father's Day gifts and gifts for the kids and they'll come across this material if they use the search function. It's really filthy stuff. I don't even want to say what the messages and slogans are on T-shirts, and, of course, the child sex dolls are absolutely outrageous. The dolls are illegal in Australia, and the rest of it should be. There's an online petition being run by a Victorian designer called Anna Cordell. It has 33,000 Australian signatures. I ask every member of this House to join this petition. Let's get this US based website to drop this disgraceful material. If they don't act, then the authorities should. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's one idea is to cut the pay of 2.3 million Australian workers by 25 per cent. If you're one of the one million casual workers in this country, Labor and their union mates will take away your casual loading and replace it with entitlements like long service leave, whether you like it or not. Never mind that many of these workers organise their lives to benefit from flexible hours and rely on the higher hourly pay that casual work delivers in order to make ends meet.</span>

On average, a Labor government would mean an overnight pay cut of almost $8,000 for millions of Australians who can least afford it. From struggling workers in hospitality, tourism, retail and construction who are still clawing their way back from a devastating year, the Leader of the Opposition wants to take away more than $150 a week. Labor don't understand workers, and they have no idea how to run an economy. It's obvious now to Australian workers if it wasn't before.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  How many times do we have to hear about sexual harassment, discrimination and even assault occurring in the corridors of this parliament, or in the bars and boardrooms surrounding it, before something is done to change it? Why is it that time and time again it takes a brave, often young woman to be strong enough to tell her story, to make herself vulnerable and exposed in public, before the gendered cultural and systemic failings of political culture are even discussed? How many scandals can this government ignore before it does anything real to address the cultural and systemic failings that are obvious for all to see?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every single person who comes into this building has the right to a safe and positive culture. It is unacceptable that the Australian parliament continues to leave unaddressed systemic biases which mean that women's experiences of working in this building are too often fundamentally different to men's. We can't continue to tolerate a workplace which too often allows gendered misuse of power to seemingly go unpunished, and, worse, in which the victim is the one who experiences damage to their career, their reputation and their health. It's time for this parliament to do two things: firstly, establish an independent review to see how wide and deep the problem is; and, secondly, work to establish an independent office to provide truly independent advice, counselling and support. Victoria, the UK and New Zealand are doing it. We should be doing it too.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  Last week the Australian and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation drove a stake through the heart of the citrus industry in my electorate of Mallee. Now, 100 per cent fruit and vegetable juice, with no added sugar, will score as low as two stars in the health star rating system. That is lower than many diet soft drinks. Although the Commonwealth voted against these changes, growers across the country have been betrayed by the states and territories that supported the new ratings, including Queensland, Victoria, the Northern Territory and the ACT. The health star rating system was designed to help consumers make healthier choices. However, following these new ratings when choosing something to drink will legitimately make you less healthy. These changes completely undermine the system and make it virtually pointless. The state and territory jurisdictions that supported these changes need to admit they got it wrong and work to rectify this ridiculous decision. Nathan Hancock of Citrus Australia, in Mallee, said this decision could rip hundreds of millions of dollars out of the regional industries and communities. We can only hope that consumers will use common sense and see these new ratings for what they are: idiotic. I will continue to support local industries in my electorate by drinking fresh fruit and vegetable juice, and I hope Australia will do the same.</span>

Just the latest in the long line of Liberal Party rorts is the scheme run by the member for Dickson, who treated money set aside to make Australian communities safe as yet another secret Liberal Party slush fund. Does anything better sum up this government than the minister responsible for community safety rorting money from a community safety fund? Because this Prime Minister has made it clear that he's just fine with corruption and rorts, the member for Dickson could confidently act with impunity in his abuse of taxpayer funds. This rort was so shameless. With the Liberal candidate for Braddon, he announced two grants in a by-election, before the guidelines for the fund had been established and before the application process had even opened. That's some rort! The ever-growing list of scandals surrounding the Morrison government shows why Australia needs a powerful, independent and transparent national anticorruption commission and why this Prime Minister and his Attorney-General will do everything in their power to prevent one from being established.</span>

This important best practice principle of empowering Ms Higgins is something that the government has always sought to follow in relation to this matter. </span>

This is an historic day for Australia. As the health minister has just confirmed outside this place, I can confirm that Australia's first delivery of COVID-19 vaccines has arrived. The vaccines have touched down in Australia—142,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine arrived in Sydney around midday today. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Free and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is this government's policy, and it is in delivery. One of the largest logistical exercises ever undertaken in this country has been planned for and is now underway. We have been building this vaccine portfolio—onshore manufacturing capability, the workforce, the cold chain logistics, the vaccination locations—working together with our medical experts, state and territory governments around the country to ensure the effective implementation of this critically important program for our country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This program has been developed by medical experts and approved by medical experts, so Australians can have confidence in the Australian vaccination strategy. The Therapeutic Goods Administration is final testing the Pfizer vaccine this week, and the government's total support across our vaccine program now amounts to some $6½ billion with an initial allocation of around $1.9 billion for the rollout of that vaccine. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People who need to get the protection first will get it first—the most vulnerable in our community, those working in those critical areas is where the vaccination strategy begins. But also I note that this is just the start of the process. I visited with the health minister last Friday in Melbourne the CSL installation where they're doing the final stages of the Australian production of the AstraZeneca vaccine, some 50 million doses. In August of last year we took the decision not to leave ourselves vulnerable to international supply chains and to ensure that we had the Australian sovereign capability to actually produce these vaccines here in Australia. We had the opportunity to thank those Australians who have been working around the clock for many months at CSL to ensure that the domestic production of those vaccines is available right here in Australia to ensure the success of our vaccination strategy. This will play a key role in continuing to restore confidence in not just the community but also the building and growing confidence that exists in our economy. It has always been our objective both to saves lives and save livelihoods, and the successful implementation and development of that vaccination strategy are there to see.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Cabinet and Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:06</span>):  Thank you very much to the member for Reid, particularly, for her work as a health professional taking care of the emotional needs and the psychological needs of Australians, before coming to this place. One of the important pieces of news today, before we get to the vaccines, is that I'm advised there are now no Australians in ICU for COVID-19 reasons, anywhere. These numbers, of course, may change over the course of the coming months, but as of this day we've seen zero lives lost in 2021 due to COVID in Australia—but, sadly, the world has reached approximately 2.4 million lives. We now have no Australians in ICU or on ventilation due to COVID and, significantly, we have had only one case today in the community, one case in Victoria, and none in seven out of eight states and territories, so a very important result nationwide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important thing to happen, as the Prime Minister has set out, is that the first shipment of vaccines has now arrived in Australia, 142,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Of those, which will now be taken by the TGA and they'll be assessed to make sure that safety, quality and there's no damage, no breach, of the integrity of them during the course of the transmission—that they've all been maintained. Subject to that, we will then be in a position to ensure that we have 62,000 doses provisioned for second doses in continuous supply and that we have 80,000 doses available, commencing on 22 February—Monday of next week—around Australia for the vaccination program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That program will begin with the most vulnerable, a combination of the border and quarantine workers, our frontline health workers, and our aged-care and disability residents and staff. That's about ensuring that those that are the most at risk of contracting and transmitting or those that are most at risk from the consequences of the illness are dealt with in that first phase. It's expected that first phase will take, approximately, six weeks. Subject to the Therapeutic Goods Administration making a positive decision on the AstraZeneca vaccine, we are then expecting that AstraZeneca international vaccines will add to that and double the number of weekly vaccines, in early March, if not earlier, and then this will be added to by the CSL production, coming out of their Parkville plant, of a million doses a week from late March. I've been advised that that fill-and-finish process commenced today. So today's an important day. It's the next step in protecting Australians, in saving lives and protecting lives.</span>

What's important is that, in that workplace, there should be the opportunities for Australians to be able to get the hours they're looking for, to be able to extend their hours and to be able to earn more in their place of work. The best way for them to achieve that is working for businesses that are actually making profits and are actually going forward. In the absence of a growing economy, in the absence of a government policy that is actually encouraging businesses to get back on their feet, workers are worse off.</span>

There are a whole lot of opportunities for the Prime Minister to give wide-ranging industrial relations answers, but this one is about same job, same pay.</span>

Yes, it was a tight question, but it was one of those questions that's highlighted in <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> as inviting a yes or no answer which you can't compel the Prime Minister or a minister to give. So the Prime Minister is entitled to go over the territory he went over until just very recently. The question doesn't allow an examination of alternative policies. The Prime Minister was in order until that point.</span>

We're seeing confidence lift in our economy. We're seeing the comeback well underway. Under those policies, Australian workers are better off.</span>

Minister, you're aware of China's Daru initiative in the Fly River, half of New Guinea. The Singapore Strait is controlled by Muslims enraged by Chinese treatment of Uighur. In the alternative Torres Strait, more young Chinese men with curious backgrounds have opened a shop on yams. Similarly, four Chinese are attempting to buy the tip of Cape York from traditional owners, two whitefellas from Sydney. Not a single Australian believes these are commercial initiatives. What action, Minister?</span>

Obviously the Australian government has an incredibly important and valuable relationship with the government of Papua New Guinea. The Prime Minister has a very close relationship with Prime Minister Marape, and all of us work constantly to make sure that we are doing all we can for PNG, a very important country in our region. We will work with PNG. I know the Prime Minister's raised this issue which I think is highly speculative, if I might say so, to the member for Kennedy. I've seen the press reporting around the Daru proposal. It's highly, highly speculative. But only this week the Prime Minister has raised that with Prime Minister Marape, and we will continue to work with our PNG counterparts.</span>

The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Health have had a particular focus on making sure we can have the vaccine rolled out across the Pacific, but in particular in PNG we're working closely with our colleagues.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commencement of administering the COVID vaccine will be a historic day, as we begin to look forward to a future beyond COVID and some sort of normality beyond this global pandemic. The Australian government is placing great stock in making sure that we've got the right strategy when it comes to the vaccine rollout. The rollout of the vaccine across Australia is going to be one of the largest logistical tasks ever undertaken by this nation. Just yesterday, I was in Western Sydney with the member for Parkes, the Minister for Regional Health, as well as the CEO of the DHL supply chain, Saul Resnick. We were looking at the protocols DHL have in place for this large logistical exercise. We were looking at the cold stores. We were talking about how the vaccine will be rolled out across Australia. It's a big country, and this is a massive task, but we will absolutely get it done. And the important thing is that regional and rural Australia will not be left behind. They will get the vaccine, just like the people in metropolitan Australia will. Certainly, they will be able to get that jab as soon as anybody in metropolitan Australia. The government is working with both DHL and Linfox to ensure cold chain and supply to all Australians, including those in every far-flung nook and cranny of this nation.</span>

And I know the role that the Minister for Health and the Minister for Regional Health have played in this exercise to ensure appropriate coverage across all Australians. It has been so important. I urge and encourage all Australians to get that jab to help their own health and to help their economic recovery.</span>

The earlier formulation of the question was whether or not it was agreed that two workers doing the same job at the same place in the same workplace should get the same pay. That is not even the Labor policy. When you read their speech, they say that a labour hire firm who employs someone at the same job at the same pay should get no less. It's actually not even their policy, and they have had some difficulties in working out what their own policy is.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The difficulties, of course, arise with labour hire. For the benefit of the House, the ABS notes that labour hire as a proportion of all employees has been stable at about two per cent over the last decade. What is very important—and what the government absolutely ensures occurs—is that under labour hire agreements people should have exactly the same rights as other employees, including, of course, unfair dismissal rights; award entitlements; bargaining rights; general protections; and work, health and safety protections to name but a few. The Labor Party say that they have a policy for perfect equality between those two forms of employment, but when you actually read their policy they acknowledge that that is incredibly difficult. Indeed, in their policy, they say that someone at the labour hire with the same type of work at the same place should get at least as much but could get more—not exact parity, as they pretended in their earlier question. The reason why that is actually very, very difficult to achieve in practice is, for instance, an employee who is remunerated directly—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian labour market is undergoing a remarkable recovery. The unemployment rate fell to 6.6 per cent in December; 320,000 jobs have been created in the last three months; 90 per cent of the 1.3 million Australian workers who either lost their jobs or saw their working hours reduced to zero at the start of the pandemic are now back at work; the participation rate is at the record high of 66.2 per cent; and last week we saw the Reserve Bank upgrade its employment forecasts and its rate of unemployment, which will see the rate of unemployment fall to six per cent this year and 5¼ per cent by mid-2023. On the RBA forecast the employment rate is recovering three times faster in the COVID recession than it did in the 1990s recession. We're seeing strong numbers across the rest of the economy. We see strong numbers in the housing market, strong numbers in terms of automotive sales and strong numbers in terms of business and consumer confidence coming back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also today we have new data from the ATO about the JobKeeper program in the December quarter. It shows that 2.1 million Australians have graduated off JobKeeper and 520,000 Australian businesses have graduated off JobKeeper. Across Western Australia there was a 70 per cent fall in JobKeeper recipients in the December quarter. Across South Australia there was a 67 per cent fall. In Tasmania there was a 65 per cent fall. In Queensland there was a 64 per cent fall. In Townsville there was a 72 per cent fall. Across New South Wales there was a 60 per cent fall. Unfortunately Victoria, which has experienced a second wave, had just a 44 per cent fall. What these numbers show is that across the economy, in every state and territory, across all regions and across all sectors, we are seeing thousands and thousands of our fellow Australians graduate off JobKeeper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is still a long way to go. Australians are doing it tough still. Across many regions they are doing it tough and in many sectors they are doing it tough. But JobKeeper has been a remarkable program. It's been an economic lifeline for millions of Australians and it has played an important role in the strengthening of the labour market which we're seeing right now, this very day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian economy begins 2021 from a position where it is strengthening. We're seeing an economic recovery that is underway. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that the economy of Spain is going to contract by around 11 per cent; the economy of the United Kingdom will contract by around 10 per cent; the economies of France and Italy will contract by around nine per cent; the economies of Germany, Canada and Japan will contract by more than five per cent; and the economy of the Unites States will contract by 3.4 per cent. But their forecast for Australia for its contraction in 2020 is less than three per cent. This is why, based on the economic and health position we are in today, you wouldn't want to be in any other country but Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A key part of that economic recovery that we have seen is the commitment by the Morrison government to $251 billion of economic support, $148 billion of which is already out the door. That includes $83 billion for JobKeeper out the door, a cash flow boost of $35 billion out the door, and $19 billion for the JobSeeker coronavirus supplement out the door already. When it comes to $750 payments—two of them—and a further $250 payment to millions of pensioners and carers and veterans and others on income support, around $10 billion is out the door. Those programs have been critical as an economic lifeline for the Australian community. But, on top of that, we've put in place the HomeBuilder program, which has more than 80,000 applications. The Master Builders Association has said it's helped save thousands of jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've put in place 340,000 training places. We've brought forward billions of dollars of infrastructure programs. When it comes to tax cuts, we believe in allowing Australians to keep more of their hard-earned money. There's more than a billion dollars a month that will be flowing through to the pockets of hardworking Australian families through our tax cuts. The combination of these programs, as well as the COVID support that we put in place at the height of the pandemic, is seeing economic recovery underway—that is, economic recovery that has seen 90 per cent of the 1.3 million Australians who either lost their jobs or saw their working hours reduced to zero at the start of the pandemic now back at work. There's a long way to go, but the Australian economy is recovering.</span>

The coalition made it unlawful to misrepresent an employment relationship by treating someone as a contractor rather than as an employee. In the 2019-20 budget we took further action in that space—action that was never taken by members opposite—by providing $9.2 million in additional funding to the Fair Work Ombudsman to establish a dedicated unit to crack down on sham contracting.</span>

Indeed, part of the legislation before the House is to ensure, for the first time, criminal penalties would apply to wage theft, and members opposite will vote against that. For the first time ever there'll be sufficiently strong penalties to ensure that people are not underpaid, including a quantum of benefits obtained, which means that the financial penalty will actually, for the first time ever, provide a disincentive to underpayment. Members opposite want to vote against that measure. For the first time ever, people who are in casual employment will have a strong, secure, consistent pathway to move from casual employment to permanent employment, and members opposite want to vote against that as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry, Science and Technology</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:32</span>):  I thank the member for his question. Our government understands that science and technology are key enablers of industry growth, and that is particularly important through new technologies that are going to give our industry a cutting edge on the global stage, that will boost competitiveness, create jobs and take our economy forward. That's why we've made a record investment in innovation, science and research in the budget. That's why our $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy focuses on harnessing science and research collaboration to deliver the real practical results that we, as a government, are very focused on delivering. Our government has always backed innovative businesses, by getting the economic conditions right, as well as through a range of very practical support programs—for example, our Accelerating Commercialisation program, which has a tremendous track record of helping Australian entrepreneurs take their products to the world. There's a whole range of different products that we have supported as a government. It includes a nasal spray that can help treat dementia. It includes self-driving smart wheels that can be clipped onto manual wheelchairs. It includes long-life milk or fresh milk that can be made to remain on the shelves for up to 60 days.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And just yesterday I was delighted to announce a further $4.2 million in matched funding in the latest round of the Accelerating Commercialisation grants. This includes $1 million for agricultural science company Sea Forest. Sea Forest will use that funding to increase supplies of their seaweed additive for livestock feed. This reduces livestock methane emissions, and it improves herd health. So it is a win for the environment and it is a big win for our farmers. Over the last five years, Sea Forest has worked very closely with the CSIRO to test and refine its product, and this is exactly what the Morrison government is all about: doing all that we can to facilitate industry and researcher engagement, because, as we harness that, we know that our businesses will be able to grow.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government we are very committed to making sure that our small businesses grow into medium enterprises and our medium enterprises grow into large businesses. One of the ways that we're going to do that is by harnessing the technology and making sure that we are using technology and not taxes.</span>

Prime Minister, food delivery rider Rosya suffered a concussion and an arm injury in a road accident while on the job. She says she had to return to work before she was ready because 'she had no other choice' and was then sacked because she couldn't ride fast enough due to her injuries. What's complicated about workers who are injured on the job having time to recover before returning to work?</span>

What our government is seeking to do is get people back into jobs; that's what we're seeking to do. We're seeking to get people onto higher rates of pay by ensuring they're not locked into award wages but have the opportunity to get into enterprise agreements, where the experience clearly shows that they have the opportunity to earn more. We want people to be able to get additional hours and additional shifts, and we want to ensure that the things that are preventing that are removed. That's what we're seeking to do. What those opposite are seeking to do is stop us from doing that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:39</span>):  I thank the member for Moncrieff, who is of course a former professional musician—one of the many diverse backgrounds on this side of the House—and is therefore very familiar with the glamour of show business but also the sheer amount of hard work that's involved. And I'm pleased to say we've had our fair share of the glamour of show business in recent months, with some of the world's leading directors and actors coming to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the pleasure of visiting the set of <span style="font-style:italic;">13 Lives </span>on the Gold Coast last week and I spoke with director Ron Howard, who told me why the movie is being filmed in Australia. It's because of our skilled and talented actors and crew. It's because of the great locations that Australia has. It's certainly because of Australia's careful management of the COVID risks, which has been noticed around the world, and of course it's because of the direct support provided under the Morrison government's $400 million Location Incentive Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as <span style="font-style:italic;">13 Lives</span>, we've got NBCUniversal filming <span style="font-style:italic;">Young Rock</span>, featuring Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson—and if, like me, you have a 12-year-old son, you are very familiar with his oeuvre. And <span style="font-style:italic;">Joe Exotic</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Irreverent</span> are also being filmed in Queensland. In Melbourne, there is <span style="font-style:italic;">Blacklight</span>, with Liam Neeson—and Canberra got in on the act, too. <span style="font-style:italic;">Escape from Spiderhead</span> is being filmed by Netflix on the Gold Coast. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tourist</span> is being filmed in South Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">Thor: Love and Thunder</span> is being filmed in Sydney. It's a cornucopia of global productions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's more than glamour. It's jobs. We've attracted 19 productions so far, under our Location Incentive Program, with a total production budget of almost $1.5 billion. That's over 11,800 jobs for all those skilled Australian crew and cast that Ron Howard talked about, all of the downstream businesses that are providing catering, props and all kinds of services to these productions. It builds on our support for the Australian film sector—our $50 million Temporary Interruption Fund, with 37 productions approved for coverage under that. We allocated an extra $53 million in last year's budget for Screen Australia and the Australian Children's Television Foundation. Our Location Incentive Program is succeeding in bringing global productions to Australia. We're building scale. We're creating jobs for our Australian screen production sector.</span>

I acknowledge the agricultural powerhouse that is the member's electorate, and the significant contribution it makes to our $65 billion agriculture industry. It will play a significant part in agriculture reaching its plan of being a $100 billion industry by 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget, the government announced our Ag2030 plan—a seven-pillar plan to support agriculture in achieving their goal. One of those key pillars is trade. You've got to understand that we're a nation of 25 million people and we produce enough food for 75 million people. So if don't engage the world, if we don't trade with the world, we don't need the number of farmers that we've got and we don't need the communities, like Shepparton, that are there to support them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we're building on the free trade agreements that we put in place with China, Korea, Japan, Peru, Indonesia, the TPP-11, which those opposite said we were wasting our time on. I'm proud to say, because of the investment in our budget inputting agricultural counsellors on the ground—these are the men and women that get rid of the technical barriers, in a country, at government-to-government levels—we are, for the first time, sending a shipment of barley to Mexico, going into their beer, because we've been able to support our producers to be able to diversify. We're also sending 730,000 tonnes of feed barley into Saudi Arabia. That's an extra $230 million to the Australian economy, diversifying our economic base, giving our farmers the opportunity to send boats left and right to be able to diversify into new markets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also working at making sure that those agricultural counsellors are expanded. Last budget, we went from 16 to 22. In fact, we put our first one in Mexico, in Mexico City, to address Latin America. And now, as part of further measures, we're having a surge of five additional agricultural counsellors that will look at new markets, working with industries, to ensure that we can open up market access, get rid of the technical barriers and allow our exporters to continue to diversify. But we're also looking at what we're doing, in how we as a government are in their lives and how we can get out of them as quickly as we can while maintaining the regulatory barriers that make sure that we protect brand Australia. And we're doing that by cutting red tape, working with industry to ensure that there are practical, technological ways in which we can help them not only apply for export permits but make sure that they are keeping up the regulatory framework that we would expect in protecting our brand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our technology framework is also looking at making sure we get rid of over 200,000 export permits a year issued manually, doing it digitally, also making sure that those that want to export are cutting the number of application forms from around 20 down to one. That's just common sense. So what we're doing is putting the environment around our exporters, around our agricultural sector, because if we trade with the world then, I can tell you, Australian agriculture will meet its $100 billion target by 2030.</span>

Is the Prime Minister aware that the $880,000 grant to the National Retail Association was a completely one-off separate grant from the safer communities program and the Minister for Home Affairs instructed his department to design that grant program for the National Retail Association at the same time as the NRA made a $6½ thousand donation to the Minister for Home Affairs?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness, Social and Community Housing</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:49</span>):  I thank the member for Forde for his question. Like so many on this side of the House, the member for Forde is so focused on the jobs of those in the residential construction industry—the tradies, the carpenters, the bricklayers and many others. I had the great honour last week of meeting a number of workers in the member for Forde's electorate who are benefiting from the HomeBuilder program. The HomeBuilder program has ignited the residential construction industry not just in Forde, not just in Queensland, but throughout our country in every major city, in every regional area and in every small town. The residential construction industry has been absolutely set alight by the HomeBuilder program. What we have seen, Treasury estimates, is $18 billion of direct construction activity as a result of HomeBuilder with $60 billion of broader economic activity being driven by the HomeBuilder program—$60 billion of economic activity that the Labor Party opposed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland, in the member for Forde's home state, we've seen 18,000 applications, 18,000 projects. Part of the reason we have seen up to a million jobs in the residential construction industry supported by the HomeBuilder program was brought home to me and the member for Forde when we visited the Stoddart Group in the member for Forde's electorate just last week. The Stoddart Group, which makes steel frames for homes, has now gone to three eight-hour shifts. Importantly, not only are we keeping their workforce gainfully employed in the HomeBuilder program, they have put on 40 new staff on the floor that the member for Forde and I were able to speak to; 40 people with fantastic jobs at the Stoddart Group because of that. In addition to that, the Stoddart Group also informed me that, due to the instant asset write-off—for which they wanted to thank the Treasurer—they'd also invested in six new roll forming machines at $1½ million. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see the HomeBuilder program igniting demand in the residential construction industry and taking advantage of other incentives being put in place by the government. Not only are we supporting the million jobs in the residential construction industry, which is so important and the primary driver of HomeBuilder, but we're also supporting first home buyers. Homeownership and first home buyers are so important to the members of the coalition. In fact, we've seen first home buyer levels at their highest for over 10 years. We've seen new home sales up by 32½ per cent. As I always say, new home sales means more jobs, more economic activity and that is what will partly fuel our recovery this year.</span>

The Morrison government is investing $270 billion in our defence capability, and our record investment is helping us to drive our economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession. Our investment is creating and supporting thousands of Australian jobs right across our great land. Just last week I had the great pleasure, together with the Prime Minister and some of our other colleagues, of visiting the Hunter region, where we announced that our first F-35 aircraft had been inducted into BAE Systems Australia's maintenance depot. This is part of the next milestone of the F-35 program, and indeed it was a very exciting and uplifting day. This depot will be a regional maintenance, sustainment and upgrade hub for the F-35 aircraft in the Asia-Pacific region. Hundreds of F-35 aircraft will flow through the doors of BAE in Newcastle in the decades ahead. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This investment, and this new maintenance hub, is all about protecting and securing Australia's interests, but it is much more than that. It's also about creating generations of jobs and driving investment in the Hunter region and across this wide brown land. This induction demonstrates to the world the leading capability of our local defence industry in Australia, and, let me tell you, it is something that we all should be incredibly proud of. I think the Prime Minister said it best the other day, when he said, 'Everyone involved with the F-35 program is a top gun.' Our government wants to give as many Australian companies opportunities in the F-35 program—</span>

These are companies like Marand, in Melbourne, who are manufacturing the vertical tails; Queanbeyan based Lintek, who produce the circuit boards and are the only company in Australia to do so; and Brisbane based TAE Aerospace, who are maintaining the F-35 engines. It's a real feather in the cap for Brisbane based TAE Aerospace, as this is the first time that the work they're performing on the F-35 has been done outside the US. It's great news for them, and it's a great example of the Australian capability.</span>

Under the Safer Communities program, we've committed over $180 million to local councils, places of worship, not-for-profit organisations and organisations working with at-risk young people, leading to greater community resilience and wellbeing. The split between coalition and Labor seats under that program—wait for this startling number—is 51.45 per cent to coalition seats, and 48.55 per cent to Labor seats. You would expect there to be a variation in the number because we have more seats in this place than they do. One may ask: 'What is this issue about? Why are they throwing mud?' I've been in this place long enough to watch a Labor leader under pressure. When they're under pressure they look to distract. They throw mud and they look to distract. You are in your dying days, brother.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:59</span>):  I thank the member for Dawson for an excellent question. The member comes from one of the outstanding resources sectors in Central Queensland. Around Dawson, there are an enormous number of jobs in the resources sector, and the member for Dawson stands up for jobs. He stands up for the coal sector, he stands up for critical minerals, he stands up for gas and he wants the people he represents to actually have a job into the future. In Queensland, there are some 78,000 individuals directly employed in the resources sector. There has been 17.9 per cent growth over the year, and in Queensland coal jobs are up 22.8 per cent, to 62,000—a 22.8 per cent increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the questions earlier in question time. I'm pretty sure the Leader of the Opposition didn't even meet any of those individuals at Moranbah. He didn't take the time to get there and head up to Central Queensland to get into a coalmine and see exactly what's happening on the ground. Whether you're in Bulga, whether you're in Dawson or whether you're working at Cannington, we are supporting those individuals who are out there working hard. We are the ones out there supporting their industry. We are the ones who continue to put money on the table to ensure there are opportunities into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've put $225 million into Exploring for the Future—$125 million most recently. Exploring for the Future will ensure that, as we move forward, there are opportunities for additional exploration so that we can identify more resources, find more jobs and open up places like the Beetaloo Basin. We have put out a strategic basin plan for the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory, the hottest play on the planet, with over $200 million committed from us already. That includes infrastructure like roads. That includes putting forward $50 million to ensure that exploration occurs earlier, not later, so we can get this gas into our systems as soon as we possibly can. So there are opportunities for the resources sector. There are opportunities for more jobs in our sector. There are opportunities for us to continue growth and continue to contribute to the Australian economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asked about alternatives and whether there are any alternatives. We know that those opposite are having a go each way, but that has become no way. They are not supporting offshore oil and gas. They are not supporting gas. They are not supporting coal. They are not supporting those hardworking men and women who are out there in the resources sector every single day putting money into our economy, putting royalties into the bank and ensuring that the essential services that Australians rely on can be paid for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are opportunities into the future. We will ensure they are developed. We will ensure that people have a job. We will ensure that, in the member for Dawson's electorate, there will be even more opportunities than there are right now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Australians</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  Thank you, Member for Braddon, for your question. It's a good question, because I heard you this morning deliver a speech in this chamber and I saw the very affectionate and warm response from Dr Emma Lee, who is an Indigenous anthropologist. She appreciated the fact that you acknowledged the history of the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Member for Barton, when you were reading that extract out of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report this morning, what it made me do was reflect: what are we doing for young people? Your point is very strong in terms of cultural identity. At the girls academies, we've increased the number of places from 2,900 by an additional 2,700. That allows young women to come together within those academies to look at their academic pathways and, at the same time, share cultural strength and identity. We do the same for the Clontarf boys. Those programs underpin the ongoing credentialing into adulthood by the supportive nature that exists within them. In addition to that, it is about building hope and building an opportunity for them to go on to other places that they aspire to in their lives. I've been to many of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Closing the Gap strategy this time round has a target on out-of-home care which will really test every system on the placement of Indigenous children taken to out-of-home care programs. Family violence—these are all key initiatives within closing the gap, but we are doing it on a co-design basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the PM first said to me, 'You'll work with 50 organisations,' I frowned at him and said: 'You're asking me to do an incredible challenge. If you know the politics of our community, that's hard work.' But by co-designing we now have ownership between the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and Indigenous Australians. So it augurs well for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're working with SNAICC to develop an early childhood strategy, which I negotiated in early days with the Prime Minister. That is now bringing together the fundamental tenets of good early years in life and better opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to build on all of our work and continue to focus on the history of the past in order to make the future better. To all of you in this chamber, I thank you for the commitment you give to Indigenous Australians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">The SPEAKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  I have a short statement to provide some information to members. As many of you would know, shortly after the House rose last year, our Deputy Clerk, Catherine Cornish, made known her intention to retire. Those of you who have worked closely with Catherine will not be surprised that it was her wish to make a quiet departure, but I thought it appropriate for the House to formally acknowledge her many years of expert support, guidance and advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Catherine joined the Department of the House of Representatives in April 1994, working first in the Committee Office. As her parliamentary career progressed, Catherine led the Table Office and then the Procedure Office before her appointment as Deputy Clerk in 2019. She has been the consummate professional, respected by members and staff alike. For many years, Catherine has made a strong procedural contribution to the work of the House, most visibly in her role as Clerk at the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps not as visibly, for some 20 years Catherine has also made a significant contribution for members and staff in parliamentary knowledge-sharing and capacity-building. The capacity-building aspect of Catherine's work extended to members and staff of developing parliaments around the globe through work here and at those other parliaments, including in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. In recent years, Catherine has been a guiding hand for a new suite of procedural resources and programs, not only for this House but also in support of Pacific parliaments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Catherine will shortly embark on her retirement, I know members will join me in thanking her for her years of dedicated service to the House and to the parliament.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  It's a pleasure to be able to stand and speak on the Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response No. 2) Bill 2020, which is part of the package this government is delivering on the recommendations of the Hayne royal commission since its report was handed down a couple of years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there's a lot of colour and light going on on the opposition benches, a bit of ranting and raving because they're saying, 'Why weren't the bills introduced and legislated earlier?' There was this thing called COVID-19. I'm not sure if you're familiar in it. Early last year there was—and we're still getting to the bottom of the origins, but most people think it came from Wuhan in China—a virus and it distracted the political discussion and the priorities of governments, not just in Australia but all around the world. We had this reprioritisation to say, yes, these sorts of urgent reforms matter, but saving human lives, protecting the Australian community, making sure we had the necessary health systems and making sure we provided the economic support measures to make sure people didn't lose jobs all mattered a bit more. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The confected outrage of those members on the opposition benches falls a bit flat because what we're doing—now that the Treasury has the bandwidth, the government has the bandwidth and, frankly, this parliament has the bandwidth—is getting on with the job so that we can make sure that Australian consumers are protected. The role of financial services is to manage and create the wealth of our great nation, but to do it in alignment with those who own that wealth. Of course, we've had reforms already, and there are many reforms to go. But there are other things that we need to focus on as well as a consequence of the Hayne royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is relatively straightforward. It's to make sure that financial advisers' interests are aligned with the interests of the people that they're advising. You would have thought this was self-evident for financial advisers and that, when they clip the ticket because they provide a service which is entirely reasonable and fair, they do it on the basis that they are actually helping the people who are gaining a benefit from their services. Their interests should be in alignment and not in contrast. When fees are being charged—as clearly has occurred with some financial advisers—against the interests of their customers, they are being rorted of their savings and investments because people are using it as an opportunity to mine for fees and their own interests. If financial advisers are doing that, they should be held to account. That's what this legislative proposal goes part way to addressing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should never turn a blind eye when we find this happening in other places. As you would be aware, Deputy Speaker, I am the chair of the Standing Committee on Economics. We are running a term-long inquiry at the request of the Treasurer into the implementation of the Hayne royal commission. The member for Dunkley probably wasn't on the committee when we discovered some super funds were also charging members fees without providing a service. The only response from the opposition to this fee-for-no-service moment was to run interference and to distract from what was going on, and we wonder why. It might be because it was being done by their friends in the industry super fund ecosystem. They were actually caught red-handed reactivating low balance inactive accounts—which, by law, should have gone to the Australian Taxation Office—so that they could harvest them for fees and insurance people didn't want or need because it could underwrite their profitability. It is the most despicable thing, in exactly the same way financial advisers have been caught out by the Hayne royal commission. Hayne missed this one and we have done something about it despite the efforts of the opposition. In the end, fees for no service is wrong, and it doesn't matter whether it's a financial adviser or an industry super fund. When they're caught red-handed, they're culpable and we need to make sure we change the law to protect people. This shows a fundamental blind spot of the opposition around financial services. Their interest is not in stopping wrongdoing; their interest is what they can gain from it, like the dodgy financial advisers that this bill is stopping. That's what we discovered in the Economics Committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also seeing it in their behaviour around so many other issues around financial advice and prioritisation. Just before question time, I drew an explicit contrast between the rhetoric of the Labor Party and the opposition and what they do. I'll repeat it just for clarity: when it comes to Labor, it's always 'them first, you last'. At the last election, Labor said negative gearing cost housing affordability. That was their big narrative. That's what they do. They conned millions of Australians into believing this lie, but they knew it wasn't true. Yesterday in the Nine press, Labor MPs backgrounded that by saying in relation to scrapping negative gearing, 'For the amount of money it raises versus the political pain, it's just not worth it.' Clearly, their only priority is not housing affordability and it's not improving the homeownership rate of young Australians; it's merely their take of your money. Either housing affordability matters but they'd rather have votes, or it doesn't and they just want your cash. It's 'Labor first, you last'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now they're doing the same thing with super. Since the 1990s, Labor has championed taking workers' wages to stop them saving a deposit to own their own home. Unsurprisingly, homeownership rates amongst young Australians have declined while Labor has been prioritising super ahead of homeownership. The average age to buy a first home has now blown out to 36. Labor's solution is to double down and make it harder for you, the people of Australia, to save. Labor want a nation of renters because homeownership gets in the way of handing moolah to their mates. Liberals want you to own your future—your security for you and your family. Liberals want a nation of homeowners. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first time we've had this debate. At the end of the Second World War, most people remember the divide between Chifley's Labor Party and Menzies's Liberal Party as being about bank nationalisation, but go back to the speeches and look at one of the other critical divides. Labor wanted to use federal state housing agreements to create a nation of dependent renters where people were denied the dignity of ownership of their own homes. Menzies was committed, and our party has been committed at every point, to the democratisation of wealth creation and distribution through the power of homeownership. We did it in 1949 and we drew a line in the sand. It's hardly a shock that, for many years after that, the Australian people never forgot the Labor Party's and the opposition's betrayal of Australians' aspirations to own their own home. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Liberals want you to own your future. Super matters but homeownership matters more; it should be 'home first, super second'. The only people who want to obsessively argue against it are the people who have their interests in the till of keeping the super system prioritised ahead of homeownership. That's why it's wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that a lot of members of the opposition find it outrageous that someone would dare say that homeownership matters more than super. There's such a con at the heart of their argument. They have no issue with your super being used to invest in build-to-rent housing, so super funds will own housing stock with your money and they will say that you must rent it from them. That is a betrayal of the Australian social contract. It is a disgrace, and they sit there on the other side of the chamber and applaud it along. The idea that you would rent off your own super fund, from your own money, is despicable, but that is where the Australian super system is heading: to create a neo-feudalism at the heart of Australian society, where young Australians, new Australians, migrant workers and low-income workers will be denied their own dream, to serve the interests of super funds and be serfs to their own super, rather than having the dignity, the pride and the ownership they'd have not just of their own home but of this great country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there's a mocking dismissal by members of the opposition, but that is where their priorities sit in the financial services sector: Labor first, you last. They've taken that attitude in the economics committee, they take that attitude in this parliament and they continue to mock and deride the opportunity for young Australians to be able to own their own home. It's a disgrace. They can't see it, because they're blind, because at the heart of these debates they see themselves and their interests, not the opportunities for you, the people of Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So in this piece of legislation we are taking sensible action to make sure that financial advisers don't rip off customers. We've already done the same where we found industry super funds ripping off fund members and those with low-balance accounts, sometimes the most underprivileged low-income Australians. But again the member for Dunkley simply shrugs her shoulders at the rip-offs of industry super against nurses and teachers and those people who've made the effort to be able to save for their own dignity. Now give them the choice, the opportunity to empower themselves. Give them the opportunity to be able to use their savings, their money, their effort and their reward to own their own home. Instead we'll get the sneering arrogance of the opposition in opposing it every step of the way. My response is: bring this fight on, because it should be home first, super second. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  It's difficult to know where to start when you have such an unhinged, breathless, desperate attempt to distract from the fact that those opposite have been running a protection racket on the rorts and rip-offs in the banking system for some years. Those opposite, time and time again, have been given opportunity after opportunity to say something about the rorts and rip-offs that made this banking royal commission necessary in the first place. There's been not a word from those opposite about cases such as that of a young man with Down syndrome who was forced into purchasing life insurance he could never benefit from, or about charging dead people for financial advice, or about shoving clients into high-risk, low-quality products. There's been not a word about case after case after case which we heard about before the royal commission and during the royal commission and which made the royal commission itself necessary. I think that speaks volumes about those opposite and the fact that they will always side with the big banks and the big financial institutions against the interests of ordinary working people. That's why we had the protection racket for so many years, and I'll come to that in a moment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation before the House, the Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response No. 2) Bill 2020, is about the implementation of some of the recommendations of the Hayne royal commission. It contains three schedules, which implement four different recommendations made by Commissioner Hayne in relation to aspects of financial advice. Labor will be supporting the passage of the legislation, but I'm also proud to move the second reading amendment circulated under my colleague the member for Whitlam's name and to speak in favour of that amendment. I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation goes to the core of the delays that we have seen in the implementation of the Hayne royal commission recommendations. What is says and what it shows is just how little those opposite's heart is really in the implementation of this. The last time this parliament sat we saw the two-year anniversary of the handing over of the Hayne royal commission recommendations and still only something like one-third of the 76 recommendations have been fully implemented by those opposite. That does speak volumes about a government long on announcements but short on delivery. It was two years on that day since that awkward photo-op where the Treasurer was sitting, all grins, begging Commissioner Hayne to smile or shake his hand. There was a look of disdain on the commissioner's face as he handed over this royal commission report. It says everything about the government: they put all the planning in the photo-op. You don't have to scratch the surface of the Treasurer too much before you'll interest him in a photo-op. Here he is with Commissioner Hayne in this awkward hostage situation of the handing over of the report. In the two years since that moment only a third of the recommendations of the royal commission have actually been fully implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has a history—and I'm pleased the member for McMahon is at the table as well, because it was almost five years ago in April, after listening to and consulting with the victims of misconduct in the financial system, that I, the member for McMahon, the member for Isaacs and the member for Maribyrnong stood up in Melbourne and said: 'Enough is enough. What's necessary here is a royal commission to get to the bottom of these rorts and rip-offs so that we can get justice for the victims of what's gone on here.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From that moment forward, for two full years, those opposite ran a protection racket against that banking royal commission. Twenty-six times the Prime Minister voted against having a royal commission into the banks. Despite the overwhelming evidence of banking misconduct, despite all of the stories day after day of rorts and rip-offs in the banking system, those opposite ran a protection racket. You know what changed their mind? The member for Whitlam and the member for McMahon will remember this. It wasn't that there'd been a particularly impactful story or case that had come to light; it was because they got a permission slip from the banks. They got a letter from the banks saying, 'Okay, look, you know what, it's probably okay if you agree to a royal commission.' Armed with that little permission slip, they announced a banking royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout that period, from that moment until the 2019 election, they went all around the country and said: 'We're really serious about this. We will implement quickly the recommendations of the banking royal commission.' They cried crocodile tears for the victims. All over Australia, in every electorate of Australia, they pretended to care about implementing the royal commission recommendations. As soon as they were through that election, we got excuse after excuse for delay, and that's what we're seeing here. It's been more than two years now since the recommendations were handed over and only a third of the recommendations have been put in place, and that shows that, if the people of this country want a federal government, a national government, on their side when it comes to looking after their interests in the financial system of this country, then only Labor will provide that kind of government. What those opposite have shown for the last five years or more—for much longer than that, but in this case for the last five years or so—is that they have absolutely no interest in protecting the welfare of the Australian people in the banking system. Instead, they've spent the bulk of the last five years running that protection racket for the big banks. They will always side with the big banks against the interests of ordinary working people in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian has an interest in us having a robust, competitive and profitable financial system that works well. It's such an important part of our economy. We want to have a well-functioning financial system. We want the banks to be profitable on the basis of providing good services, not cutting corners. It's really key, as we emerge from the deepest, most damaging recession in almost a century, that we get the financial system working right, but we won't do and we won't give the Australian people the confidence that they need to have in their banks unless and until we implement these recommendations properly so that people can have confidence that the political world, the government here in Canberra, has listened to what's happened, taken the recommendations seriously and implemented them afterwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the absence of that, people will conclude with some justification not just that the government are not on their side when it comes to rorts and rip-offs in the banking system but also that those opposite never intended to take it seriously and, until they do take it seriously, there will be a cloud hanging over the financial system. We don't want that. We as a country want to move forward with confidence. We want finance to flow freely in our economy and in our communities. We want all of that to happen. But, for that to happen, those opposite need to drop the habit of a lifetime and actually care about the welfare of ordinary Australians, ordinary working families, the people of Middle Australia in the banking system, who have been treated in some instances very shabbily in the recent past. Those opposite need to represent their interests and not just the interests of the banks.</span>

Even before the report of the financial services royal commission was handed down, these advisers reached out to me to help me understand their sector, the benefits that advisers deliver and the challenges that their industry faces. I've been determined to ensure that these concerns are heard and that, in ensuring that the public are protected from malpractice, the government delivers targeted, effective regulations without adding unnecessary red tape.</span>

In February 2019, I met with some 50 mortgage brokers in Mooloolaba, while in October 2019 I spoke with another 25 financial advisers. Between those times and now, I've had many further discussions with individual financial planners all over the coast and even presented to the local financial planners association early last year.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've written to the Treasurer and to the minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and the Digital Economy on these issues, and I'm grateful to both of them for the serious consideration they have given to the concerns of my constituents and their businesses. Indeed, the minister for financial services has met with me many times on these questions and even took the time herself in July 2019 to come to Fisher and speak with local financial planners. I know that they appreciated the opportunity to be heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial planners have raised with me the question of the tax deductibility of financial advice. They've raised increases in ASIC charges for self-managed superannuation fund auditors and financial advisers. They've expressed disappointment at the new education requirements for experienced financial advisers and made me aware that some in the sector want an extension of grandfathered conflicted remuneration. Sunshine Coast financial advisers spoke to me about increasing regulatory costs, professional indemnity costs and the incongruity of third-party licensing in light of the royal commission's findings. In general, time and again they have highlighted to me the importance of ensuring that small, family owned businesses in this sector do not take the fall for the bad behaviour of large financial institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is really apt at this point to point out that those members opposite, those in the Labor Party, when they talk about the big banks and the Hayne royal commission, are oblivious to the impacts of the Hayne royal commission on small mum-and-dad financial planners. They talk about the terrible ills that the banks have perpetrated on Australians, and they were wrong, but what about the small, independent, mum-and-dad business operations that have worked in this industry for years and years? Without any form of discredit on themselves, those members opposite continuously talk about the big banks but you will never hear them talk about the small businesses that have been impacted. Now, I don't profess to be an expert in this field, but I do understand the importance of business and of the issues we're talking about, and I know that the minister appreciates them as well. Many of these questions have no easy solution. In every case a delicate balance must be struck between preventing a repeat of these bad practices that have gone on before and ensuring a strong sector that can serve those who'll need it most in the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House today is another important step in striking that critical balance. This government understands there will always be a market for good, professional, sound financial advice. ASIC, after all, found the majority of consumers who seek financial advice do so because they feel advisers could recommend products that they could not find on their own. I know the government also understands that, from its beginnings in the insurance sales industry, in recent years, the financial advice sector has been moving closer to what the public are demanding it become—that is, a more professional sector akin to medicine and the law. I'm pleased to say that not one financial adviser I have met has quibbled with me about that very fundamental need—that is, the need for them to become more professional. However, given the important role these advisers play in our financial sector, self-directed improvement is no longer enough, and it is critical that the industry is held to the highest of standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the light of the royal commission's findings, we must eliminate any misconduct. That's why the government committed to the Australian public to act on every one of Commissioner Hayne's 76 recommendations before the last federal election. It is an important matter of trust that, in this place, we live up to the commitment that we have made to the Australian people. To date, I believe the government has done so, while taking into account financial advisers' legitimate concerns. For example, in keeping with the royal commission's findings, the government has introduced a minimum educational requirement and an exam to ensure that, like doctors and lawyers, everyone in the sector has the same defined body of baseline knowledge, regardless of whether or not they have specialised during their career.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're ensuring that every adviser in the country has the complete body of knowledge which underpins the profession and the professionals' capacity to competently and ethically practice. However, we have balanced this with the proper recognition that the experience of advisers should also be taken into account. That is why the government has stipulated that existing advisers need only complete an eight-subject graduate diploma rather than a full 24-subject bachelor's degree. In addition, the government has recognised that existing advisers need more time to meet these new standards. With the urging of many members on this side of the House, the government has introduced legislation, which means that existing advisers will have until 1 January 2026—that's two additional years—to meet the qualification requirements and one additional year until 1 January 2022 to complete their exam.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Minister Hume for listening to me and my colleagues and stakeholders on these very important issues. The reforms in the bill before the House today are similarly effective in striking that balance. It is vitally important that there is transparency and clarity for consumers around fees when it comes to financial advice. We want to avoid the fee-for-no-service conduct we've seen in the past. However, just as importantly, we must not add unduly to the reams of paper that financial advisers are already required to provide to their clients when delivering any services. I'm sure we have all had the discouraging experience of being handed a thick wad of legal papers to read before purchasing a service we want and need. It is a simple fact of human nature that the greater bulk of fine print we are given to read, the less likely we are to read it and take it all in. How many Australians read the fine print when we're asked to agree to terms and conditions by Apple, for example? They provide reams and reams—in that case, electronic reams—of material. The more you provide and the more complex you make it, the less people will read it, and if people don't read it they will come unstuck. The more complicated we make the compliance for the adviser, the greater the risk for the consumer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the reforms in this bill, financial advisers would be required to provide clients with a fee disclosure statement every year, which would detail the fees to be charged in the following 12 months and the services that the client is entitled to receive during that period. Critically, the bill would also require that clients provide active written consent to those fee arrangements going ahead, before any fees are charged. This will ensure the transparency that consumers need. However, just as important, under this bill these fee disclosure statements would take the form of a single document, delivered annually at a predictable time. The bill also removes the current requirement for financial advisers to provide a renewal notice to their clients. Both the disclosure statement and the request for renewal would be outlined in one straightforward document under this bill, preventing unnecessary duplication. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, this bill provides for critical transparency by requiring financial advisers who are not independent, impartial or unbiased, as defined under the Corporations Act, to declare as much in a written statement to all clients before providing them with any advice. Failure to do so will incur a substantial civil penalty of up to three times the benefit derived or 5,000 penalty units. However, once again the bill prevents duplication by requiring the statement to be provided as part of the existing financial services guide, which is already mandatory in most financial advice arrangements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, under the reforms in this bill, unnecessary and unwanted ongoing advice fees from MySuper products will be prohibited, stamping out one of the more common fee-for-no-service arrangements identified by the royal commission. However, the government recognises that some members will want to see further financial advice, especially as they are approaching retirement. As such, the bill allows for non-ongoing fees to be charged where the individual gives their explicit consent. In each of its three schedules, this bill delivers on the financial services royal commission's recommendations and ensures that consumers have the protection they need. In each case, the schedules do this while listening to the industry and preventing the unnecessary duplication and bureaucracy which are making it increasingly difficult for advisers to service clients with lower value asset pools. That point was made continually to me by the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The financial advice sector delivers much-needed services to every corner of the country and impacts the lives of every Australian in some way. The government's reforms are not just change for change's sake. They will make our financial system more efficient, more competitive and more trusted, for the benefit of all Australians. I know that many of the financial advisers in Fisher will remain concerned for their lower value portfolio clients. I understand they will remain concerned about their ability to service these clients whilst staying compliant with their new regulatory obligations. However, these changes are necessary to protect the public, and they are very timely. They are the right thing to do for the public and for the industry. In my experience with dealing with financial advisers, I've learnt that as a profession they are excellent at adaptation. They have had to be. This process will be no different. Strengthening the sector will benefit all Australians, as they will be able to access better quality advice that is affordable and helps them make good financial decisions. Strengthening these protections will ensure that Australians are receiving the best possible guidance. Ultimately, the reforms in this bill and all of those in the government's financial sector reform package are going to result in greater consumer confidence in the financial services industry and support the sector's ongoing place in our society in the years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will continue to work with financial advisers to consult. I will listen to their concerns and ensure that this government gets the balance right between the interests of consumers and those of their financial advisers. Members opposite continually talk about the big banks, but they always forget small business. Members of this government, the Morrison government, never forget small business. Small business runs through our veins. Most of us come from small business. We know what it's like to have to meet payroll on Thursday. We come into this place with that responsibility. We look at bills through that prism. We will continue to do so, and I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  The speaker before me made the assertion that Labor never talks about small business. Let me start my contribution on the Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response No. 2) Bill 2020 by talking about not just a small business but the human beings behind that small business, whose financial interests, health and welfare have been devastated by the action of a bank and the failure of this government to make sure processes are in place so they get proper restitution. It's a shame that the member who spoke before me has walked out as I rise to speak on the subject that he said no-one from Labor ever speaks on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My constituents Mr and Mrs Furneaux, small-business people, had a business loan from the NAB of about $240,000 in September 2006. They started to struggle with the behaviour of the bank. It was an interest-only loan, and they thought that would continue for two years. Something happened. The banks said they weren't meeting their contractual arrangements, and they tried to negotiate with the bank about how to deal with it. They looked at their private properties and they looked at whatever they could do try to service their loan. The bank says they were served with a notice of default, but they never received it. That led to years and years of nightmare in the Supreme Court, trying to negotiate with the bank and trying to keep their heads above water. As a result of the way they were dealt with by the bank, they've lost both of their residential properties and their business. The Furneauxs aren't people who are just complaining because their business has failed; they're people who have been doing everything right to try to get a resolution for this problem with the bank. They haven't had any help from AFCA. The negotiations with the bank, which were supposed to be done in good faith, fell through. They don't know what to do now. They've pleaded with me to raise it in this parliament as an example of victims of bank misconduct who to this day, in 2021, are still struggling for an outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're not the only constituents of mine who have complained about their dealings with AFCA. Stephen has contacted me a number of times. As he said to me in one of his most recent emails: 'It's very disappointing that a government agency is so unhelpful and unable to do what it is meant to do. It's past time when more action is needed. I've done all I can and I need assistance.' AFCA's caused a lot of extra work for all involved, with significant delays. It's a matter that has been before them for many months, and the delay is entirely due to AFCA, but Stephen said he is given just seven days to reply. He can't get the help he needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's about time this government looked at what is happening at AFCA. It's interesting that the current chair of AFCA is also the chair of Crown. Perhaps it's about time the government took an approach to dealing with institutions and appointments that is something other than jobs for former Liberal politicians or their mates. It's also time this government told the truth about its lack of implementation of the recommendations of the royal commission. After voting against the royal commission 26 times, the government finally bowed to pressure and introduced a royal commission into banking and financial institutions. I don't think anyone in Australia can forget the image of the Treasurer trying to shake Commissioner Hayne's hand when the recommendations were handed down, or his Academy-Award-winning performance of outrage at the way hardworking Australians had been treated by the banks—his scathing assessment of the banks' behaviour. The Treasurer of Australia said the banks were driven by a culture of greed that breached the law and the price paid by the community was immense. The Treasurer spoke of the broken businesses, the emotional stress and the personal pain of thousands of victims, and he promised change. That is what he promised the Australian people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know: 'There was COVID. Doesn't everybody know there was COVID?' According to the member for Goldstein, in his hyperbolic and tremendously loud contribution to this debate, that meant the government was focused on other things. Apart from the things that this parliament supported and that went through, like JobKeeper and JobSeeker and JobMaker, he didn't really say what else the government was focused on. He didn't, for example, highlight that the government was focused on doing the exact opposite of recommendation 1 of the royal commission, which is to keep the responsible lending laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently, all of last year, for the times that the government didn't cancel parliament and parliament was actually sitting, the government was able to bring in legislation to establish an integrity commission for cheaters at university, because that was urgent, as opposed to an integrity commission for this parliament and the Public Service. So they could do that. They could bring in legislation which changed the fees for courses at universities, which has the impact of making it harder for students and young people from poorer families to go to university because they can't afford to leave with a $50,000 debt. The government could do that last year. It could introduce substandard environmental protection laws. It could introduce legislation which established a pale alternative to a royal commission into veteran suicides, which is what the defence community would like. It could introduce legislation to extend the racist cashless welfare card system onto more vulnerable Australian people. This parliament considered 181 pieces of legislation last year, including private member's bills, which, fair enough, by the standards of what the previous Labor government was able to do during the global financial crisis, is pretty poor. It could introduce 181 pieces of legislation but couldn't focus on implementing the recommendations of the royal commission into banks and financial institutions. That's the real measure of this government's commitment to making banks follow the law and protecting Australian small businesses and individuals who have been the victims of malpractice. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just mentioned the member for Goldstein—and I know he's not in the chamber, but I'm sure he is sitting avidly watching my contribution. I want to put in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> that he noted that at one point, during his contribution, my shoulders were shaking. It's true: they were. But not for the reasons the member for Goldstein suggested. I was just trying to get the ringing out of my ears that was caused by the volume of his contribution. I would suggest that, if it's possible, Hansard records that contribution, as I've suggested previous speeches, be recorded in capital letters. Maybe they want to put the one delivered today in bold and italics. I don't know how you're going to record the hyperventilating in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>—I'll leave that up to the experts. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation introduces reforms which are needed and which are supported. There is no doubt about that. They are overdue, but it's good that they are happening now. What needs to happen is more of an actual commitment. We heard horrific stories from person after person after person who went before the royal commission and bared their lives with some of the most devastating experiences they have ever had to go through in the hope not only that would they get some recompense but that it wouldn't happen to anyone else. We need to honour what they did for the rest of the community and the work that the royal commissioner and everyone at the royal commission put in with the recommendations and get them implemented. The way to do that is not to strip away responsible lending laws. The way to do that is not to blame having to deal with COVID—which, by the way, the states did a lot of, but that's another speech. The way to do that is for the Treasurer to do his job. There are a lot of recommendations outstanding, and I look forward to the flurry of legislation that must be about to come to implement them. Thank you.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  It's interesting listening to the member for Dunkley's contribution and I would agree with her on one point: the behaviour of the banks, particularly during the GFC, that ultimately led to the royal commission was reprehensible. As somebody who spent a career in the banking and financial services sector before coming to this place, it was extraordinarily disappointing that the banks didn't take in a professional manner their social responsibility and social license to look after their customers and assist them through an extraordinarily difficult time. That it had to get to a royal commission for some of those issues to be ventilated and articulated was equally disappointing. But the member for Dunkley's contribution also demonstrates my concern with those opposite and their complete and utter lack or apparent lack of an understanding of the financial services industry, particularly the advice part of that industry. Nothing in the member for Dunkley's contribution spoke to the substantive matters in this legislation, and it didn't demonstrate that she even understands the industry that we're talking about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I am pleased to see is, over the last 12 or 18 months since the royal commission, a move by the big banks to divest themselves of their financing planning arms. I've long held the view that if you provide financial planning advice you should not be able to be owned—or you should not be owned, full stop—by a product manufacturer, whether that's a bank, whether that's an insurance company or whether that's a fund manager, and even whether that's an industry super fund because they are also, ultimately, a product manufacturer. Advice should be completely separate from the people who create the products that advisers recommend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The important part of this equation that gets overlooked is that advisers can only recommend a suite of products as per their approved product list. But there are professional advisers out there—and there are a great many. The vast majority of the industry are professional advisers who have been in the industry for 20 or 30 years or longer and have had clients who have been with them for that whole journey. It's a completely and utterly different model from the sales model that existed within the financial planning arms of the big institutional banks, in particular, and AMP. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those people, the professional advisers who have run their own businesses for the past 20 or 30 years or longer, who deal with ordinary Australians each and every day and work with them to ensure that their financial goals and objectives are realised, that their wealth is protected and that they are able to achieve their retirement goals, focus not on the product. The most important part of the advice that they provide is the strategic advice that is designed to assist everyday Australians meet their goals and objectives. This is whether it's getting a mortgage paid down, whether it's saving or accumulating X amount for retirement, whether it's accumulating an investment portfolio within super or outside super or a combination of the two, or whether it's ensuring they've got the right mix in structure of insurance policies, both to protect their own personal wealth that has accumulated and their family's wealth should something unfortunate happen to them. But also, if they're in a business and have a business partnership, it's to ensure that they have the right structure of insurance products to fund their buy-sell agreements or their exit strategy should something happen to them. There are a whole range of pieces of strategic advice that professional advisers, outside of the banks, provide each and every day to Australians. They're the people I focus on, each and every day, because the majority of these people are small-business owners. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the point the member for Fisher was trying to make, in his contribution, that the member for Dunkley completely missed in her contribution. The member for Fisher was speaking about mum-and-dad Australians who have their own small businesses providing professional financial advice to other mum-and-dad Australians. They're the people who go out there each and every day and, just like the small-business owner the member for Dunkley referred to that the banks treated so shabbily and who has put all of their assets on the line every day, it is the same for these individual advisers and their small businesses. They do exactly the same thing. Their family's wealth is based on the value of the client relationships that they work on, based on the professional advice that they provide in a variety of areas. This is where this piece of legislation is so important, in that it seeks to ensure that we improve the level of disclosure with regard to the fees that advisers are charging their clients. This is critically important because it is important to ensure that there is complete transparency about the fees that an adviser is charging on an upfront basis but also on an ongoing basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, much of the fee-for-no-service issue that we saw out of the royal commission came from the big institutional players at that point in time. We heard very few if any instances of fees for no service for small to medium-sized financial planning firms that actually take the time and the effort, each and every day, to look after their clients. That's not to say that, within that part of the financial services sector, there aren't people who do the wrong thing. We should have a suite of legislation. And ASIC also, in doing their role, should ensure that those people are removed from the industry. I have no argument with that whatsoever. We do not want people in the industry who are not going to put the best interests of their clients first. They have a legislated responsibility to do that. Even before that, most of the professional advisers did that. Sadly, there are those that didn't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is focused on improving that disclosure but also, at the same time, ensuring that what was potentially three documents that you had to give to your client is now a single document. We know, from the research and work done, that the more paperwork we give clients—and this was a piece of work that ASIC did a number of years ago—the less likely it is that clients actually read that paperwork. What we actually want is for clients to read the documentation that they are given so that they understand what they're paying for, what they're receiving and what the services are that they expect to receive as a result of the ongoing fees that they are paying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the member for Fisher, I frequently meet with financial advisers, both in my electorate and more broadly, and we discuss these issues. I accept there's stuff in here that some in the industry would want to go further with. However, the reality is that these protections being put in place are designed to protect consumers, and the reason we need this legislation is that we have seen that there are those who don't put consumers before their own interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The important part of this legislation, though, in trying to take three documents and put them into one, is that also it helps mitigate one of the big issues that has faced the industry over the last few years, and that is the cost of the provision of advice. I acknowledge the work that ASIC is doing to try and understand how we can reduce the cost of advice so it's more affordable for a broader range of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I commend this bill to the House, in its unamended form—because, as usual, those opposite have chucked in a few pious amendments. This bill, in schedule 1, will improve the disclosure by advisers for the personal advice that they provide to their clients under the ongoing fee arrangement. It also provides a degree of flexibility to the provision of the financial disclosure statement, and that's important because, whilst it sets a fixed anniversary date for their clients, we all know that clients' circumstances are not set in stone and that their circumstances might change or they might need to see advisers at different times of the year. But it's important that, in the totality of the service that is provided over the course of the year, the clients receive the services that the adviser says they're going to provide and that the fees charged are appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new requirements will ensure clients are given a more frequent opportunity to opt in. In the current regime it is two years; it will go to an annual opt-in. That can be in hard copy but, importantly, it can also be in electronic form. So it creates some flexibility in how that written consent can be provided to the adviser and, subsequently, by the adviser to the fund manager, so that the fund manager has clear evidentiary documentation that those fees can be charged. These changes come in from 1 July 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other changes, which are equally important, include the disclosure around independence and any conflicts of interest. If nothing else, that's one of the things that came out of the royal commission—that lack of disclosure of a lack of independence, particularly by advisers within the bank network and their own adviser groups; people not understanding those links; and the consequent impact of the products that were recommended as a result. I think that is a good clarifying schedule in this bill. That makes the disclosure of independence more and more important. The last change relates to advice fees for MySuper products: where there's a specific piece of advice provided on a one-off basis, the fee for that advice can be charged from a MySuper product with the client's explicit consent, but ongoing advice fees cannot be so charged. There are a myriad of other methods by which they can be charged, though other investment accounts or via direct debit or other things. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I firmly believe that the financial advice industry is working towards becoming more professional and more transparent about what it does. It needs to do that to ensure there's the confidence in the Australian community for people to be able to go and get unbiased, independent advice. Importantly, that advice should be focused on the strategic needs of the client: what are their requirements to improve their wealth, protect their wealth or accumulate their wealth for the future? Once we get to an industry that focuses on those core needs and gives that strategic piece of advice properly, in a cost-effective manner that builds the wealth of everyday Australians, then we will have a professional industry. I look forward to seeing that day, but I commend this bill to the House as a step on the road to continuing to work with the industry to build that professional industry to provide professional advice to Australians of all parts of our country—those who have small account balances and those who have large account balances. This is the next step in what I think is a very good suite of legislation to come down the track. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  I rise to speak on the Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response No. 2) Bill 2020. The bill before the House alters the laws which guide professionals when they provide financial services to their customers. The passage of this bill will block banks from some of the pathways to customer mistreatment that they have previously taken. Specifically, this instrument seeks to limit the capacity of banks to charge fees for no service. The practice of charging without providing a service was aggressively highlighted through the banking royal commission. If passed, this draft legislation would require an annual review of fee arrangements and explicit disclosure of a lack of independence or conflict of interest where it exists. The financial sector reform bill also sets stringent demands on the timing of advice fees for superannuation members. These are good things. These changes will protect Australians from unjustifiable and immoral financial malpractice. The Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response No. 2) Bill is in keeping with recommendations made by the banking royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a problem: while the bill before this House suggests the government has engaged with the final report of the Hayne royal commission in good faith, the government's behaviour elsewhere shows the exact opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Supporting Economic Recovery) Bill 2020 is currently subject to a Senate inquiry due to report on 12 March this year. Schedule 1 of the national consumer protection amendment removes responsible lending obligations for most consumer credit contracts. Recommendation 1 of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry states that the National Consumer Credit Protection Act should not be altered to lessen the safeguards that ensure responsible lending. In simple terms, the first recommendation of the banking royal commission is to retain responsible lending laws. This government has introduced legislation to do just the opposite. It is truly mind-boggling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We currently have protections in our lending laws to make sure that loans are affordable, suitable and ethical. The Labor government introduced the National Consumer Credit Protection Act in 2009, and there were two key reasons for responsible lending laws. The first is that irresponsible lending leads to extremely personal hardship. This can arise with no fault by the borrower and is frequently linked to domestic abuse or other devastating life challenges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second reason is structural. Irresponsible lending introduces weaknesses into the economic system. Irresponsible lending generates bad debt. At low incidence, bad debt generates economic drag and lowers prosperity across the country. At moderate to high incidence, bad debt causes economic collapse and decimates prosperity across the country, the exact opposite of what we want during COVID. This is what we saw through the global financial crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Officials from this government's Treasury department sat before the banking royal commission and very clearly explained that the laws the government is now trying to cancel serve to protect our economy. The Labor government introduced the National Consumer Credit Protection Act in 2009 partly in response to the global financial crisis. It is incomprehensible to suggest that the draft legislation would have a positive impact on wellbeing or prosperity in Australia. It could not and it will not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two clients of my community law centre, the Barwon Community Legal Service, clearly show the absolute importance of retaining responsible lending requirements. Sally has two children to her de facto partner, John, who had a gambling problem and was very controlling with money. John wanted a new vehicle but his credit rating was poor and he was unable to get a loan. After several weeks of coercion, including physical and emotional violence, they went to a car dealership and John negotiated a purchase while Sally stayed outside. When it came time to sign the contract, John brought Sally into the store, explained to the car dealer that she would be the borrower and they proceeded to complete the paperwork, with Sally not asked one more question. That lender issued Sally a $25,000 loan at 20 per cent interest per annum via their own finance company. The car was registered in John's name and Sally never drove it. She only had her learner's permit. After they separated due to the ongoing family violence, John took the vehicle and left Sally with the debt. Barwon Community Legal Service assisted Sally to argue that the finance provider had breached responsible lending laws by not making inquiries or verifying information despite clear signs of coercion. Eventually, after making a complaint to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, the debt was waived. This waiver would not be possible and could not have been achieved without the responsible lending laws that this government intends to remove.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's Ahmed, another client of the Barwon Community Legal Service, who was deep in debt from business and personal loans and looking for a way out. He signed up for a course with a private college on the promise that he would earn an extra $1,000 a week after completing the qualification. When he couldn't afford course payments, they offered to organise finance for him. Ahmed got a phone call from someone who asked for all his bank statements and other details. The caller, a finance broker, connected to the college and applied for a loan on Ahmed's behalf at a rate of 22.9 per cent interest, using extremely inaccurate information. The course wasn't as advertised, and Ahmed was left with a loan of $30,000 to repay on top of all of his other debts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Barwon Community Legal Service stepped in and helped Ahmed make a complaint to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority on the grounds that both the broker and the lender breached the responsible lending laws. Ahmed eventually accepted a settlement from the finance broker. The lender wiped $22,000 of the debt and allowed him to repay the remainder at a rate he could afford, without interest. Like Sally, Ahmed is extremely thankful that Barwon Community Legal Service was able to advocate on his behalf. Without responsible lending laws, this would not have been possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the hugely committed team at Barwon Community Legal Service. The work they've done for Ahmed, Sally and thousands of others across my electorate is beyond commendable. They witness and fight the harm brought about by inappropriate lending practices and other social ills on a daily basis. In the last financial year Barwon Community Legal Service saved clients over $350,000 in waived, renegotiated or revoked debts arising from breaches of the very legislation this government is rushing to water down. They run a tanker ship on the smell of an oily rag and make our country a better, fairer and more compassionate place, so my heartfelt thanks go to the Barwon Community Legal Service. The Barwon Community Legal Service bears witness to the harm caused by irresponsible lending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury has testified to the significant and negative economic impact of responsible lending, but the Morrison government still has the gall to claim it will do Australians and the Australian economy good. Rubbish! We say no to any effort to strip back responsible lending. We say no to the Morrison government. We say no to the government's dodgy banker mates. Instead, we stand with Treasury and community legal services. We stand for the banking royal commission recommendations. We stand with Sally and Ahmed and every Australian who relies on every MP in this chamber to do the right and decent thing and protect them from harmful and irresponsible lending practices.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  Every Australian will rely on some form of financial services during their lifetime. Be it superannuation in their workplace, a life insurance policy, or advice from a bank when they are seeking to get a mortgage or a loan, everyone relies on financial services at some stage in their life. Unfortunately, for the past couple of decades in Australia, many Australians have been ripped off by dodgy practices and unconscionable conduct by people who had a power imbalance in their favour in the relationship between adviser and client in financial services. That, of course, led to the banking royal commission. That commission was resisted at every stage by those opposite in the early days. They didn't want to see the findings that were uncovered in the financial services royal commission come to light in Australia, because they knew that there were some bad practices going on. They were protecting their mates in the banking industry from having some of these insidious practices covered by not only the media but a royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That royal commission was very thorough and made a number of recommendations, and this bill delivers on some of those recommendations made by the Hayne royal commission. It contains three schedules which implement responses to four different recommendations made by Commissioner Hayne in relation to various aspects of financial advice. Schedule 1 relates to ongoing fee arrangements. This requires financial advisers to annually renew with their clients, through their express consent, the provision of those financial services. This comes about as a result of recommendation 2.1 of the royal commission, in which Commissioner Hayne recommended changes to fee renewal arrangements for financial advisers. Under the current law, these renewals can be taken biannually, and renewals are not required for pre-2013 arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw in the Hayne royal commission the result of that. One of the outcomes was that people were paying fees for no services, because they weren't sitting down on an annual or biannual basis with their financial adviser and going through the fees and commissions that were paid. They weren't seeing where their hard-earned money was going, in terms of those fees and commissions and renewing that advice for the next period of time. This recommendation deals with that, this legislative change deals with that and the proposed new law will require such renewal statements to include information about the service provided in the past year and the services that will be provided over the coming year, to make sure that there is more information and more transparency for people before they take on an advice relationship with a financial adviser in the future. That is a good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 relates to a disclosure of a lack of independence and will require financial advisers to provide written disclosure of a lack of independence to clients. This implements recommendation 2.2 of the royal commission, which recommended:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The law should be amended to require that a financial adviser who would contravene section 923A of the Corporations Act … must, before providing personal advice to a retail client, give to the client a written statement … explaining … why the adviser is not independent …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This, of course, came up in the royal commission on several occasions, these murky arrangements that were in place between financial advisers, some of the platform operators and the companies whose products the financial adviser would recommend to a particular client. The client would not be aware that that financial adviser may be getting a commission from promoting that particular product to them or may be getting some form of financial benefit from that ongoing relationship with a product provider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is important in these types of relationships, where there is a fiduciary duty to act in the interests of the client, is transparency, ensuring that those relationships are disclosed to the client and that they go in with open eyes before they sign on the dotted line and give their consent to that adviser acting on their behalf. That hasn't been happening in the industry. It's one of the areas that Hayne recommended in his report needs to be addressed. The current law only prohibits advisers calling themselves independent, unbiased or impartial in certain cases where they receive benefits from financial product providers, commissions, conflicted remuneration and other benefits. It does not require a positive declaration of the lack of independence, and under the proposed law ASIC will be required to determine the specific requirements for this disclosure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 relates to advice in superannuation. It increases restrictions around charging advice fees to a member of a superannuation fund. This implements the government's response to recommendations 3.2 and 3.3 of the financial services royal commission, which recommended that the government prohibit the deduction of advice fees, other than intrafund advice from MySuper products, and limit the deduction of advice fees from choice products. Many of the fee-for-no-service issues that were identified by Commissioner Hayne in the royal commission were in relation to retail superannuation fund providers—unfortunately, particularly AMP—charging advice fees to members. With many of those fees that were charged to those members, the member wasn't exactly aware that they were being charged. Across a particular platform and across a particular firm, this was happening on a regular basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This proposed law would prohibit superannuation trustees from charging members for advice without the express consent of the member. It would also prohibit superannuation trustees from charging ongoing advice fees to members of MySuper products. This doesn't prohibit superannuation trustees from charging one-off advice fees to MySuper members with their consent. It's worth noting that the proposed law differs from the recommendation made by Commissioner Hayne who recommended a strict prohibition on advice fees being charged to MySuper members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  The member for Oxley behind me says, 'It's the complete opposite.' It's worth noting that it differs from what Hayne recommended. Stakeholders in the superannuation sector, including the industry sector, are supportive of this model and it allows funds to provide advice to members in relation to key life events while prohibiting the provision of an ongoing fee for service. It later recommends that supporting this change in the provision of targeted advice at retirement with the consent of the member is likely to be beneficial to that member. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is important is that we have a retirement income system that provides dignity for workers in retirement. The basis upon which Australia's superannuation system was established was to provide dignity for workers in retirement. It's about government basically saying to workers: 'Over the course of your working life, you've worked hard. You've added to the economic growth of our country as an individual and collectively. And for that we'll support you in your retirement through a tax concession, for you to save during your working life and to enjoy the benefits of that retirement when you reach the preservation age. Then you can pay off your house. You can make sure that you can have a holiday every now and then, and you can look after your kids and your grandkids.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this government is attempting to undermine the notion of that dignity in retirement by attempting to look at cutting the legislated increase in superannuation that this parliament has committed to and this government has committed to on numerous occasions. During the last election campaign the Prime Minister gave a promise and commitment to the Australian people that his government would deliver a legislated increase in superannuation to 12 per cent for Australian workers. Now we see rumblings on their backbench and a number of members of this government starting to try and crab walk away from that commitment. They're even setting up websites, trying to harvest people's data, so they can run campaigns against the increase in superannuation that is legislated to occur for workers in Australia over the coming years. It is disgraceful because it's undermining retirement incomes for Australians but it's also a broken promise by this government to Australians in a very, very difficult time. In a time of a recession and coming out of it, the last thing you want to do is cut the retirement incomes of hardworking Australians and risk that dignity that they all deserve in retirement. That is exactly what this government is attempting to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many members on the government's backbench are attempting to undermine the commitment to increase the superannuation guarantee in Australia. What that will mean over time is that the average Australian worker retires with less in their superannuation account, which will make it more difficult for them to plan for their own retirement, save for their own retirement and fund their own retirement, and it will obviate the need for people to rely on the age pension. Why on earth with an ageing population in Australia would we want to bring in a policy that makes it more likely that more Australians are going to have to rely on the age pension in their retirement to fund their retirement? It will create a bigger impost on the Commonwealth budget at a time when we're now racking up a record debt under this government where debt is going to go through a trillion dollars, where the budget deficit is going to blow out to hundreds of billions of dollars. Why would you want to create and bake in a system that's going to see larger budget deficits into the future because Australians don't have the wherewithal and the necessary minimum superannuation guarantee to plan for their own retirement? It makes no economic sense whatsoever. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of this government in the House of Representatives and the Senate—all of us—get 15 per cent superannuation. So it's fine for us to pocket 15 per cent superannuation, but this government's saying: 'No, we don't want to increase the basic rate of superannuation savings to 12 per cent for the average worker over the course of the next few years.' That is hypocritical and despicable, and it is letting Australian workers down. It's breaking an election commitment that this government said was set in stone and that the Prime Minister himself, on numerous occasions during the election campaign, gave to the Australian working people. Well, this Labor Party will campaign against the breaking of that promise. We'll campaign against ensuring that this government can get away with cutting the retirement savings of the average Australian worker and with not meeting the commitment that they gave to Australian workers over the course of the last election campaign to increase their superannuation savings at what is a very, very difficult time for the average Australian worker. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, these reforms are important. They deliver on the Hayne royal commission's recommendations, particularly around providing transparency on advice that's given to clients before they sign up to a particular program of financial advice. But what is also important is making sure that Australians have the retirement incomes to be able to engage those financial advisers into the future, to plan for their retirement. If the government do get away with cutting the legislated increase in superannuation from 9½ to 12 per cent, they will be doing a very bad thing by the Australian people—by working Australians. They will again be breaking an election commitment. Labor will hold them to it and Labor will fight them every step of the way.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I rise to speak tonight on the Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response No. 2) Bill 2020. As we have heard, the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry was finalised on 1 February 2019. As we know, the government's response was publicly released alongside the final report on 4 February. In August 2019, the government indicated that the vast majority of legislation required to implement the FSRC's findings would be completed and introduced to parliament by the end of 2020. More than half of the recommendations made by the banking royal commissioner, Kenneth Hayne, either have been abandoned or are yet to be fully implemented. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, I want to spend some time on what that actually means and what the practical implications of that lack of reform have meant to the sector. I will be encouraging all members of the House to support the second reading amendment circulated in the name of the member for Whitlam and moved by the member for Rankin and particularly to recognise that these recommendations of the Hayne royal commission have taken far longer to be implemented than was promised and that the government have failed to establish a compensation scheme of last resort, as recommended by the Hayne royal commission, and have actively rejected the very first recommendation of the royal commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have a royal commission which the government—let's be honest—did not want. The inquiry and the royal commission into the banks was fought tooth and nail by every member of the government. The government were dragged kicking and screaming until we finally had justice for victims of the banking system in Australia. Then the very first recommendation has been rejected. In fact, by proposing to repeal the responsible lending obligations in the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 for the vast majority of credit contracts, the government is doing the complete opposite of what Commissioner Hayne recommended. I'll talk about that a little later in my remarks tonight, if time permits. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to focus now on what the government should have done—and, in my opinion, what the government still has time to do—in regard to the outrageous scourge of payday lending in this country: of vulnerable Australians being ripped off due to people making profits from those who can least afford it. This takes us to the government and its lack of action when it comes to the recommendations and policies that protect Australians around lending. The reckless behaviour of payday lenders has gone on long enough. I would take a bet that I have spoken more than anyone else about payday lending, in this parliament and the last parliament. I'd have to check the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, but I'd back myself in on that from about the end of 2016, after I visited St Ives Shopping Centre in Goodna. I was approached at Woolworths by about three or four really well-dressed ladies who were wearing badges. They were getting supplies from Woolworths for their op shop, and they came up to me and said, 'Oh, you're Milton Dick, aren't you?' I was newly elected and pretty impressed that they knew who I was. They read the riot act to me and said, 'What are you going to do about payday lending?' I said: 'What can I do? I've just been elected to the parliament.' They said: 'We are sick and tired of people coming to the St Alban's welfare ministries week after week with mounting debts. People are being tricked and conned into taking out payday loans. They are buying fridges, which should cost about $700 or $800, for $4,000 to $5,000. They are taking out loans to fix their cars for around $1,500, which ends up costing them $5,000.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I vowed from that moment onward that I would do everything I could to give justice to all of those people out in the community. When I looked into this a little further, I recognised that the then Turnbull government had planned to do something about it, and all credit to Kelly O'Dwyer in her former portfolio, as Minister for Revenue and Financial Services. She delivered a review with 20 recommendations, two of which would crack down on payday lending, one specifically to deal with household goods. The now Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Michael McCormack, stood in this chamber proudly as the then Minister for Small Business and said that he would deliver those reforms. He presented a draft exposure of a bill to do exactly what the government had promised to do with their own review. Then what happened? The 'parliamentary friends of payday lending' in the government got their hands on it and ripped it up, and we've heard nothing since. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then the Independents, Labor members of parliament and a whole range of stakeholders and individuals have stood up and said, 'Please take action.' The government have not heard their pleas. Between April 2016 and July 2019, just over 4.7 million individual payday loans have been written, worth approximately $3.09 billion. I realise this is big business, and I know some of those loan sharks will be monitoring this speech. Every time I speak about this they email me about the speech I've made and start trolling me on social media, which I wear as a badge of honour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years ago I did get a letter back from the then Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull—the only letter I've had personally addressed to me by a prime minister of this country—saying: 'Yes, we're going to take action. You've got my solemn commitment. I will take action. It will be delivered, and you can be part of that.' I've got it framed in my electorate office at Forest Lake. As the member for Barton said today, he was not interested in the credit; he was just interested in it actually happening. Two weeks later the members of the government rolled him. It was just that little bit too late. Since then I've written to minister after minister after minister over and over again. Hopefully, a ministerial adviser will be listening to this and adding it to their dart board in their offices yet again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know I speak for the people who have been ripped off. Around 15 per cent of payday loan borrowers end up in a debt spiral, which leads to events such as bankruptcy. I also speak tonight for the women who are accessing payday loans, the number of which has jumped by 28 per cent since 2016. Of course, we now know about the cycle of debt addiction that affects a lot of people who are being preyed upon because they are desperately in need of cash—because of insecure work, because of falling wages and because there are a million people unemployed. Eighty-six per cent of loans are now accessed through a website, on a mobile or a tablet. Just over the last couple of weeks, I've seen on my Facebook page—and residents have showed me on their Facebook pages—generous payday lenders offering to help with back-to-school products. They aren't helping with back-to-school products; they are offering a loan. They are offering a get-rich-quick scheme that's too good to be true, over and over again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Morrison government sit and do nothing—while it would be bad enough not to look at the small amount credit contract review, which they promised to do—they are now planning to make it easier for people to have access to unfair credit. They are seeing reforms being watered down—not recommended by the royal commission, not recommended by the royal commissioner himself, but in fact doing the opposite. So what does this all mean? What does it mean if these reforms happen? I refer to a media report in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> on Thursday 4 February entitled 'Australia risks household debt disaster if responsible lending laws scrapped'. It said that Australia's predatory lenders are set to see a household debt disaster—according to an alliance of consumer rights groups which I'm very proud to stand alongside. The media report said responsible lending obligations, as we know, were introduced in 2009 through the National Credit Protection Act, which attempted to stop risky lending by the banks. It said that the alliance—including a whole range of community organisations, financial counsellors and a number of great community advocates—said the inadequate consultation for a change is unacceptable and that 'this bill would only serve to extend the impacts of the economic downturn and it risks prolonging or worsening the financial hardship of Australians through bad debt in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, just as government supports such as JobKeeper and JobSeeker come to an end'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's bill will also make significant changes to the laws governing small amount credits, usually referred to as payday loans and consumer leases. What this really means is that a double whammy is coming to vulnerable Australians. We will see a JobKeeper cliff happening in March. We are seeing communities across Australia with record unemployment. We are seeing government ripping away support—rolling back support in March, in a matter of weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently travelled to North Queensland and met with a number of businesses. I heard from tourist operators in Cairns just last week, as part of Labor's pandemic recovery job and industry task force, with the Leader of the Opposition. Businesses are crying out for relief. They are worried if JobSeeker goes. All those employers are looking over a cliff in a matter of weeks. The city of Cairns has more people on JobKeeper than any other postcode in Queensland. So you are seeing all these people with government support being ripped apart, and the government is saying it's all Premier Palaszczuk's fault, it's all the border's fault or some nonsense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister for tourism visited Cairns last week on the same day as the Leader of the Opposition, and he promised absolutely nothing for the tourism industry. One operator said they normally have about 570 boats out on the ocean, and they have collapsed right down to only a handful. And we're seeing these credit reforms in the bill and the second reading amendment that we're dealing with tonight to put those people even further behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that consumer groups have said the changes will weaken the system and make it easier and easier for people to be ripped off. This constitutes a broken promise. A joint submission to the Senate inquiry led by the Consumer Action Law Centre said looser lending would reduce the incentive for banks to comply with lending standards because of the removal of penalties. It said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Repealing responsible lending obligations in the national credit legislation will remove individual legal rights to challenge lenders about their lending decisions and remove the penalty that can be awarded by the regulator ASIC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we're basically saying it's okay to be ripped off; it's okay for the banks to go back to where we were. The recommendations put forward by the royal commission are now going to be weakened. The ironical part of this is that the banks don't even want this; the banks didn't ask for this. All consumers rely on their lender to make assessments and let them know what amounts they can borrow and what is affordable. We now risk lenders going back to being about selling credit rather than ensuring loans are affordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay credit to Gerard Brody, the chief executive officer of the Consumer Action Law Centre, a fantastic advocate, and his team, who are speaking out every single day and trying to make the government listen—that loosening responsible lending practices will make things worse. The proposed legislation will wind back responsible lending obligations to credit contracts under $2,000 and consumer leases. The current legislation, as I've said, introduced in 2009, requires banks to check the financial situation and objective of each borrower applying for credit. The soaring loan numbers contradict the premise of the legislation that the economy was crippled by a lack of credit flow. The ABS lending data indicates that the growth of new loans is at a record high, and this includes occupier home loans. Commitment to a new dwelling of significant high-end value of total loan commitments, including personal finances, is also rising. So it does seem to be a broken promise by the government—their promise to implement the recommendations. The commissioner was clear that responsible lending provisions should be retained and more adequately enforced. So I say again to the government this evening—to the ministers and the members of the government—you gave a commitment to make sure that we would crack down on payday lenders and to make sure that there was responsible lending in this country. You gave a commitment to make sure that the recommendations of the royal commission would be implemented. For goodness sake, listen to what the experts are saying. Listen to what consumers are saying. Stand up for them just this once instead of standing up for the banks in this country.</span>

Schedule 1 of the bill enhances the framework governing the provisions of financial advice to clients under ongoing fair arrangements to prevent fees for no service. Schedule 2 of the bill introduces a new disclosure obligation to ensure that financial advisors who are not independent in relation to the provision of personal advice are required to provide their clients with a clear and concise written disclaimer that outlines that they are not independent and explains the reason why. Schedule 3 to the bill strengthens protections for individuals against paying fees for no service from their superannuation by prohibiting ongoing advice fees in MySuper and increasing the visibility of fees to individuals. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DZS" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  Labor created the Clean Energy Finance Corporation in 2012 with $10 billion worth of funding to support emerging renewables and energy-efficient investment and to reduce the cost of capital for important investments which have great benefits for our country. Since then it's become one of the world's leading green banks, described as such even by the current Prime Minister. It's deployed $6 billion worth of funds and leveraged around $27.3 billion in private investment. In doing so, it has helped finance around 18,000 projects and is responsible for around a million tonnes of abatement annually. This success comes despite the efforts of the current government. This government has sought to attack the CEFC on multiple occasions. It's sought to abolish it, undermined it and dilute its purpose, and there is much of that in the bill before the chamber today, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Amendment (Grid Reliability Fund) Bill 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some things in the bill that are sensible and which the Labor Party would support. For example, we support the CEFC having an expanded remit to help deliver a modern electricity grid. That's a sensible idea, and it's one that we've spoken about. In the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply, he announced the Rewiring the Nation initiative, under an Albanese Labor government. So it's a sensible idea. But what we won't do is allow the government to use the sensible idea in this bill as cover, as a Trojan Horse, for the undermining of the integrity of the CEFC to give unprecedented powers to the minister and to change the role of the CEFC away from its original intention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It appears that the government have given up on their dream of abolishing the CEFC, but they are still finding ways of undermining it. They are still finding ways of trying to take the CEFC away from its original purpose. They even attempted to stop the CEFC from investing in wind or rooftop solar. I can't think of anything better for the CEFC to invest in than wind and rooftop solar, and yet the government are trying to expand the remit of the CEFC—they tried to reduce it before and now they're trying to expand it—into areas it should not be investing in. I'll deal with that a little later. They've also altered the investment mandate, significantly limiting the degree to which CEFC could support new technology deployment. Since then, they've used the CEFC's $10 billion to create announcement after announcement of reallocated funding as a fig leaf for their inaction on climate change. The government have said that they believe in the CEFC, but this bill is really a mechanism to undermine it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former leaders of the CEFC and ARENA have written a letter expressing their concerns and their opposition to the bill as it stands. They've said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We do not support changes to the CEFC's legislation that undermine its independence, low emissions remit, commitment to profitability, or its avoidance of fossil fuels as part of a clear commitment to assist in the reduction of Australia's climate emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the experts say the CEFC should be independent, have a low-emissions remit, support economically viable projects and avoid fossil fuels. That makes sense to me, so I will move amendments to make sure that those principles remain. It's up to the government to decide whether they will accept those amendments or not—whether they will continue to undermine those commonsense principles by insisting on their approach. That will determine whether we vote for the bill in its final form. If our amendments are accepted, we will happily pass the bill. If they're not accepted, we will oppose the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to make the most significant changes to the CEFC since its establishment. With that shaky record of the government when it comes to investment in renewable energy, these changes should be seen in this context. Again I say that Labor particularly welcomes changes that would make it easier for the CEFC to invest in transmission, storage and reliability assets. These are sensible changes. They're a small step towards Labor's own policy to invest $20 billion to rebuild and modernise our outdated electricity transmission system, which is so important for reasons of grid reliability as we transition to renewable sources. But we won't support the bill as it's drafted, because of three fundamental concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first goes to independence. This bill would undermine the independence of the CEFC and hand unprecedented powers to the minister. In our view, a fundamental reason for the success of the CEFC thus far has been its independence. That's how the previous Labor government designed it: to be at arm's length from the government of the day to make investment decisions based on their merits. The CEFC does not need political interference. The bill includes a provision which allows the minister to directly determine whether an investment is eligible for CEFC support or not. It will give the minister unprecedented powers in shaping CEFC investments. There's no explanation from the government as to why this is necessary. They haven't outlined the problem that they're trying to solve. They haven't pointed to a mischief or a shortcoming in the CEFC's current operation. They simply say they want more power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a fundamental concern of the opposition that this ministerial discretion and power will be provided to the minister of the day. I would have this concern about any minister. I would have this concern regardless of who the minister for climate change and energy was. I would oppose it on principle. But I must say I'm particularly concerned that it's this minister, with his track record of problems in his portfolio and of not accepting the fundamentals of climate change science. This embattled minister has in so many instances found himself having to answer questions about his performance. Whether it's the Sydney City Council, whether it's matters in his electorate or whether it's conflicts of interest, this minister has been very embattled. I certainly would not support this minister having those powers. But, as a matter of principle, I don't believe any minister should have those powers, including if there were a change of government. I myself would not want those powers. I would want the CEFC to do its job. It has a highly credentialed board and management structure. Very respected individuals have served on the board of the CEFC over the years—some of Australia's most senior businesspeople. They don't need ministerial interference. They don't need ministerial direction in relation to how the CEFC does its job. So our amendments will seek to reverse that change, which has been unexplained. I would suggest that it's unexplained because it's inexplicable, apart from being a power grab.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue relates to changes in the definition of 'low-emissions technology' to include gas. At the moment, there is no explicit prohibition on the power of the CEFC to fund projects related to gas; they simply don't meet the emissions standards that are required. Gas can't be regarded as a low-emissions technology. I understand the importance of gas to the Australian economy. I understand its importance and the role it will play for years to come in firming up the grid as we transition to more renewables. I understand its importance in providing feedstock to manufacturers for plastics across a whole range of manufactures. Gas will play a role in our energy supply for the foreseeable future as we transition to other mechanisms which can firm up the grid, like hydrogen. But that is not going to happen today or tomorrow, so we're going to need gas in the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question is not about the role of gas; the question is whether the CEFC should be providing a public subsidy for gas projects. The experts say the case for public funding of new gas power generation is weak. It's a well-established technology. The CEFC is designed to support emerging technologies and work that is at its earlier stages—and at various points along the continuum—which requires investment but can make a contribution. Gas, despite its importance to the system going forward, does not meet those criteria. If gas were a low-emission technology, the government wouldn't need an amendment; gas would pass the test that already exists for CEFC investments. There would be no need for legislative intervention by the government. The CEFC Board could simply approve and fund gas projects because gas is a low-emissions technology. The fact of the matter is that it is not. Gas does not meet the test of being a low-emissions technology simply because it isn't. It has a role to play and it's important, but it is not a low-emissions technology, and the government is engaging in sophistry by suggesting that it is. Changing the definition to allow investment in gas flies directly in the face of the CEFC's mission, which is to support renewables generation. We on this side of the House believe that the CEFC should remain a renewables and decarbonisation funding agency—not one that can be directed by the minister of the day to fund fossil fuels, as important as gas is. It should not be the remit of the CEFC to fund those projects, and our detailed amendments will reflect that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third concern of the opposition goes to the bill's removal of the requirement that the CEFC investments make a positive return. I would have thought the government, which wraps itself in alleged fiscal responsibility, would want the CEFC to be making investments projected to give a positive return. It's been crucial to the success of the CEFC. Since its inception, the CEFC has returned $718 million to the Commonwealth. I suspect that's why the Prime Minister himself has referred to the CEFC as 'the world's most successful green bank', due not only to the investment projects it has created, the jobs it has created and the investments it has leveraged from the private sector but also due to the returns to the government. That is a good thing, and it beggars belief that the government would want to overturn that. Do they want the CEFC to make investments that don't provide a positive return? Are they encouraging that sort of investment by the CEFC? It's the only explanation one could reach. Again, our amendments will deal with that. We'll be moving amendments to this bill to protect the independence and financial integrity of the CEFC and to ensure that it remains focused on low-emissions technology.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  I am honoured to represent the good people of Groom. It's a place of strong community values that is proud both of its ambitions for the future and of its history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My own family's history is but a small part of the great Australian journey, and I stand before you as both a proud citizen of modern Australia and a proud descendant of the pioneers whose labours laid the foundations of this nation. My father's ancestors arrived as Scottish farmers, who followed the promise of opportunity that called them out of Glasgow and out of Fife. They docked at Adelaide and made their way by horse and cart into northern New South Wales, eventually reaching the golden triangle between Inverell, Moree and North Star. Life wasn't always easy but it was good, and Australia has given us much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian journey was entirely different for my mother's family. William Shaw arrived as a convict on the Third Fleet in 1791; Catherine Neal was transported some five years later, and I'm the product of their union, nine generations on. Another convict ancestor, Humphrey Gainey, was sent here much later, in 1830, following a rather unsuccessful stint as a highwayman in Cork.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gaineys and the Shaws struggled to find their place in Australia, but, over time, duty called and they were ready to serve. My great-grandfather, John Hercules Robertson, was gassed in the First World War and, upon his return home, his lungs continued to painfully deteriorate. He lived just long enough to see both of his sons return safely home from the Second World War, and I think of what dark nights he must have spent, waiting for news of his boys.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My grandfather's story is very much that of the men of his generation. Due to his injuries, Stuart Robertson returned from the war too late to receive the soldier settlement scheme and together with his wife, Hazel, who had served in the Australian Women's Army Service, had to start from nothing, having been prepared to give everything. But they never complained. With his own hands he built a jig to cast concrete blocks on Sundays, while the rest of the week he worked three jobs to save enough money to buy a plot of land. When he finished building his house, he turned his boundless energy to building the community of Warialda that he so loved, and I thank the member for Parkes for his own dedication to that beautiful town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For 25 years my grandfather was chief of the local fire brigade, volunteered with the Lions Club and was Santa Claus to a couple of generations of kids. When Hazel descended into dementia, he spent every breakfast, lunch and tea for 11 years by her side at the nursing home. He served his country, his community and his family with loyalty, good humour and kindness. He had a hard life but a good one, and he gave Australia much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is shared amongst my family's stories, be it in finding here plenty or penury, is what makes Australia great; with hard work we can build something good within ourselves, and with service we can build something even better together. This nation has always understood the value of equality of opportunity and reward for effort—the foundation principles of our coalition government—which is why a Centre-Right coalition has been called into government by the Australian people for 68 of the last 98 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia today is greater than it has ever been, with greater reward for effort and greater opportunities for all Australians. This country is full of family histories of service, of dedication, of hands heavy with the callouses earned under the slow labours of crafting this country. We come from varied beginnings but together we have built a nation that Australians are proud of. It is our responsibility to place into the next generation's hands the tools and the callouses they'll need to build our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My greatest hope is that our nation will always be a place for people from every corner of the world to contribute and gain reward for their effort. My father-in-law's family fled Europe after the Second World War and came to Australia with not a pound in their pockets, not a word of English on their tongues. Many Australians will understand, having experienced that very situation. Alphonsus Vanderhorst was raised with a deep love for his new home and a desire to serve the nation that had taken him in. My wife and I were extremely proud when he recently retired after 49 years of service and support to the Australian Army, many of those spent at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The seat of Groom nestles around the city of Toowoomba, Queensland's very own shining city on a hill. It was there that my wife was born and raised, and when it came time for us to settle down and raise our own family there was no easier decision to make. Encompassing towns and villages such as Pittsworth, Oakey, Highfields, Bowenville, Greenmount and Goombungee, Groom is characterised by its thriving agricultural industry and its beautiful, tree-lined suburbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, drive through our region and you will find we are much more than just farmland and feedlots. I've mentioned the Oakey barracks, with another barracks at Cabarlah, and we have a mine at Acland that at its peak supported 500 local jobs and I hope to see those good days return. Underpinning these heavy industries are Groom's manufacturing and transport industries that place our region as a strategic hub as we build Inland Rail. In Toowoomba Region health is the largest employer and our wonderful health professionals play such an important role in our city, with health care being one of the key reasons that so many people choose to move to Toowoomba. In education, again, our region plays the role of a hub, with an extraordinary array of excellent public and private schools servicing families from all across southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Heritage Bank, Australia's largest customer owned bank, has its headquarters located in Toowoomba and our region greatly benefits from the support of our local financial industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With such strong foundations in place you can see why the Toowoomba Region is a great place to come to, and it's with pride that we reflect upon the many success stories of those Australians who've chosen to make their home among us in more recent years. It's a joy to walk through Queens Park on a weekend afternoon and see the children from so many different cultural backgrounds playing together. The integration of the Yazidi and Somali communities in Toowoomba sets the benchmark for modern immigration, and if regional Australia is to thrive we need to learn from this experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently received a note from a local resident, Mrs Bonita Cattell, that best describes how we work together in Groom. She writes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We met some (Yazidi) families in a park twelve months ago and have had them in our home a number of times. We went to an end of fast celebration in December where we met a young Yazidi (man) from Armidale. He said his parents were lonely in Toowoomba as they had not met many Australians. So we visited them two days later … and are having them in our home. We are in our seventies and our lives have been enriched by them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mrs Cattell goes on to ask that I pass on her thanks to former Prime Minister Tony Abbott for the role he played in bringing these people to Australia. Well, for the first and the last time, I will dare to speak on behalf of Mr Abbott and say, 'No, Bonita, it is you who deserves the thanks.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we work together so well in Groom is that we have a strong sense of our culture—we know who we are and what we are about. Our service clubs, religious organisations and community groups are committed to helping others. I know that my predecessor, Dr John McVeigh, felt very passionately on this point and I thank him for his service to our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Toowoomba was and continues to be built by people who are driven to lead their communities, from the early pioneers to modern pioneers, like Clive Berghofer, John Russell, Gary Gardner, the Wagner family, and the many others who understand that we were not born to be shaped by government but, rather, that the future will be shaped by the hands of the people themselves. Groom has never lacked leadership and it is my privilege to serve beside the region's leaders of today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The political history of Groom tells us much about the contribution that conservatism has made to modern Australia. Our first federal member, William Groom, after whom the seat is now named, spoke on the role of the individual in shaping the nation and warned against the spread of socialism. In doing so, he gave word to the beliefs of those who valued a fair go. He understood that national growth could only be supported by government and not led by it and that it would be individual enterprise that our nation must be built on. He also believed in the value of community and that it was the duty of every person to lend a helping hand. A society's capacity to act upon its compassionate instincts is underlined by economic strength and individual freedoms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Littleton Groom carried on his father's place in parliament and pushed strongly for rail infrastructure to open up supply and distribution networks for Toowoomba's agricultural sector. Nearly a hundred years later, in the age of Inland Rail—a project that will arguably benefit the Toowoomba region more than most along its entire route—it's important to remember that this concept is not new, nor is it unproven. Littleton Groom believed in the power of nation-building infrastructure, and it's a belief that has passed on through every federal member for Groom since. I'll work hard to ensure that Inland Rail delivers every possible benefit to the people of the Toowoomba region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While delivering Inland Rail will keep our hands busy in the short term, we must look to the future, and fast passenger rail connecting Toowoomba to the rest of South-East Queensland is inevitable, with the question being not if but when, as the city continues to grow and prosper. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every member for Groom has stood up for a prosperous, fair and united Australia, and I will be no different. I'll work for a future that pays less attention to the unimportant differences between us and instead rewards good character and hard work. I'll work for an Australia that centres itself around the family. I'll work for an Australia that has opportunity for all and is strong enough to give a hand up to those who have fallen on hard times. I'll work for an Australia that continues the traditions and institutions that have made Western civilisation the greatest source of good known to man. These are the beliefs that make me a proud member of the Liberal National Party, and I hold them dearly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What unites us is an understanding that freedom and responsibility can only ever exist in the hands of an individual, an understanding that no amount of government intervention can stay the sweep of Adam Smith's invisible hand. I believe in equality of opportunity as best not only for the individual but also for the nation, as it allows for discrimination only on the basis of competence, ensuring our best people are given the greatest chance to do the most good. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We pray that 2021 will be a very different year from 2020. I was not surprised to find that we ended 2020 with consumer confidence at a 10-year high, because this confidence has been noticeable in the conversations I've had with the people of Groom. Our people have confidence in Australia's ability to handle the pandemic, they have confidence in their community's ability to work together for a greater good and they have confidence in the Morrison government's plan to rebuild our economy. The people of Groom are optimistic about their future, and this is a very good thing for Australia, because we're a great contributor to the nation, with a high gross regional product. I represent an area where, if government makes an investment, it will get a return on that investment. I represent an area that is growing and wants to continue to grow. Gus Romero and Mark Cassidy, both owners of Harvey Norman franchises in my electorate, tell me they're excited about the current growth they see in Groom's property market. They know that, after you build a new home or after you renovate your home, the next thing you do is furnish it. In Highfields, the Avenues development sold 30 blocks in 14 days after the announcement of the HomeBuilder grant. This wasn't an injection of cash; it was an injection of confidence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I bring to the parliament a keen interest in foreign policy that has grown during my time overseas, in countries aligned to our values and not. I view Australia, more and more, as having a significant role to play in the world. We are a Western nation in all but geography, and our future success lies not in becoming more politically akin to our neighbours but in continuing to provide them with a unique proposition. We are a safe haven for their investment, a willing partner for their trade. The trajectory of this entire region bends towards Western ideals, and we have an important leadership role to play. We must always value our point of difference and fight to retain it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a trading partner we have so much to offer our neighbours—we have an abundance of natural resources, great educational facilities and excellent agricultural products that we can deliver with high quality and high reliability. We seek trade partnerships in good faith and understand that a rising tide lifts all boats. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud of the contribution Groom has made to our nation's military efforts, and we have a long history. Toowoomba Grammar School's Army Cadet Unit predates the formation of the Australian Army itself and counts among its alumni the great ANZAC general Sir Harry Chauvel, who served with such distinction in Gallipoli and the Middle East.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also very proud of the contribution that the defence industry makes to our local economy and our local community. Toowoomba is a great place to expand our defence facilities, as we have room to grow, infrastructure in place and longstanding bonds of friendship with the defence community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to bring to the House's attention the goodwill that our defence community generates not just at home but internationally. During last year's bushfires, the Republic of Singapore Air Force contributed two Chinook helicopters, which are based at Oakey, to support relief efforts carried out by the Royal Australian Air Force. Our defence community not only are there to protect us in times of trouble but also serve as terrific ambassadors for us on the international stage. Long may Australia's defence community call Groom home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a mining engineer, I've seen both good and bad mining around the world, and Australia should be very proud of the high standard of mining practices that take place within our borders. The men and women who go to work in Australia's pits and portals are amongst our best workers, and, as a project manager, it was always such a privilege and an honour to lead my crews into their daily work. Australian miners operate under the world's best quality, safety and environmental standards while still presenting a highly profitable investment option. In part this is due to our readiness to champion new technologies and push the development of future technologies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to entering politics, I led research in the mining industry with a cooperative research centre. The new technologies that have been advanced by that organisation have been enthusiastically supported by the industry with companies such as Hatch and Orica committing to commercialise research undertaken there. Big miners such as BHP Billiton, Newcrest and Anglo American have partnered with CRC ORE because they know that these Australian technologies have the power to reduce both water and energy consumption thus reducing the cost and the carbon footprint of their operations. This is an example of government accelerating the process of technology uptake by bringing together researchers with end users in an environment that demands performance and cost efficiency. We cannot underestimate the role that technology will play in addressing the future challenges faced by government, industry and households alike. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the University of Southern Queensland, Groom's future as not just a regional but a national technology centre is being realised. USQ is building sovereign defence and space capability in advanced manufacturing, hypersonics, rocketry and astrophysics. In this context, 'building sovereign capability' is another way of saying 'return on investment', and this is a great example of an Australian university proudly contributing to Australia's national interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Darling Downs Health Service has plans for a new state-of-the-art hospital in Toowoomba that will not only cater for the region's growing needs but will provide access to the latest medical technologies and incorporate expanded teaching and research facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obadare Group received an accelerating commercialisation grant from this government and have turned themselves into Australia's only API-licensed drill rig producer, now establishing the Toowoomba region as a service centre for the oil and gas industry—again, more investment, more return.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local builder, Geoff Gibson, is using Earth Friendly Concrete, a product researched, developed and commercialised in Toowoomba by Wagners, that reduces the embodied carbon of concrete by up to 80 per cent. This product is now being used in London on the biggest infrastructure project in Europe, HS2, and is another example of technology driving Toowoomba's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Groom, we're unafraid to push into the future of energy production with a truly agnostic approach having a thermal coalmine, two solar farms and a gas-fired power station. We happily embrace opportunity and are ready to face the challenges that lie ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm humbled to be standing here today and I'm aware of the incredible opportunity that I have been afforded, to focus my energies solely on the doing of good for my nation; there are many people to thank for that. To the Liberal National Party, its members across the state and particularly the Groom FDC and the excellent SECs of Toowoomba North, Toowoomba South and Condamine, I owe a debt of service. To Cynthia Hardy, John Martlew, Ben Ready and all the volunteers who stood out on prepoll and election day, I say thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the member for Lingiari spoke movingly on the impact that his political career had on his family, and, although we sit on opposite sides of the chamber and at opposite ends of our careers, his words formed in me a chord that I would like here to strike. I want to thank my parents, Allen and Barbara, for inspiring me to ask for more out of life. As a boy and a young man, I had the pleasure of working side by side with my father, labouring under the hot Queensland sun; no-one has ever asked more of me nor shown me more the extent to which the mind can overcome the limitations of the body. My mother has been the living embodiment of the idea that 'life is good', and what stores I have of resilience and humility I get from her. Mum, I remember, as a boy, watching you working as a Hansard reporter down here in this very chamber. I hope you like the view from the gallery as much as I did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my beautiful wife, Louise, your love, the persistence of your honesty and your belief in what we can achieve together continues to surprise and overwhelm me. This, as with every other step we've taken around the world, is a shared journey; we are here together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my beautiful children, Adeline, Everard and Claude, I love you and I'm proud of you. I give you the same challenge that my father laid upon me: that is, it is your responsibility to take a step further in life than I have. I trust you with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some people that I have long called friends, that I now get to call colleagues, and I wish to thank them for all their help and support. Senator Rennick, you have been a good friend and a great mate. Senator Stoker, I thank you for always supporting me. I thank you and Adam for helping Louise and I make the decision to stand for Groom, and I thank you for being a role model to my daughter. Sadly, I do not have the chance to be a colleague to former Senator Barry O'Sullivan, but I treasure his friendship and guidance all the same. Barry keeps his best deeds private and makes his rougher edges public in complete opposition and perhaps stubborn defiance to the trends of the day. I thank him and Kristina for their support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Sam Catalano for setting us both the challenge on the day of our graduation of building 'exceptional careers'. Sam, we've always held each other to account, together meeting both success and failure as the imposters they are. To my other great mate in the UK, Oliver Richbell, Tangles, you may not know it but it was in our many conversations at the Jamaica Wine House and on the late train to Bedford that my political convictions were forming. You have played a bigger part than you know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the teachers I had at Ipswich Grammar School—Mike Murray and Maggie Chay in particular. Mike joins us in the gallery. I recall the memory of two fine educators who did the most to shape my young life, Mr Ray Swan and Mr Dick Rima. Finally I thank Wendy Armstrong, Trevor Watts, Fred Geldart and Bill O'Chee for their kind care and counsel.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The LNP works best when it recognises itself as a grassroots volunteer organisation. There have been hundreds of people who have stood up for me, but I want to mention the small handful of very young party members who got behind me from the moment I put my hand up for preselection. They carried no weight in the party and they promised no influence; they only demanded that I always remain true to myself. Doug Allen, Justin McGovern, Ben Apsey and Jeremy Bazley, you are the future of the LNP. Our party and our nation depend upon constant renewal of ideas and reaffirmation of beliefs. Doug, I look forward to your future contributions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, under the strong leadership of Scott Morrison, we are bringing together Australia's stories—those of our modern nation and those of what was—and we are creating something even better as we continue the great Australian journey.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is moving for this message to be made an order of the day for the next sitting, not to be dealt with today, as the government does not support this bill, the Royal Commissions Amendment (Confidentiality Protections) Bill 2020, which has passed in the other place. The government agrees this is a significant issue and it is important to ensure that people with disability can engage and fully take part in this nationally significant inquiry. The government has listened to people with disability, their families and carers, and the broader public about the importance of ensuring that people have the confidence to come forward and tell their story. While there are extensive protections after a royal commission has ended, we understand that there may be some concerns about the willingness of some to come forward. Of course we want people to come forward, but we cannot support the Greens bill today, as it does not fully capture what is needed for this particular royal commission. On 20 October 2020, the government announced it would introduce measures to protect the confidentiality of information given to this royal commission. We've been carefully considering the full implications of these protections on criminal prosecutions and civil proceedings, and the government's bill will be sensitive to the various ways in which people have given information to the royal commission. The government intends to bring forward its bill in the coming weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are issues with the bill, which I will briefly outline. There are several problems with the Greens bill. First, the bill appears to try to replicate section 60N of the Royal Commissions Act, which protects information if the commission has indicated that the information would be treated as confidential after the inquiry ends. However, this may be problematic as the disability royal commission has said publicly that some information may not be confidential. It's important that the legislation protects information which was not provided on an understanding of confidentiality by the commission. Second, the Greens bill does not attempt to identify the types of sensitive information caught by this provision. Item 600 of the Greens bill appears to try and replicate section 60N of the act but has removed the description of the types of information the section is intended to apply to. By contrast the government's bill will provide comprehensive protections to appropriate categories of information, for example in relation to the child abuse royal commission protections where applied to the accounts of an actual person's experiences of child sexual abuse and also accounts of what happened to other people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Greens bill, the government's bill also includes other amendments to the Royal Commissions Act 1902 sought by the commission's chair—amendments to streamline information-sharing between Commonwealth royal commissions and concurrent state royal commissions, and amendments to address practical issues raised by the chair, including the issue of non-publication orders. This is important as they often need to be made in urgent circumstances to protect a person's identity and they currently need to be made by a number of commissioners together, despite them being geographically located in different states and territories. With that, I reiterate to the House that the government is moving for this message to be made an order of the day for the next sitting, not be dealt with today, as we do not support this bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a loophole that has been open since November 2019 that is hampering the work of the disability royal commission and that is stopping people having the confidence to come and tell their stories. The government has known about this loophole since it was first raised by the commissioner. Then, in this parliament, Senator Steele-John took the matter to the government in February last year and said, 'There is a problem with the legislation.' The problem with the legislation that the royal commission itself has identified is this: there is a real question mark, in many instances, over whether evidence that someone gives or comments that someone makes or information that someone provides to the commission remains confidential when the commission concludes its work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to think about this for a couple of minutes to understand why this would make some people—people who have already been through a lot; more than any of us should have to go through—think twice before coming to give their stories. You can understand why it led the commissioner and the royal commission, in its recent report, to say, 'This question around confidentiality is getting in the way of us doing our work.' So we brought it to the government's attention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission raised it in 2019. We brought it to the government's attention back in February 2020 and said, 'You need to introduce a bill to fix this.' That was a year ago. A year ago we put this to the government, and the government said, 'Yes, we accept it's a problem.' Great, you accept it's a problem. It's a problem that is hurting people with a disability who want the confidence to tell their story. It's a problem that the commissioner says is affecting the commission's ability to do its work. The government has known this for over a year and has admitted it is a problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We kept waiting and waiting and waiting for the government to bring in a bill to fix it, and it won't do it. The government refuses to do it. It's either laziness, malice or a distinct lack of care. Whatever the excuse is, it is inexcusable. The government can rush into this place legislation that takes away people's rights at work and say, 'It's urgent; we've got to deal with it.' But, when they've had over a year to close a loophole in one of the most important royal commissions we have had for some time, they can't get around to doing it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have taken action. We have taken action to close the loophole. We have taken action and brought into the Senate a bill that will close the loophole. With the support of the Labour Party and the crossbench working together, that bill got through the Senate. That doesn't happen every day. It does not happen every day that we sit here in this chamber and deal with a bill that has majority support in the Senate. Think about the varying interests represented in the Senate. Think about what it takes to get them all lined up against the government. The government has to have seriously stuffed up for the whole Senate to join together and say, 'You have refused to close this loophole for a year with no good reason, so we are doing it for you.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government comes in here today and says, 'No, we can't consider it immediately because—just take it from us—we've got a bill in the works.' Well, that's what you said back in October, government. When we introduced this bill and brought it to the Senate in October you said: 'No, we can't support it now, because we've got our own bill. It's coming. Just you wait.' We are here in February 2020, a year after we raised it with the government, and there is still no bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I guess it shouldn't surprise us, because that's exactly what the government have done when it comes to establishing an independent anticorruption commission. They said, 'Oh, no, we cannot possibly deal with a bill that has passed the Senate and got support from the Senate, because we've got our own.' It shouldn't have surprised us. But we did hold out hope that, even if they wouldn't listen to the Greens, they would at least listen to the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">econd progress r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport</span> of the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability makes it clear that the limitations of the confidentiality provisions are impinging on people's willingness to speak with the commission and affecting the scope of the commission's work. An entire section of this progress report is devoted to confidentiality protections, or the lack thereof, and the challenges this situation presents to the important work of the commission. You can only be left with the conclusion that, if they won't bring a bill in when they are being asked to fix a problem and close a loophole, the government are perhaps deliberately trying to undermine the work of the commission. They have had over a year to bring in a bill that deals with a technical matter about confidentiality. All of the words from the government about supporting the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability evaporate when you understand that they are not giving the commission the tools to do its job, and one is invited to form the conclusion that they are doing it deliberately. Why else would you sit on your hands for more than a year? Maybe it's laziness, or maybe it's priorities—maybe it's more important to cut people's rights at work than it is to give people with a disability the right to go and tell their story. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had ample opportunity during the course of a year, in what is the longest and most expensive royal commission in Australia's history, to tidy up this loophole and to help the commission do its work, and the government has refused to act. When this bill was being debated in the Senate today, members of the government were almost embarrassed to get up and make their contributions. They were falling over themselves to say, 'We not only support the commission; we understand this is a problem and we really hope it's going to be fixed.' They are right to be embarrassed. The people with responsibility have dragged their heels for over a year, and they cannot come up with a single good excuse as to why it has taken this long, other than that it is supposedly complicated. Well, that's why you've got a department. That's why you've got the resources of government at your disposal—to deal with things that actually aren't that complicated. We all know what the problem is. The royal commission has spelt it out in detail. Bring in a bill to fix it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard those embarrassed members of the government backbench saying today, 'Look, just take it on trust that this problem will be fixed by the time the commission concludes.' Has anyone else ever been asked to give information or evidence to a royal commission, under circumstances where they think it's confidential, to just be told, 'Oh, no, it might not be confidential now, but trust us and we'll fix it up by the end'? No-one has ever been asked to appear before a royal commission or to provide information to a royal commission on the basis of an IOU from the government that they'll fix it up before the commission ends. No! And no-one should be asked to do it for this critical royal commission either. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the government: we've heard this before. We've heard your excuses before, over and over again—'Don't worry, a bill is in the works.' Well, it is now at the point where the royal commission itself is pleading in its interim report to fix this problem. You know, government, that this is hampering the commission's ability to do its work. You know that it's inhibiting people from feeling the confidence they need to come and tell their stories, at a time when they need everyone supporting them, including the government and the force of law. I hope the government reconsiders. It tells you something when the whole political array of the Senate lines up together to say, 'Fix this loophole.' Bills like this don't come very often, and, when they do, it's a sign the government has failed to do its job. The government should support this amendment, debate the bill and pass it. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00ATG" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  I rise to second this most important amendment by the member for Melbourne. The Royal Commissions Amendment (Confidentiality Protections) Bill 2020 would amend the Royal Commissions Act 1902 and make consequential amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to ensure ongoing confidentiality protections for people seeking to give evidence to the disability royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to explain to Australians who are listening to this parliamentary debate and to those in the media who are curious why the government is opposing this, the status quo is that there's a disability royal commission underway, one which I called for with Labor in 2007 and one which the Greens have been on the record as supporting for a very long time. The federal government did move to set up a disability royal commission in 2019 I think or at the end of 2018. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This royal commission is underway, and it's heard horrific stories. Currently, the process is that evidence which is received in private sessions conducted by the disability royal commission is guaranteed to remain confidential after the commission's work is done; however—and this is where the need for these amendments, supported by the Senate, remarkably, comes into play—the same privacy protections do not apply where evidence or information was received by the commission outside of private session. Not all evidence is given in private session; some evidence is given outside of private session. Prior to the evidence or information being given, the commission indicated to the person providing the evidence or information that it would be treated as confidential, so, even if the commission said they'd treat it as private, that can't be enforced. In fact, even after it was received by the commission, the material was treated as confidential, but the privacy protections do not apply. So this is an important bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're fixing up something which should be fixed up. Most significantly, even though the government demonstrated some recalcitrance, to which I'll return, the majority of the Senate, one of the two houses of the Australian parliament, passed this bill. Bizarrely, although the coalition oppose this bill and they were in the minority in the Senate voting against it, they've actually agreed with what the bill proposes. For Australians driving home or listening to this debate, I'll repeat that. There is a flaw in the disability royal commission. The flaw has been pointed out. The Senate has, by a majority, voted to rectify the flaws, and we seek to now do that in the lower house, but the coalition said, 'Yes, you're right: there are flaws. But no, we will not vote for it.' This is why people hate Australian politics! This is game playing at its most extreme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is up to the coalition and the backbench of the coalition to explain why they are holding a position which is so bendable, so rubbery that on the one hand they think it should be fixed but on the other hand they don't think they should fix it now. The position of the coalition would not be out of place in the famous illustrated Indian Sanskrit text—this Australian government is so contorted. In fact, the Attorney-General put out a media release in October of last year and he entitled it 'Legislative reforms to provide greater privacy protections for participants in disability royal commission'. In it, the government pledged to make amendments to the Royal Commissions Act, which this bill before the House does today, to provide the confidentiality of information given to this nationally significant inquiry. So the Attorney-General has said that they want to have a bill which does what we're doing today, but they can't actually vote for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason why this has come about is the chair of the royal commission, the Honourable Ronald Sackville, AO, QC, requested these amendments which we're putting up. So not only has the government agreed there's a flaw, not only have the opposition and the crossbenchers recognised there is a flaw, but it's on the basis of the chair of the royal commission, who the government appointed to do the work. He's said people with disability should get the reassurance their information will be protected during the life of the royal commission and after it's concluded its work. So the Attorney-General, when he was taking his sensible pill, said he's instructed his department 'to work swiftly on the amendments.' Well, they certainly haven't won any medals for swiftness. In fact, the government's been so plodding and ponderous on this that others have had to step into the breach, hence this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disability advocates have argued persuasively that to maintain the integrity of the royal commission people should have their privacy protected. The amendments in this bill have been sought by disability advocates and sought by the chair of the disability royal commission. In fact, it is impossible to find anyone who doesn't agree with the amendments. But this is the stupidity of Australian politics at this point in time. The coalition know our amendments are right, they just cannot vote for them. I say again: they know this is correct, they just won't vote for it. They privately say it's correct. Everyone says this is correct. But we are stuck in this very unusual situation. So, despite the Morrison government's aversion to following through on its agenda and actually doing what it says it'll do, are the House of Reps coalition members really going to vote against legislation their own Attorney-General said should be swiftly enacted, the royal commission said should be enacted, disability advocates said should be enacted and the Senate said should be enacted?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason why they oppose it, though—and this really needs to be explored—is that this is essentially their own plan. The unkind would call this an act of bastardry. Perhaps it is, perhaps it isn't. I'll leave it to the people of Australia to judge this. But, whatever you call this act, it is certainly strange and surreal. They're saying to Australians with disability, 'We'll get around to giving you a royal commission where your privacy is protected but on our terms and only on our time line.' They're simply saying, 'Too bad, so sad; we can't do this.' This is actually ridiculous. Members of the government might say, 'If the opposition and the Greens want to do it, we must vote against it.' That's what people hate about Australian politics. Disability organisations raised this privacy problem 300 days ago, in May 2020. Yet we're still here and we're still waiting—waiting for people with disability just to be able to have the protections of privacy in the royal commission which this government's called.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have consistently shown a disinterest in acting on things, and this is what I want to talk about in the remaining few minutes of this presentation on this amendment. People with disability, and carers, have worked this government out: they're just not interested—for whatever reason. This is a case where the government have said, 'Yes, we know it should change, but, because someone else is saying it, we won't do it.' This is arrogance. This is hubris. This is conceited behaviour. This is pompous behaviour. This is haughty. This is a government with an exaggerated sense of their own infallibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we've seen this throughout the handling of the disability portfolio and government services. We've had the poor old head of the National Disability Insurance Agency declare, in year eight of this government, that they're going to go back to basics for the NDIS. What have you been doing for the last eight years? Now we're paying senior public servants and ministers to go back to basics, but what have you been doing for the last eight years? We've got the robodebt issue, which was pointed out by advocates as being a problem for years. I had the temerity to write an article in a newspaper saying it was probably an illegal scheme more than a year ago—but this government has to wait till the Dawe report and its own ministers and senior public servants will be dragged to give evidence to finally settle. This is an out-of-touch government. We've already celebrated the third birthday of Labor's call to set up a national anti-corruption commission and this government won't do it. They spent a year and a half fighting the advocates once it was absolutely established beyond doubt that robodebt was illegal—and they wasted hundreds of millions of dollars more in fighting the claim. We've got the disability support pensioners, who were neglected during the COVID crisis. The government's ultimate salt on the wound of its treatment of disability and carers is to give us Stuart Robert as the minister for that area, showing what the government really thinks of the portfolio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But all issues aside—that laundry list of government neglect and disinterest—this bill should be supported because there is a flaw in the ability of people to have privacy when they give evidence in a royal commission. The flaw has been spotted and identified. The Attorney-General said he wanted swift action. Disability advocates have said this is a terrible flaw. The chairman of the royal commission, the Hon. Ronald Sackville, has said something needs to be done about this. And yet, like the good old troops that they are, the coalition lions on the backbench led by the donkeys on the frontbench are going to march into the guns of voting on something which is errantly stupid. There is no argument. What the government spinners say behind lines is: 'Oh well, the royal commissioner can do this anyway. This is all a fuss about nothing.' Well, if it was a fuss about nothing, why would the chairman of the royal commission be raising it? If it was a fuss about nothing, why did the Attorney-General say to act swiftly? I would just say to coalition members that blind obedience to stupid orders isn't always the wisest course of action for your constituents. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  The world economy is transitioning to a zero net carbon future in a bid to protect future generations from the effects of climate change. Countries with the strongest ambitions in this transition are relying on more renewables and other emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, to get there. As many of us know, Australia has a long and complicated energy history, but it is now emerging at the forefront of renewable technology investment under the leadership of the Morrison government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside its commitment to renewable energy, the Morrison government is committed to encouraging investment to support the reliability of the electricity grid and improve affordability for energy users. On 30 October 2019, the Morrison government announced the introduction of a new $1 billion Grid Reliability Fund. This fund, to be administered by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, will support investments in new energy generation, storage and transmission, and investments in infrastructure, including eligible projects short-listed under the Underwriting New Generation Investments program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Grid Reliability Fund will unlock private sector investment for clean energy projects. The fund will draw on the energy and financial markets' expertise of the CEFC to make further investments in reliable, clean energy technologies. The benefits of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Amendment (Grid Reliability Fund) Bill 2020 are, ultimately, threefold. Firstly, it will secure the reliability of the grid. A reliable electricity supply that keeps the lights on is essential for Australian households and businesses. With an anticipated doubling of demand in our electricity sector, our energy mix will require an increase in energy generation that can deliver when customers need it. Providing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation with an additional $1 billion will benefit energy market participants by providing a trusted counterparty for grid reliability investments, allowing the government to crowd in private sector involvement and to leverage its finance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this bill will put downward pressure on prices. It is not enough just to keep the lights on; these lights must also be affordable. This can be achieved by shaking up the energy market and making way for new players. As Liberals, we know that competition is good for consumers. Projects supported by the CEFC and the new generation investment program will also address the concentration of energy generation asset ownership by improving access for new and smaller participants in the market. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found that these small players often struggle to secure necessary finance due to large customers being unwilling to enter long-term offtake agreements. Additional support for these businesses will put downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices by increasing competition amongst generators. This is great news for Australian businesses and for Australian households. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, this bill supports Australia's growing appetite for renewable energy. In 2019, Australia's investment per person in renewable energy was greater than countries such as the United States, Japan and Britain. That's no surprise. We are a large continent with lots of resources, when it comes to wind and sun. Consumers in Australia have got behind this. More than 2.2 million Australians have rooftop solar panels—the highest uptake anywhere in the world. This is, indeed, good news. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a smart country with a willing citizenry, we are poised to identify new economic challenges and opportunities, particularly for technologies that provide storage and backup to the electricity, industry and transport sectors. This bill supports just that. The Grid Reliability Fund will also support the government's commitment to the Underwriting New Generation Investments program to support eligible and viable projects that are within the CEFC's investment mandate. The bill will not change the CEFC's ability to make individual investment decisions independent of government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Gradually, coal-fired generators will leave the market to make way for new and innovative sources of energy generation. Many major energy companies are already making this energy transition. They will look to new flexible and dispatchable resources, such as pumped hydro and large-scale battery storage. However, as this transition takes place, gas will remain critical in its role in stabilising the grid, as has been identified by Australia's former Chief Scientist and chair of the Independent Review into the Future Security of the National Electricity Market, Dr Alan Finkel, a constituent of Higgins. This will allow the integration of renewable energies without compromising reliability and cost. In fact, in Dr Finkel's address to the National Press Club in February last year as Chief Scientist, he outlined the orderly transition to the 'electric planet', as he calls it, and that natural gas will play a critical role in that transition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around the globe, many nations are using national gas as a stable, cheap and low-emission electricity supply. Indeed, on home turf, South Australia has shifted from coal to an energy mix of solar and wind that sits at around 51 per cent. But, as we all know, when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining, natural gas supply stabilises the electricity supply in South Australia. We truly are at the dawn of a new and thriving industry, and, with government support from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, we will unlock these industries and support existing companies to shift to more renewable products and practices and to help new and emerging companies to enter the market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, I joined some of my parliamentary colleagues and visited the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, often referred to as ARENA. Through ARENA, ActewAGL has received $2.4 million in funding to demonstrate vehicle-to-grid services in Australia. This is very exciting technology. It's still in the research phase but vehicle-to-grid technology is, basically, a battery on wheels that allows electric vehicles to discharge electricity back to the grid or even provide services to improve grid security. If this is to come to fruition, this project will be the first time that a fleet of vehicles using bidirectional charges will supply the grid. It's hard to imagine, but it's talking about converting our fleet of cars on the road to a virtual power plant on the move. This, essentially, means that, in the future, every time we get behind the wheel of an electric vehicle, we'll be adding power back into the grid. This means lower emissions and better electricity security. This is certainly just one step on the journey to creating an emissions-free country, but this is an example of Australian home-grown technology leading the way and something that we as a country should be enormously proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government understands that to reach future targets and reduce overall emissions we need to set out a clear pathway for business to thrive, and we are doing this through innovation and technology, not taxes. This is being done through the national <span style="font-style:italic;">Technology Investment Roadmap</span>, a landmark paper that will drive investment in low-emission technology to strengthen our economy and support jobs and businesses. This will become more and more important as we start on the road to economic recovery from COVID-19. This road map will prioritise Australian government investments in new and developing technologies. Deploying the right technology when and where it is needed will allow Australian industry to capture these new opportunities. The road map will focus on some key points. These include developing technologies to support job growth, backing new industries to help regional communities and local economies to prosper, putting Australia at the forefront of research and development, and maintaining our strong track record of reducing global emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's climate action agenda is practical and it's clear-sighted, but it's driven by science and technology. It's driven by a clear understanding that science has come to our aid at many other times in a crisis and it will come to our aid again. There is enormous potential in technologies like hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, soil carbon sequestration, biofuels and resources and energy exports to reduce emissions whilst strengthening our economy. We will focus on technologies where we have a competitive advantage, in partnership with the private sector and like-minded countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government knows that a shift from our reliance on coal will not happen overnight. The road map outlines key technology opportunities for Australia in the short, medium and long term. In the short term, investment will be key. This will set a strong foundation for a future of lower emissions. In the medium term, energy storage and infrastructure will mean we are set for the future. A shift to electric vehicles will also become tangible, as costs come down as more competitors enter the market. This is about a free-market approach to the EV. Finally, in the long term, we will reach a stage where we are global players in low-emission resource exporting. As Dr Alan Finkel said in his National Press Club speech, and is often prone to say, it's about shipping sunshine as an export.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Business and industry will be poised to move operations like manufacturing to more carbon-neutral practices—there's even a possibility of investing in the development of small modular reactors or molten salt reactors. Indeed, small modular nuclear reactors, at half the construction cost of today's reactors, have been identified as a focus for US president Joe Biden's new climate tech R&amp;D agency, ARPA-C. In contrast, those opposite have dismissed nuclear energy as a fantasy. If we are going to get to a zero net carbon future, why have one arm tied behind our back? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the government released its first annual Low Emissions Technology Statement, and this is a key milestone of the road-map process—it's the first in Australia's history. It identified the following priority stretch goals, and these are important because they provide a pragmatic way to understand how technology will underpin the transition. The first of those five stretch goals is clean hydrogen at under $2 per kilogram. The second is energy storage electricity for firming at under $100 per megawatt hour. The third is low-carbon materials, including low-emission steel production at under $900 per tonne and low-emission aluminium at under $2,700 per tonne. The fourth is carbon dioxide compression, hubs transport and storage at under $20 per tonne of CO2, and the fifth, which is great for farmers, is soil carbon measurement at under $3 per hectare per year. These are all pragmatic ambitions for our country to drive jobs, help our economy and get us to a clean and green future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an incredibly exciting time to witness and be part of the new generation of energy production in Australia. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will continue to be at the forefront of encouraging investment innovation and bravery within the renewables space. As a scientist who believes in technology and innovation, I commend this bill to the House. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Amendment (Grid Reliability Fund) Bill 2020. I do so echoing the position of the member for McMahon and following the contribution of the member for Higgins. I know there are others across the aisle who are receiving a lot of heat from their electorate and a lot of demands to be a part of some of the solutions around climate change and lowering our emissions, but the reason why they have no credibility and why the small group of MPs on the other side of the House who dress themselves up in modernity are so uncomfortable is that they keep bowling up bills like this. I'm going to go through this bill and go through the amendments that the Labor Party is going to put forward, and I'm going to reiterate the point that, if the Labor Party is unsuccessful in getting our amendments through this place and through the Senate, we will not be supporting the bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Clean Energy Finance Corporation was a creation of the Gillard government—a proud legacy of the Gillard government—and it was designed, as you may guess, to finance clean energy. It got this fancy name because it was really designed to boost renewables and low-emission technologies in Australia. The other thing it was meant to do was to do this in a way that made money, in a way that was economically viable. Its projects were to stand up with the support of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation in a way such that the corporation wouldn't just be expending but would also be getting a return on investment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill that is before the House goes to the very fabric of what the Clean Energy Finance Corporation was all about. This bill contains amendments to make it so that it doesn't invest in just clean energy or low-emission technology, and it does it in a way that tries to remove some of the financial requisites in order to fund projects. They want to turn the Clean Energy Finance Corporation into the 'not such good investment on any sort of technology' corporation. They want to take the 'clean energy' and the 'finance' out of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It would be laughable if it weren't so shocking. It is clear why this small group of so-called modern Liberals are so uncomfortable with their position on climate change; it's because the government keeps bowling up bills like this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first thing to point out is that, since the corporation's inception, the federal government—the coalition—have, at every stage, tried to undermine the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. They have attacked it at every opportunity, and this is just the latest iteration. The first thing we are opposing in this bill is the provision relating to ministerial power. This bill seeks to introduce provisions that mean that, instead of the corporation having to make investment decisions based on factors like whether or not a project involves clean energy or is financially viable, the minister will have the power to supersede the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We didn't hear anything from the member for Higgins about the ministerial power amendments in this bill, and I'm sure we're not going to hear anything from subsequent speakers about why it's such a good idea to give the current Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction power to overrule and intercept the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen time and time again why this government can't be trusted to manage the taxpayer funds of Australia. We saw the sports rorts saga where, instead of funding eligible sporting clubs, ministers intervened and funded clubs based on where they fit in the marginal seat spreadsheet, in collaboration with the Prime Minister's office. We've seen this minister for energy be far more distracted with interventions and downloads from the City of Sydney website, creating wars with Clover Moore. Most recently, we've seen the Minister for Home Affairs use his ministerial discretion on the Safer Communities Fund—the fund that is literally designed to protect our vulnerable communities. This is something I have a lot of experience with, having been involved in the design and also the rollout of some of the iterations of this program and having some of the vulnerable communities in my electorate. These are communities that are deemed at risk not by the whim of a minister but by our policing agencies and by our intelligence and security agencies. Instead of funding the eligible projects under that program, ministerial intervention resulted in the current Minister for Home Affairs investing in projects based on the seat's marginality. If a seat can be the basis on which a minister makes a decision, who knows what sort of ministerial intervention there will be in regard to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that one of the biggest indications is the fact that this government wants to insert gas into the Clean Energy Finance Corporation capable technologies. I absolutely reiterate the words from the member for McMahon: gas has a role. It is a feature. Those who work in our gas production and gas pipelines are good and great Australians who work hard, contribute to our economy and do noble work. But what we're talking about here is whether or not the Clean Energy Finance Corporation should invest in technology that isn't clean or low emissions technology. It's a fact of science that gas is not a low emissions technology; it is an emissions intensive technology. While it still has a role to play in our economy for the foreseeable future, it is a fact that it shouldn't be underwritten by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We will move an amendment to say that the ministers should not be able to intercept the decision-making of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and that this is a body that should be independent from government and should be making decisions based on strict criteria around whether or not it achieves low-emissions standards. We, on this side of the House, believe that gas should not be a part of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final amendment really grinds my gears. To be honest, I think we all expected this government to attack the 'clean energy' part of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation—that would be true to form—but the finance bit really tells you a little bit about where this government is at. Not only are they wanting to tackle the clean energy bit and take the 'clean energy' bit out of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation but they want to soften and lower the financial requirements around positive returns from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Let me get this straight: they want to make a reform to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation by taking out the standards around clean energy and they want to do it in order to make it so that it doesn't get proper returns on investment. You couldn't make two more terrible changes to an act that is literally designed to do the exact opposite. The finance corporation is named in a way that is designed to show what it's all about, and this government wants to change it. They want to remove the 'clean' bit, the 'energy' bit and the 'finance' bit. They're leaving 'corporation' though—thank goodness! Or maybe they're not; who knows?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, on this side of the House, say that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation should stick to its original principles as set out by the Gillard Labor government. It is a fund of government to help drive new and exciting technologies that are going to create jobs. We know that tackling climate change, taking action on climate change, is going to create jobs in this country. The new industries that are going to power Australia and help us develop into the next century are going to be jobs from the moving and low-emission technology that we are talking about today. What this government wants to do—and what will be the legacy of this government—is remove the requirements around clean energy and remove the requirements around the financial return in a way that gives the minister responsibility on the decisions. Well, it's hardly surprising that the minister wants those things taken out for his decisions. He wants to make decisions that result in bad financial outcomes and that don't invest in clean energy. That sums up this government pretty well: bad financial decisions and not investing in clean energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final thing I want to say as I wrap up is about a comment made by the member for Higgins around nuclear energy. I'm guessing the member for Higgins doesn't flag that too often in her conversations with her local environment groups, but I can certainly say that, while we stand open on this side of the House to look at the technology advancements of nuclear technology as they unfold, right now the only technology that nuclear energy has are the large-scale nuclear reactors. That's the only thing that is there now that we can safely look at. If we were to build a large-scale nuclear reactor in Australia, it would take at least 15, maybe 20, years. It would cost somewhere in the vicinity of $10 billion to $15 billion. It's not viable. Ziggy Switkowski has had a look at this in great detail, and we have had a look at this as part of our environment and energy committee. It is just not feasible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is a wonderful reminder of the need to look for the projects that are cheaper, that are more cost effective and that are going to give us that rate of return. Nuclear energy isn't even in the conversation. It's the most expensive form of energy, and that hasn't changed even without all of the technological advancements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the other thing to say about nuclear energy is that small modular reactors, which are obviously the talked-about emerging technology, are something that those on that side of the House like to fawn over. Well, they don't exist. If anyone can point me to a factory that's building modular reactors in the world right now, I'll buy your lunch. It doesn't exist. Small modular reactors aren't a thing yet. They might be in a decade—small modular reactors may become a thing. At the moment, NuScale has just pushed back its rollout of its first prototype to the end of the 2020s; it may even be to the start of 2030. It was meant to be delivered in 2026. They're often the prime example of this sort of modular prototype of a nuclear reactor that can be built in a factory. But, unless you're talking about the nuclear reactors that exist on submarines—and those are not 'modular'; they're just small reactors—they just don't exist. And they certainly don't exist without a military or government budget; I can assure the members of this House of that simple fact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite come at this debate obviously uncomfortable from the pressure that they're feeling from their electorate, but they need not look at their electorate to realise why they're uncomfortable. They need to look at the legislation they keep bowling into the House of Representatives. The reason those modern Liberals on that side are so uncomfortable with the state of play of this government is: when we're talking about the opportunities of government, when we're talking about legacy in this place, when we're talking about the future of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, what is their answer? Their answer is to rip out the 'clean energy' bit and to rip out the 'finance' bit and to give the current Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction free rein to make bad decisions that don't lower emissions and that reduce your financial return on investment in energy. It couldn't be a worse return.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, unless the amendments that are moved by the Labor Party pass this place, we will not be supporting this bill. And we stand ready to fight the awful legacy that is being left by this government which has no faith and no belief in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHARMA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  It's a pleasure to talk today on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Amendment (Grid Reliability Fund) Bill 2020, but first I did want to thank my colleague the member for Macnamara for his concern for my welfare and wellbeing and I did want to assure him and others opposite that I'm entirely comfortable and relaxed—in fact, enthusiastic—about the government's energy policies and I feel entirely comfortable, relaxed and enthusiastic in explaining and articulating those to my constituents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is an important bill but, to understand why we are here, it's important to understand the journey, the story of how we got here, and it's the story of the energy transition that's underway in Australia. I know that this inflames passions amongst many people, but, to me, it has a sense of historical inevitability to it. It's like many of the industrial or energy transitions that humanity has been through before, in many iterations of our history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This journey in Australia is underway at quite a remarkable rate. It was just a few weeks ago that the Clean Energy Regulator estimated that a record amount of seven gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity was installed in Australia last year. That is a record. It beats by 11 per cent the figure for 2019, of 6.3 gigawatts, and that 2019 figure was itself a record, beating the previous record of 2018, and on it goes. The increase in renewable energy capacity in Australia is underway at an exponential rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been, by and large, a solar installation boom that has driven this new record—notwithstanding the fact that COVID-19 restrictions did impact on the ability of solar rooftop installations to continue throughout last year. We're now in a situation in Australia where 2.2 million Australian homes, or roughly one in four Australian homes, have solar, which is the highest uptake of household solar anywhere in the world. In fact, in 2019, the last year for which these sorts of figures are available, Australia deployed new renewable energy capacity at least 10 times faster per person than the global average and four times faster per person than market countries such as Europe or the United States or China. It was 10 times faster than the global average and four times faster than OECD countries. In 2020, Australia invested $7.7 billion, or $299 per person, in renewable energy. This places us ahead of countries like Canada, Germany, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and the United States on a per-person basis. In fact, Australia now has the highest solar capacity per person of any country in the world, at 644 watts per person, and the highest wind and solar capacity of any country outside of Europe, at 804 watts per person. These are all good stories. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last quarter of 2020, the share of renewables in the national electricity market—the main electricity market taking in most of the eastern states of Australia—exceeded 30 per cent, which is another first. In 2020, a record 53.6 terawatt hours of electricity was generated from renewables, including rooftop solar, in the national electricity market. Again, this is 16 per cent higher than the previous record, which was set in 2019. The strong investment in renewables is forecast to continue. Australia is projected to deploy an additional 24 gigawatts of rooftop solar by 2030. That's on top of the 6.3 gigawatts we installed in 2019 and the seven gigawatts in 2020. That will mean a tripling of the nation's small-scale solar generating capacity over the course of a decade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The important lesson from all of this, I think, is that progress here is not linear; it's exponential. If you look at the years 2007 to 2013, for instance, when those opposite were in government, the policy imperative to switch to renewables was just as high but the technology was not as cheap, not as widely available and not as commercially competitive. In that six year period we managed to install a total of 5.6 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity—5.6 gigawatts over six years. Last year we installed seven gigawatts, the year before that we installed 6.3 gigawatts and in the next six years we expect to install another 24 gigawatts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The story is positive elsewhere too. In the year to June 2020, emissions fell three per cent to their lowest level since 1998, and our emissions now are nearly 17 per cent below our 2005 levels. If you want to compare that figure to elsewhere, the OECD average for emissions reductions across the same period is nine per cent; in New Zealand it's one per cent and in Canada it's less than one per cent. As members here would know, our Paris emissions reduction target is 26 to 28 per cent below our 2005 emissions levels by 2030. The year is 2021, and we are already down 17 per cent on our 2005 levels; we are more than halfway there. It's clear to me that we will be able to meet our Paris emissions reduction target and that we will be able to do this without use of our Kyoto credits—which, I hasten to add, were legitimately earned by virtue of the fact that we beat our 2020 target by 459 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This energy transition that is underway in Australia—and it is a remarkable story of transition—is not being driven by government fiat, new taxes or the exhaustion of fossil fuels. Like nearly every other major economic and energy transition that we've been through in our history, as a species, this transition is being driven by the availability and affordability of new technology, by commercial imperatives, by consumer appetite and by investor sentiment. The bill we are debating and discussing today, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Amendment (Grid Reliability Fund) Bill 2020, is another step in this direction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was in October 2019 that the government announced the introduction of a new $1 billion Grid Reliability Fund. This fund, which will be administered by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, will support investments in new energy generation, storage and transmission infrastructure, including eligible projects short-listed under the Underwriting New Generation Investments program. The CEFC Grid Reliability Fund bill will amend the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012 in order to implement and create the Grid Reliability Fund. Specifically, it will establish a $1 billion Grid Reliability Fund through a new special account, to be administered by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and allow for permits for regulations to expand this appropriation in the future so we can put more money into this fund. It also establishes a new category of Grid Reliability Fund investments, which are to be funded from this GRF special account. The GRF, the Grid Reliability Fund, will enable the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to invest in additional energy generation, storage, transmission and distribution infrastructure and grid-stabilising technologies. This will provide, over time, for greater affordability, reliability, stability and security of the electricity system, ensuring that, as we transition to more renewable energy in the grid, we combat intermittency and we ensure that the power provided is reliable and affordable. Providing the CEFC with an additional $1 billion will benefit energy market participants by providing a trusted counterparty for grid reliability investments and allowing the government to leverage private sector involvement and investment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Grid Reliability Fund will help ensure that Australia's world-leading deployment of renewables is integrated and backed up. As I said, it will support private investment in storage and transmission infrastructure and new reliable energy generation. As Australia recovers from COVID-19, affordable and reliable power will be critical to growing the economy and creating new jobs. Equally, for our survival as a nation and a species, it is important that we continue the transition to a lower emissions future. Australia's experience throughout this has been that, when new technologies become economically competitive, households and businesses rapidly adopt them. We are seeing that firsthand with renewables right now. On an energy-only basis, costs have fallen rapidly, and we've seen $30 billion invested in renewable energy since 2017. As I said earlier, Australia is now deploying new wind and solar 10 times faster per person than the global average and four times faster per person than places like China, Japan, the United States and Europe. One in four Australian households have solar panels on the roof or elsewhere around the home. In 2019 the share of wind and solar in Australia's electricity grids was more than double the global average, and it is projected to rise rapidly in coming years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, all of this renewable energy in the grid brings new challenges. While there's no shortage of investment in clean energy, the government has identified a lack of investment in the dispatchable generation needed to support the increase of intermittent generation. We need more flexible backup generation and storage, pumped hydro, batteries and, yes, gas to balance and integrate high shares of renewable energy. By focusing on getting the cost of new technologies down, we won't raise the cost of incumbent technologies, like coal and gas, that continue to play an important role in the energy mix. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Grid Reliability Fund will work alongside the government's Technology Investment Roadmap to ensure affordable and reliable energy for all Australians while reducing our emissions. Eligible investments will include energy storage projects like pumped hydro and batteries, transmission and distribution infrastructure, grid-stabilising technologies and other eligible projects identified in the government's Underwriting New Generation Investments project. Importantly, the fund will not divert the CEFC's existing $10 billion allocation away from clean energy projects. The Grid Reliability Fund is $1 billion on top of that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some examples of projects that the Grid Reliability Fund could support in New South Wales include the creation of renewable energy zones, like the proposed Orana REZ; upgrades or extensions of the transmission network to support improved interregional trade and the reliability of grid stability; and dispatchable generation projects, like the UNGI short-listed Armidale pumped hydro project or the Port Kembla gas project. In Tasmania, projects that could be supported include the Marinus Link and the Battery of the Nation renewable pumped hydro projects. In South Australia, projects like Project EnergyConnect, the Baroota Pumped Hydro Project and the Reeves Plains gas project could be supported. In Victoria, projects could include improved transmission infrastructure projects, like the proposed VNI West project, and dispatchable generation projects, like the Bairnsdale gas upgrade or the proposed Dandenong power station. In Queensland, projects could include new transmission projects, such as CopperString 2.0, and dispatchable generation projects, like the proposed Cressbrook reservoir pumped hydro project near Toowoomba. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know those opposite have difficulty with gas. They have difficulty with fossil fuels more generally. It's the case at the moment that coal continues to provide roughly 60 per cent of our power generation in Australia, and, whilst that percentage will undoubtedly lessen over time, it will remain an important part of our energy mix for the future. Anyone who follows this issue closely and invests it with the seriousness it deserves understands that, until such time as large-scale storage projects come down in cost, particularly battery technology or potentially hydrogen, we are going to be relying on gas to play more of a role in firming our grid and to allow the transition to a cleaner future, where renewables play a bigger role. That's the simple fact. The Chief Scientist, Alan Finkel, has laid this out quite clearly. Until at least 2030, possibly longer, we will need gas as a stabilising force within the grid to allow us to put more renewables into the grid and ensure that intermittency does not become an issue. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally, I am an optimist about our ability as humans, as a species, to overcome some of the challenges that are placed before us. I don't think this is by any stretch the greatest challenge we've faced. There was Thomas Malthus's prediction that famine was an inevitable part of the human condition and would permanently limit the population of the earth. When Thomas Malthus wrote this in 1798, the world's population was 800 million people. Today it is 6.7 billion people, and on average they are much better nourished and much better fed, with much better life expectancy and a much better quality of life. Or there were the worries in the 1990s about the rapid depletion of the ozone layer. When the ozone hole was first discovered in 1982 it caused panic at the time, and rightly so, but today—you'd have to look this up because it's not in the news any more—the hole in the ozone layer is the smallest since it was first discovered in 1982.</span>

I would like to see Australia do it. I'd like to see us do it sooner if possible. As the Prime Minister said in his Press Club address earlier in the week, we need to focus not on the what but on the how. It will ultimately be the commercial availability of technology that drives this—our success in engineering new industrial methods, our ability to create renewable liquid fuels, our vision in reengineering our transport system, our success in creating new carbon sinks in the soil and elsewhere. These are fundamentally practical challenges of the sort we have overcome many times in our history. If we solve for these, we solve for net zero. So let's focus our efforts here.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  This is a slush fund for big gas corporations. That's what the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Amendment (Grid Reliability Fund) Bill 2020 is. The government that says, 'Technology, not taxes; we've got to let the market decide,' is about to open up the $10 billion that exists in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and make it available to big gas corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that gas is as dirty as coal. We know that methane, which leaks and is released into the atmosphere when you start fracking under good farmland and land across Australia, is up to 86 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas. We know that, if we unleash the gas in the Beetaloo Basin or in other places around Australia, we can say goodbye to making our contribution to giving our kids a safe climate to live in. We know that the technology is there now, with renewables and storage, to drive a clean energy revolution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what does this bill do? This bill comes in and says, 'Let's make public money available for gas corporations.' I notice the members on the other side have gone very quiet about this. For all their free market rhetoric, they cannot wait to shovel billions of dollars out the door to give to their mates in the gas corporations—the same corporations who turn around and donate to them. The biggest gas corporations in this country over the last few years brought in about $50 billion in revenue and paid zero tax. They did make some donations. They made donations to the government and they made some donations to the Labor Party, but they paid zero tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think the starting point with big corporations that are contributing to wrecking our planet should be, 'Pay some tax on the massive superprofits you are making and contribute a bit to the cost of dealing with the climate crisis.' But, no, this supposed free market government, that says it loves technology and won't want to interfere in the unleashing of technology, is about to take the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the $10 billion that is there to drive the uptake of clean technologies in Australia and make it available to dirty, polluting gas and toxic methane. How is it going to do that? This bill changes the definition of what counts, effectively, as clean energy and what counts as low-emissions technology and expands it to explicitly include gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just think about this for a moment. We have been told that the decisions we make in the next 10 years will determine whether we get the climate crisis under control. It is a matter of science that we are rapidly heading towards the edge of a cliff. If we go over that 2030 cliff, you can have all the 2050 targets in the world you like, and all the aspirations of getting there, but it will be too late. By that point, climate change will have become an unstoppable chain reaction and we won't be able to rein it in. On current forecasts, which the government blithely accepts, by the end of the century, during my daughter's lifetime, we are heading for an Australia that will be heated by more than four degrees. In a four-degree world, there is carrying capacity on this planet for a billion people. Going from 7½ billion people down to one billion people is an extraordinary amount of war and devastation and conflict. That is what is facing us. On the government's forecasts, that is the temperature we are heading towards unless we act in the next 10 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why, in the next 10 years, we need to massively invest in renewables and come up with a plan to put coal and gas out of the system. But what's the government doing? The government brings on a bill and says, 'We want to change the definition of clean energy to include gas.' President Biden and his climate envoy, John Kerry, have got it right. They've said that, at this stage, new gas infrastructure is not only going to end up as stranded assets but is massively counterproductive and will get in the way of us tackling the climate challenge. They've said very, very clearly that there is no space for new investment in gas if we want to stay within our carbon budget and avoid going over that climate cliff. That's what the United States government has said and it is what scientists have said. And they are right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what does this government do? Instead of coming in and saying, 'Let's have a plan to phase it out,' they're saying, 'Let's take public funds and give them to the gas corporations that pay no tax at the moment and make massive super profits.' This is a subsidy for big corporations that pay no tax and pollute and kill our planet. Why are they getting this money? It's because they make donations. They make donations to the Liberal Party, the Labor Party and the National Party—millions of dollars of donations—and they get their way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's even more astonishing is that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is making a profit at the moment. It is investing in clean energy technologies, and that's the future. And it is making a return to government. This government wants to turn a profit-making Clean Energy Finance Corporation into a venture that invests in losing money on gas. The government knows that public subsidies for gas are the only way gas is going to be profitable, so it is turning a profit-making corporation into something that is going to start losing money on its gas investments—because it wants to bankroll them, and it wants to bankroll gas investments. The government knows that no-one in their right mind is looking at investing in new fossil fuel investments, so they come to the government with their hand out and this government of largesse and donations and subsidies for big corporations is giving money to them. It is not asking these big corporations to pay more tax. Instead, it is giving them massive public subsidies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm waiting for the spirited defence from the member for Goldstein about why there are massive subsidies going to big corporations in his supposedly free market. I'm not hearing very much. All the free market 'technology, not taxes' rhetoric dissolves into dust when it comes to subsidising their big corporate mates. Big corporations have too much power over politicians. They exercise that power through political donations and, in return, they get things like this bill—a massive multibillion-dollar slush fund for big gas. And yet people wonder why the cost of going to the doctor keeps going up or why, when you send your kid to a public school, you get hit with all these voluntary school fees, and what is meant to be a free education turns out to be far from it. Why is everyone else having to pay more? Because these big corporations get away with paying no tax. And, instead of rectifying it, the government is about to give them even more public money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are going to move to amend this, to stop this being turned into the minister's slush fund for gas. We will move to amend this. This government has never seen a fund that it didn't rort. This government loves rorting. The minister in question, the minister for energy, has a very dubious relationship with figures and data. So we are going to move to amend this bill so that the minister does not have the power to tell the independent Clean Energy Finance Corporation how to spend its money and so that the minister cannot come along and say, 'I am going to define gas and maybe even coal as a low-emissions technology.' We are going to stop the minister from being able to do that. And we are going to say to the minister that, if he really wants to take public money and put it into a new coal- or gas-fired power station, as he is regularly on the front page of various papers saying he wants to do, he should come back with a separate piece of legislation. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is the 'Clean' Energy Finance Corporation. Don't try and use it as another slush fund for corporate mates to funnel money back to gas corporations. That is what he is proposing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Clean Energy Finance Corporation was set up by the Greens and Labor in the power-sharing parliament of 2010. This government has tried to destroy it. This government tried to wipe out all of that legacy. The only time pollution in this country meaningfully came down was when the Greens, Labor and Independents worked together and put a price on pollution and put in place the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, put in place the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and put in place things like the Carbon Farming Initiative. It has worked. The government tried to get rid of the CEFC. The government does not want this body to exist. The government does not want there to be a profitable government owned organisation that helps clean technologies expand. This is what the Clean Energy Finance Corporation does. It was established to say, 'When these new technologies that are invented pass the proof-of-concept space and turn out to be viable propositions, we will use public funds to help them grow and become self-sustaining businesses.' And it has worked. The CEFC has invested $8.2 billion of public money to generate $29 billion of new economic activity to support jobs and infrastructure and to bring new clean energy technologies online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The technology that the Prime Minister loves talking about doesn't come out of nowhere. It comes out of organisations like the CEFC supporting researchers and businesses to take their ideas and turn them into viable commercial enterprises. That is what the CEFC is there for. Because renewables are the future and the fuel is free, the CEFC by investing the money has made $1.7 billion in profit from carefully chosen investments, money that actually goes straight back to the government's bottom line. So the CEFC is using public funds to take really good ideas in the renewables and clean energy space and help grow them into viable and thriving businesses. It makes money for the government, because when the businesses make money they pay some back. It is a terrific idea, and that is why the Greens, Labor and the Independents established it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government wants to repeal it. It has tried time and time again to repeal it. Because it has been unsuccessful in repealing it, it is now coming back with a different approach. The different approach is to say: 'We know that the public likes renewables and we know that this thing set up by the Greens, Labor and the Independents has been a roaring success and the public wants it. We can't repeal it anymore, so what are we going to do? We are going to change it. We are going to make the money available to the gas corporations. We are going to make it so that there's less money available for renewables and more money available for dirty fuel.' The thing that needs underlining is that the government is now hanging onto the CEFC and ARENA and saying, 'Look at these wonderful things that we are doing.' President Scott Morrison is telling Joe Biden, 'Don't worry; I have the CEFC and ARENA here'—</span>

                    </a>  I thought I did. The Prime Minister is telling Joe Biden we've got all these wonderful things. He doesn't tell him that we tried to repeal them. What he doesn't say is that the only thing this government, in all the time since it's been elected, has that wasn't a Greens or Labor idea is its Emissions Reduction Fund, which has saved barely 200 million tonnes of abatement over its lifetime. The CEFC alone, last year, brought in 250 million tonnes. And the government's Emissions Reduction Fund involves the public paying the polluters whereas things like the CEFC make money by growing new technology and new businesses.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why on earth would you want to tinker with that and take money away from renewables and make it available to the gas and coal and dirty fuel corporations? There can only be two answers. One is that you don't seriously believe in climate change—and we heard from the Deputy Prime Minister that he doesn't care what happens in 30 years time. He doesn't care if we go over that cliff and our kids are left to pick up the mess. So we understand why the government is moving this bill. It is because they don't care what's going to happen in 30 years time. The only other reason you'd do it is that your big corporate donors have asked you to. Those big corporate donors, that pay zero dollars in tax, aren't being asked by this government to pay their fair share. Instead, they're being given more handouts. It's time to say enough of the handouts for the big corporations. The big corporations and the billionaires need to pay their fair share of tax. They need to pay a bit more so that everyone else can pay a bit less. That's going to start by amending this bill.</span>

I went and did the research. Lo and behold, there is a floating SMR, Akademik Lomonosov, in the north-east region of Russia, right now, and it's used for the purpose of water desalinisation—the power of technology utilised to build the future and hydrate the planet and desalinate water.

Don't get me wrong. As bad as the member for Macnamara is, he's not as bad as the ineffectual Marxist member for Melbourne, who's a science denier on genetically enhanced food and a science denier on nuclear power. And Senator Hanson-Young, in the other place, is now talking about how the Greens party is being infiltrated by anti-vaxxers, vaccine deniers, who are starting to look at the Greens party and go, 'They really don't like science technology, progress and building the future of this country.' </span>

                    </a>  I hear the derision they throw towards gas. Clearly, the Marxist member for Melbourne has never been to a factory in his life. Go out the back of the Goldstein electorate and to parts of Hotham and parts of Isaacs and go to those factories that melt metals as part of their business. Do you know what fuel they use to melt the metal? It's gas. So you can rant and rave as much as you want about how you can't support it, about how you can't have it as part of the economy, but it's a critical part of the manufacturing base, including to do things like build components for electric cars. That's exactly what they do. But you can't do it. What are you going to do? Are you going to melt metals with the burning flames of what comes out of wind power or solar power? It's simply absurd. We've got to look at a mix of technologies. What we're trying to do in this bill is build a reliable energy base for the nation, and we should be holding on to that. When the Marxist member for Melbourne gets up here and says that he's so antinuclear and won't support it under any circumstances, even though he says there is a climate crisis, it shows you that he's prepared to shove other things in front of it and it's a dishonest statement. He doesn't actually believe it. He is not committed to it. He's an antinuclear activist who's not actually campaigning on climate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Last week I was honoured to visit the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre at its dedicated facility at Darwin airport and later at its Howard Springs operation. The centre had previously been hosted at Royal Darwin Hospital, and it still has an important presence there. It was established, you'll recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, after the dreadful and horrific 2002 terrorist bombings in Bali, in which so many Australians lost their lives. Funded by the Australian government, the centre is focused on enhancing Australia's capacity to provide clinical and academic leadership in disaster and trauma care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The centre provides an internationally unique crisis and disaster response capability. It has been coordinating our COVID response for Australians who are overseas. A team from the centre looked after the Australians evacuated from China's epicentre at Wuhan in February 2020, as well as the evacuated passengers off the <span style="font-style:italic;">Diamond Princess</span> cruise ship after the coronavirus outbreak on board off Japan. The centre has had staff deployed on 21 occasions in a range of international operations, principally through South-East Asia and the Pacific and locally in Australia. It is a strategically important asset. It looks after those repatriated Australians arriving each week for quarantine at Howard Springs. The centre is by any measure a unique national gem which all Australians should be proud of. It's a fantastic tribute to the brilliance, professionalism, commitment and knowledge of Len Notaras and his magnificent team of clinicians, administrators, researchers, logisticians and the many other skill sets that are engaged. I can't go past the need to acknowledge Michelle Foster, who has been on the ride with Len from the outset. We owe them all a tremendous debt of gratitude.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of my visit was to the Centre for National Resilience at Howard Springs under the care of the Australian Medical Assistance Team, or AUSMAT, which is coordinated by the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre. It has been 12 months since our first COVID evacuees arrived at the Howard Springs facility. Since repatriation flights to the Northern Territory began on 23 October 2020, 3,780 international arrivals have undertaken quarantine at the Howard Springs Centre for National Resilience. Sixty-five positive COVID-19 cases have been reported among those repatriated there. It is through the exceptional management under the leadership and guidance of Abigail Trewin, who has directed the disaster preparedness and response—a true international star—that there has been not one case of community transmission. The professional facilities are an absolute credit to the Territory team involved and the clinicians who have come from around Australia to undertake this important work—people such as Dr Alex Swann, a specialist from Western Australia who I had the great pleasure of meeting during my visit. I learned a great deal and was overawed by the depth of knowledge and expertise that has been developed at Howard Springs. They clearly are the gold standard. The fastidiousness and professionalism shown by the team in dealing with those in their care have made a significant contribution to the protection of all of us from the spread of this insidious virus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An absolute bonus of the trip to Howard Springs was meeting with the indefatigable Karen Sheldon and her wonderful catering team, who are providing meals for the Australians returning and in quarantine. Karen's team of largely First Nations staff, including chefs and cooks, are serving up three meals a day to over 800 people plus staff. As you would expect if you know Karen, these meals are inspired by the Territory but seek to cater to the tastes of those in quarantine. All are prepared on site. I can personally vouch for their quality, having sampled one last week. But most telling was the pride shown by those First Nations employees, who, thanks to the training they are receiving, are doing such great work for the whole community. They make a significant and not-to-be-underestimated contribution to the success and reputation of the Howard Springs quarantine facility.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians should be proud of the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre. It's done fantastic work for all of us and for many of our neighbours.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  Today, in this place and also in the Federation Chamber, much has been said about the plight of our nation's travel agents, and justifiably so. There are some 40,000 people in the industry, 80 per cent of whom are women, and 60 per cent of the businesses of those travel agents are in regional and rural Australia. They were the first to be hit by this pandemic, and they'll be the last to come out of this pandemic. We have an obligation as a government to support them, and we have. I've spoken to literally hundreds of them over the past six months, and they were very, very grateful for JobKeeper, they were very grateful for the $128 million support package, and they were very hopeful that, in a bipartisan approach, we can see our way to an industry-specific support package in line with the continuation of a JobKeeper style. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is something else we can do as a government—again, in a bipartisan way—that will assist not only the travel agents but also service providers such as hotels, resorts et cetera, and that's by shining a light on online travel agencies such as Trivago, Expedia, Wotif, Skyscanner, Booking.com, Airbnb and Kayak. They're all based in Germany or the USA or are Chinese owned. They do not have the same obligations as travel agents in Australia, in that they don't have to disclose their commissions when they accept a booking. Our travel agents have to tell the client, 'My commission is 10 per cent, and that's reflected in the invoice.' Online travel agents don't have to disclose that, they don't have to disclose where that money's going to and they do not pay tax in our country. We need to do everything we possibly can to educate the public on that fact. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to move the goalposts for online travel agents to make it fair for our travel agents. They take tens of billions of dollars a year from the pockets of our travel agents and our service providers. If we can educate the public by legislating that online travel agents must disclose what their commissions are and where they are based, that should change the way of thinking of people who book online. They will say, 'Well, I'm not paying $3,000 of my money to a German based or Chinese based company; I'm going to go straight to the accommodation service provider and book with them, or, if I want the security of booking through a travel agent, I'll book through an Australian based local travel agent for 10 per cent, because that's all they charge.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A fellow emailed me and took a screenshot of his account. He was very grateful for a $3,000 grant from the New South Wales government, but, two entries below, you could see this: 'Booking.com BV, Amsterdam, 13 July 2020, $3,272.60'. In one fell swoop, there goes the $3,000 from the New South Wales government, straight into the pockets of a big corporate in Amsterdam. He said to me: 'I don't mind paying commission for people doing work, but it must be fair. Ten per cent—I'm happy with that. But these companies charge up to 25 or 30 per cent commission on top of what people pay.' That's not fair. If our travel agents have to disclose what their commissions are, where they're based and have to comply with all these other transparency rules, then it is only fair that we as a government ensure that online travel agents are subject to the same obligations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264170" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Most of us love a trip to the movies—the smell of popcorn, the choc-top and the big screen. Last week I visited Scotty's Cinemas in Raymond Terrace in my electorate of Paterson. I was pleased to meet Scott Seddon, president of Independent Cinemas Australia and proprietor of Scotty's Cinemas in Raymond Terrace and the famous Heddon Greta Drive In in my home town. Accompanying Scott was Neil Merrin, proprietor of Nelson Bay Cinemas, and Brenda, a resident and local movie buff. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scott reached out to my office at the start of the pandemic last year. His business was in trouble with the pressure of COVID restrictions. Scott has a long history of working in the cinema industry and understood that independent cinema would be hit hard. Scott understood the solution. Labor understands the solution. At the time, the union movement, our Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, and many of us on this side called the government to follow global trends and implement an immediate wage subsidy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know some of those opposite—not all, but some—want to rewrite history. They want to pretend that they showed up on day one with this magnificent idea called JobKeeper. Well, that's actually not quite how it happened. Those opposite would remember the calls for a wage subsidy. They would remember the New Zealand Labour government announcing a wage subsidy. They would remember the pleas from us on the Labor side, the pleas from small and large business, to finally make the government act. And, woe betide, those queues at Centrelink certainly tipped them over the edge. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the PM came up with the quirky label 'JobKeeper'—and, sure, he's good at spin; we can give him that. However, those opposite are so quick to forget that we have this fantastic resource called <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> and it's all there for everyone to read. Those opposite can spin it all they like, but the facts are the facts. It almost seems like it's in the DNA of the Liberals to never learn from past mistakes. Why are they refusing to extend JobKeeper? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many small businesses are still crying out for help, and independent cinema is a case in point. It's two extremes with this government. They allow the subsidy to be so broad that it's pumped money into multimillion-dollar companies, allowing them to turn healthy profits, but then they want to refuse continued support for vulnerable small businesses like independent cinema. The arrogance of this PM to say, 'We're not running a blank cheque budget,' when they've tripled the national debt before the pandemic and while the PM was our Treasurer! The fact is that many industries are still doing it tough. Small businesses across the hospitality, entertainment and tourism sectors are all in desperate need of sustainable support—until we get on the other side of this pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I visited Scotty's Cinemas and spoke with Neil last week, he told me that he currently employs 12 staff. That's 12 local jobs. Those are jobs that are tied to our COVID recovery. He told me that his local cinema has serviced our community for over 40 years and that, without the wage subsidy, it may have been lost to our community forever. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent cinemas like Nelson Bay Cinemas have employed hundreds of locals over the years and offered endless hours of entertainment to families across our community. Local ventures like Nelson Bay Cinemas and Scotty's Cinemas cater for all ages and, without these cinemas, locals would find it difficult to travel for entertainment. These local independent cinemas are vital to the identity of our regional communities and they sell our local stories too. Once we lose them, they're going to be gone for good and we can't afford that. Small businesses must be supported. The small independent cinema industry must be supported. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Fletcher is bragging that this government is pouring millions of dollars into the film industry, but that's exactly the problem. They want to brag and subsidise the wages of actors and enable movies to be made here; they're just too short-sighted to realise that cinemas are the critical end of the business cycle—the last three feet, as it's often known. If you don't have the screens, you don't have customers. Let me tell you: independent cinema has survived radio, TV, colour TV, Beta, VHS, DVD, pay TV and streaming, but will it survive Minister Fletcher? That is the absolute question. Support your local cinemas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="7K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ENTSCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I rise this evening to pay tribute to the businesses across my electorate. Like many others across the nation, they face challenges like never before. Far North Queensland, especially Cairns and Port Douglas, was the first region in the nation to be severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Sadly, we'll also be among the last to recover. The latest figures reflect this, with 16,617 Cairns workers still on JobKeeper payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tourism is the No. 1 economic driver for our city and our region. In good years Cairns generates more than $3.5 billion in tourism dollars. Last year that figure was less than $1.5 billion. That is a pretty stark figure in anyone's book. While some might say, 'It's just a figure,' it's far more than just that. That staggering drop in tourism dollars represents the livelihood of somebody's mum, dad, sister, brother, aunty, uncle or other loved one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is absolutely committed to working with the sector to address the challenges that have emerged and continue to emerge during COVID-19. To date the federal government has injected $27.9 billion in direct economic support into homes and businesses across the state, including in Cairns and Far North Queensland. This is more than three times the $8.8 billion spent by the Queensland Labor government, mainly on health initiatives, which is the lowest spend as a proportion of economic activity of any state in the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is absolutely no doubt that the federal government will need to continue to support Cairns and Port Douglas businesses in some capacity and in moving forward. I might add that in other communities, like Cooktown and in the Torres Strait, there is need for help as well. That's not because Annastacia Palaszczuk and Labor have demanded it but because the federal government value their local tourism industry, workers and families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To highlight the effects of snap border closures on our businesses and travel confidence, I would like to highlight the plight of tourism businesses in my electorate. Getaway Trekking and Adventures, owned and operated by Wayne and Sue Fitcher, is an adventure tourism business operating out of Far North Queensland and Victoria. Pre COVID they were largely inbound and travelling predominantly in Papua New Guinea. The pandemic stopped their business overnight. The owners were faced with three options: close their doors, resulting in 200 clients losing their deposits; hibernate until international borders open; or take the opportunity to adapt and reimagine their business as a domestic tourism operator. They chose the latter. The company was just about to embark on its first major trek from Melbourne to Penola but—you guessed it—the South Australian border to Victoria was slammed shut and then came a five-day Victoria lockdown. Just think about the flow-on effect these decisions have on this one business, its clients and its suppliers—and, of course, the list goes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Border closures should be a last resort and not the first option, as has been the case. Queensland's hardworking doctors, nurses, health professionals and contact tracers are the best in the world. There's no question about that. They're the ones that have kept us seriously safe. I have the utmost faith in their ability to continue to deal efficiently and effectively with any potential hotspots in the future, without the need to slam borders shut over one case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, for the figures that were just announced there—the 16-odd thousand—with the decision to shut the Victorian borders, I've already got so many reports, including the one from the Fitchers. People have cancelled their trips, and people are now reluctant to buy tickets to come up to our region because they're frightened they'll get stuck up there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, as I mentioned earlier, serious consideration needs to be given to support packages for those industries that will continue to face challenges due to the coronavirus pandemic. It would be a crying shame for us to have successfully overcome the health and economic challenges—and we will; there's no doubt about that—only to realise that we no longer have a tourism industry to showcase our natural beauty to the world. So I'd just say that it's absolutely critical for areas like Cairns and Port Douglas, and for other businesses that continue to be affected, particularly from these border closures, even though they try to make the changes. We need to continue the support.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265990" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  This government is not on the side of Australian families. Whether it's cutting wages, breaking promises, rorting community grants or making dishonest land deals, they continue to neglect everyday Australians. One area where this neglect is most stark is the growing waiting list for home-care packages. As of 27 October 2020, there were over 98,000 Australians waiting to be offered approval for their home-care package and more than 3,000 of these Australians are from the south-west of Sydney, where my electorate is based. Senior Australians in Werriwa have been waiting for years for their home-care packages. They now have to rely on the Commonwealth Home Support Program. The problem with the CHSP is that there is a lack of service providers to provide the services that are needed by older Australians. In Green Valley in my electorate, constituents don't even have access to services to mow their lawns, as there are no providers that provide that service in the district.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My office has received over 40 calls from senior Australians regarding My Aged Care recently. Complaints vary from unacceptably long waiting lists or no service providers to a lack of access for those who are from non-English-speaking backgrounds. With the complex and complicated processes to be navigated and the documentation required, many are more than likely to give up in frustration. The organisations that support older Australians from non-English-speaking backgrounds are provided with limited funding, as this government, as with most of its other policies, prefers a lazy, one-size-fits-all approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that aged care in Australia was in crisis long before COVID-19 applied more pressure. If older Australians are supported at home, there are significant savings to the nation—not to mention their quality of life and that of their family. Yet the government has also been failing senior Australians who choose to live at home. Over the last three years, more than 30,000 senior Australians have died waiting for a home-care package to be approved. Lives could be saved if this government had not neglected aged care. Despite the government's obsession with avoiding responsibility for anything, the fault sits fairly and squarely with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've reported to parliament on many occasions about the Liverpool City Council initiative of the children's parliament. Children from years 5 and 6 from schools in the 2168 postcode are elected by their peers to represent concerns they see in the local area. The issues raised through the lens of our children have included the environment, safety around the school and, more recently, issues about poverty they see with their friends. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Liverpool council recently surveyed children from the 11 representative schools. Six hundred and seventy-five responses were received. Over 40 per cent of children see poverty affecting other children's families. Forty-one per cent of students have witnessed someone in their school missing out on food because of poverty. Seventy-one per cent of the students said they could do better at school if they had proper devices and access to the internet. There is only so much young students can do when they experience so much hardship in their lives. Too many children are being left behind because they don't have the essentials and the resources to do well. An overwhelming number of students have noted cases of poverty and peers who don't have food at school, and that is too high and too unacceptable. Governments on all levels need to ensure that students across Australia experience a fair level of schooling and support, no matter what their circumstances, or I fear many students will fall through the cracks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another month, and there are still thousands of Australians stranded overseas—Australians who have been left overseas with no money and no prospect of coming home. Abandoned by their own government, Australians have had to dip into their bank accounts to survive in foreign countries and pay exorbitant prices for commercial flights home. Government assistance shouldn't be limited just to loans. The loans don't guarantee you a return ticket to Australia, and they push citizens further into debt. They also have to pay out of pocket for their hotel quarantine, although, if they're back on Australian soil, many people are more than willing to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is on the side of families. It's time we brought people home. Whether it's those in aged care, those waiting for home care, students who live in poverty or those overseas waiting to come home, Labor won't neglect them as this government has. Under Labor, no-one will be held back and no-one will be left behind.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="G86" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  Who amongst us here is good enough to have a movie made about their lives? Who can claim to be so charismatic that Naomi Watts would be happy to portray us? None, I am guessing. But such a person does exist on the Northern Beaches of Sydney—a person who has strength and determination, a person who is a passionate adventurer, a talented surfer and a dedicated mother of three. I speak, of course, of the great Sam Bloom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sam was born on 13 August 1971. Growing up on the Northern Beaches with her two siblings, she developed an affinity for the ocean at an early age. This love of the ocean inspired her first passion: surfing. Sam would meet her friends down at Bilgola Beach every afternoon after school in order to go surfing. She admits that she was the only girl surfing in a pack of boys, but I have no doubt that Sam had no trouble keeping up with her male counterparts. Sam was equally as passionate about travelling as she was about surfing. Her wanderlust was inspired by her parents, who took her and her brothers and sisters out of school for three months in order to travel across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sam shared both her love of the ocean and her thirst for adventure with her husband, Cameron, whom she met shortly after graduating high school. After 10 years together, they started their own family. Their first-born son, Rueben, was shortly followed by Noah and their last child, Oli. Desperate to share their love of travel with their children, Sam and Cam took their children on their first overseas holiday to Thailand. What was meant to be a picturesque beach holiday turned into anything but that. The family spent their first morning frolicking in the tropical waters before they retreated to the small hotel to embrace the view from the observation deck, which is when everything changed for the worse for this family. Sam leant on the balcony, craving a closer look at the beauty before her. The wood below her gave way, and her section of the balcony fell more than six metres onto the concrete below. Her sons and husband can recall the horrific scene. They looked down only to see Sam unconscious and badly injured. Life as the family knew it had changed. Sam had a severe spinal cord injury.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Understandably, Sam spent much time grieving the loss of her old life. Now a full-time wheelchair user, she had lost her independence and relied on her husband for even the smallest things. Her middle son found an injured baby magpie that had fallen out of her nest. Desperate to bring the black and white waddling magpie to safety, he brought Penguin home, and Sam nursed her back to health. Noah believes that the injured bird unified his family at a time when the Blooms needed it the most. Sam believed it was Penguin that gave her hope. As the bird's injuries began to heal, Sam began to heal, too. She started kayaking and was grateful to soon be accepted for the Australian paracanoe team. She travelled to Italy to compete in the world championships. Five years after that fateful day, Sam began to surf again, albeit lying down. To no-one's surprise, Sam was as determined and passionate as ever. She was soon selected to compete with the Australian adaptive surfing team in San Diego.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now a published author, Sam and her family have travelled a long way since that accident in 2013. I stand today proud to commend the lived bravery and strength of Sam Bloom and her family. We are so lucky to have such an inspiring individual and an incredible athlete within our community. I highly recommend seeing the movie as it is very worthwhile and it is a great Australian production.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I was honoured to be invited to the opening of St Sava College in Varroville last month with my colleague the member for Macarthur, the state member for Macquarie Fields and the member for Hughes. St Sava College will be an open, friendly and inclusive educational institution. The student body of the college will predominantly come from the Serbian community, who have a large presence in the south-west. However, it is anticipated that students will come from the Greek, Russian and Arabic Orthodox communities and the broader community in surrounding suburbs. The college is named after the patron saint Sava, who was a Serbian prince, the first Archbishop of the Serbian Church and widely considered to be the founder of Serbian medieval literature.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the idea of establishing an Orthodox college in Sydney was conceived in the early nineties, the project was postponed due to the war in the Balkans. After the purchase of the land in 2003 and the laying of the foundation stone by the Crown Prince of Yugoslavia in 2005, building approvals were finalised by Campbelltown City Council in 2007. It is due to the many years of hard work and the labour of love of volunteers and workers that the college is now open for K to year 2. I congratulate the Serbian Orthodox community and wish the college a fantastic inaugural year of schooling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a joy to celebrate Lunar New Year this weekend at the Mingyue Lay Buddhist Temple in Bonnyrigg. Mingyue Lay Temple is one of the most significant cultural buildings in south-west Sydney. It is also home to one of the largest Chinese Buddhist congregations in the Southern Hemisphere. Lunar New Year has been celebrated at Mingyue Lay Buddhist Temple for nearly 30 years. It has been my privilege to join the president and secretary, Vincent Kong and James Chan, on so many occasions to share the celebrations and milestones of this community. Lunar New Year celebrations are always special. This year, not only were the colours and movements of the daytime fireworks and lion dances COVID safe, but the rain did not dampen the spirits of the community. I'd like to commend all the volunteers that ensured that the temple held another great event this year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The temple also maintains a strong sense of community. Volunteers and staff conduct major fundraising activities for humanitarian causes such as floods and bushfires, and we as a community can't appreciate that more. When they heard about the loss of firefighters Geoffrey Keaton and Andrew O'Dwyer, from the Horsley Park Fire Brigade in 2019, they raised an amazing quarter of a million dollars for the bushfire brigade. This provided not only material support but also emotional support for those left behind.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  I want to congratulate three innovative and accomplished women in the Wentworth community who were successful in receiving a Boosting Female Founders Initiative grant recently. Members may know that the Boosting Female Founders Initiative program is designed to help female founders of start-up business scale their businesses to reach domestic and global markets and help them overcome some of the disadvantages in access to finance and support experienced by female founders. It is a $52.2 million program, and there were three recent recipients in my electorate of Wentworth, and I want to single them out here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Zara Lord, the founder and CEO of uPaged Pty Ltd, was a registered nurse who saw a gap in the market and helped create a platform where casual nurses could directly connect with employers, predominantly hospitals, to showcase their skills; uPaged focuses on having a disruptive impact on the health industry, cutting out the middleman placement agencies and giving nurses more autonomy over their workplace choices and hospitals better access to staff. On being awarded a Boosting Female Founders grant of $398,155, Zara has been able to accelerate the growth of her start-up business to a wider Australian healthcare market as well as undertake global expansion. The uPaged business model uses technology to advance employment practices, increasing employee wages and choices and lowering employer costs for healthcare organisations. With the assistance of the grant, expansion of such an innovative and transformational business has been particularly timely given the changes and challenges that the health industry has faced in the last year through COVID. Well done to Zara and the uPaged team. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also met with Kylie Legge, the CEO of Place Score. Place Score is a company which collects human-centric data to guide decisions on planning within cities and towns. The $186,000 Boosting Female Founders grant has helped Kylie's business create a nationally consistent online platform for measuring and tracking liveability in urban environments from a community perspective. The idea is that different levels of government and the private sector can use these insights to understand community values and be better informed when making investment and planning decisions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third recipient I met with is Cate Hull, the CEO and founder of Freight Exchange. Kate helped develop a digital market for freight, connecting carriers with shippers and enabling the efficient management of freight in one place, in particular removing some of the paperwork that currently bedevils freight practices. Cate was keen to expand the reach of Freight Exchange, and the $400,000 Boosting Female Founders grant has enabled Cate to launch her business in a multimodal and global way, including with sites in Hong Kong. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to Zara, Kylie and Cate on your vision, hard work and entrepreneurial skills. With these businesswomen's ongoing determination, and with the assistance of Australian government grants, these Australian founded businesses will continue to grow and in so doing create jobs and help contribute to the strengthening of the Australian economy. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (10<span class="HPS-Time">:36</span>):  The Morrison government's focus on announcement over delivery is putting at risk tens of thousands of jobs of workers in our travel and tourism industry and the small businesses that employ them. The travel industry, both domestic and international, has faced some of the harshest conditions throughout the last 12 months. I have recently met with a number of small business operators and staff from the travel and tourism industry in my electorate. Many of them have said that when JobKeeper ends and JobSeeker reverts back to its original rate these businesses simply will not be able to survive without further support. A recent survey of travel agents showed that just one in 10 businesses will survive beyond April without urgent targeted support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After months of pleading the travel agents got some assistance through the Consumer Travel Support Program, but, despite detailed feedback from the industry, the grants program has been so poorly designed that it's failing to deliver support for those it's supposed to help. Many travel businesses and travel agents are failing to qualify for that support because of the way they define their turnover in their business activity statement. Despite repeated warnings, the government launched a program that it knew would not work. But they still went ahead and did it. It's seeing agencies closed and jobs lost. Faced with the reality, the newly appointed minister continues to defend the program, which is expected to see many small and mid-sized agency collapse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has repeatedly called on the government to address this issue, highlighting the concerns raised by the sector, members of the peak body, and the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. The government must fix this bungled program before more agents are forced to close and more Australians lose their jobs. It's been clear for nearly a year that the broader tourism sector is not going to be able to snap back as the Prime Minister hopes it will. Labor has repeatedly called on the government to address issues, highlighting the huge challenge faced by the tourism and travel sector and the importance of these operators surviving. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently met with Patrick Barden, who runs This Is Africa. He used to employ 11 staff; he's now got five left. As he said, who's going to process the clients' refunds and bookings when there are no staff after March if these businesses have to close when JobKeeper ends? Peter Burke, who represents Travellers Autobarn, has been a tourism operator since 1993. His business has overcome the Ansett pilot strike, 9/11, SARS, swine flu and bird flu and the GFC, but he's now on the brink. He's pleading for the Morrison government to take responsibility and act. In his letter he says: 'Why would the government provide enough support to almost save the tourism industry? We have come this far. We've not profited from JobKeeper. We've worked exactly as the government hoped, but we're bleeding money. We need a lifeboat to stop the slow leak.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the view of the travel and tourism sector. The government must support our travel and tourism operators and the staff they employ. </span>

The City of Mitcham's Young Citizen of the Year is Tom Morrison, who has been a vocal advocate for our local environment. Tom's work commenced through his Facebook page, 20 Metre Trees, which he started in 2017 to raise awareness of important large trees within Adelaide.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Mitcham's Active Citizenship award went to the Big A Charity shop in Hawthorn. Selling fresh produce from their community garden and second-hand bargains for over 20 years, the shop provides a welcoming atmosphere for many in the community who regularly stop by for a coffee and a chat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along the coast, the City of Holdfast Bay's Young Citizen of the Year award went to Lori Chandler. A member of the Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club, Lori not only coaches athletes from ages five to 60; she has also worked hard to increase female retention at surf clubs. Through her effort she established the Girls at Seacliff committee within the club, which looks at ways to better engage with female members.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Holdfast Bay's Active Citizenship award this year went to Emma Sandery for her contributions to our local community. Emma established the Seacliff Community Produce Swap, where local residents can come together to swap excess home-grown produce. Emma has also created a 'Buy Nothing' Facebook group which encourages people to share, swap, give away or lend items for free to prevent them going to landfill.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Holdfast Bay's Community Event of the Year award went to Sarah Tinney for her Marilyn Jetty Swim. Participating in a bike and jetty classic for the seventh year, a group of adventurous women and some men dressed up from head to toe as Marilyn Monroe to raise money for the Cancer Council of South Australia. Over 300 Marilyns took the plunge for this year's classic, which took place earlier this month. They hoped to raise $100,000 this year, but Sarah and the Marilyns truly went above and beyond and blew that target out of the water; they have so far raised over $160,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the City of Marion, the Marion RSL Bowling Club took out the Sports Team of the Year award. The club was dominant throughout the 2019-20 season, with three of their teams winning pennants in the Metropolitan Bowls Association. Not only was this the most pennants won by any club; they did so while fielding just five teams—an incredible success rate. The winning teams were: Wednesday Division 4 South West; Saturday Division 6 South; and Saturday Division 7 South West.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to all of this year's Australia Day award winners. We thank you most sincerely for everything you do for our local community. It's volunteers like all of these outstanding local residents who make Boothby such a wonderful place to live.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  Last summer's unprecedented bushfires, our first national climate change disaster, were of course concentrated in Victoria and New South Wales. While there were significant fires in Western Australia, including blazes in Cape Arid and Stirling Range National Park, we were fortunate last summer that human communities in Western Australia were little affected. This summer we have not been that fortunate. There have been numerous fires that have threatened residential suburbs, including Cockburn in my electorate and the fire that raged through the Perth Hills a fortnight ago that was devastating for those communities. There were 86 homes destroyed as a result of an inferno that tore through 11,000 hectares. Power was cut to 600 residential and business premises. It is estimated that the damage bill will run to in excess of $40 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker Irons, as you will know, the response from fire and emergency services was incredible, and the conduct of community members in terms of following advice and supporting one another was crucial in facing that emergency. Since that time, the outpouring of support from the wider Perth community, especially through the Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund, has shown exactly the kind of solidarity and generosity of spirit that we rightly value as part of our character in WA and in Australia more broadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to acknowledge the 500 professional and volunteer firefighters and the SES volunteers, without whose work we may well have seen loss of life, and we certainly would have seen much greater loss of homes and natural habitat. I know that volunteer firefighters from my electorate, coordinated through the Jandakot and South Coogee bushfire brigades, put in some 800 hours of work in hot, blustery, scary, exhausting conditions over the course of 12 days. I say thank you to all those people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad these efforts ensured that the fire didn't affect two critical sanctuaries—Karakamia and Paruna—that are operated by the Australian Wildlife Conservancy, in the Perth Hills. Our biodiversity is in such a bad state that we really can't afford to see these vitally protective enclosures harmed. It should be a reminder that the climate change disaster we saw last year in eastern Australia resulted in the scorching of 12 million hectares and the loss of three billion Australian animals. When we already have so many species close to extinction, these fire events can push endangered animals close to the brink. It's bewildering that in these circumstances the government has no interest in acting to address Australia's failed environmental protection framework. Instead it seeks to maintain the status quo, a weak and ineffective set of national standards and no monitoring and compliance agency to enforce them. That's despite the clear recommendations by Dr Graeme Samuel, who was appointed by the government to lead reform of the EPBC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fires in WA, which coincided with the COVID-19 lockdown, have made it a very difficult start to 2021 for the communities that we all represent. But Western Australians have faced those challenges by living up to our values, by showing great resilience and forbearance, by supporting and caring for one another and by facing dark days together with as much energy and laconic good humour as possible.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  It's my pleasure to update the House on an exciting project that's taking place in Grassy Harbour on King Island. Thanks to a collaboration between the Morrison government, Wave Swell Energy Limited, motivated investors, the King Island Council and dozens of local businesses across Tasmania, about 1,000 tonnes of cutting-edge wave energy technology is currently being deployed and tested. Funding through the Morrison government's Australian Renewable Energy Agency provides this crucial data from the $4 million investment which is set to inform us about the potential of wave energy and how it becomes a significant contributor to global needs for clean, emission-free electricity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The trial at Grassy Harbour works like an artificial blowhole. There's a big underwater chamber that's open at the front, and as water passes into the open chamber it forces a turbine and consequently generates electricity—clean, green, renewable electricity. Research estimates that wave technology energy has the potential to contribute up to 11 per cent of the nation's energy by 2050. That's equivalent to the energy needs of the city of Melbourne. Once operational next month, this trial could potentially make King Island a global leader, with power generation that operates from three different types of renewable energy: wind, solar and wave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is incredibly exciting for me, for King Island and for Tasmania more broadly. It was only a couple of months ago that we reached our target of being 100 per cent powered by renewable energy in Tasmania. We've reached this benchmark two years ahead of schedule, and this project will play an important part in moving Tasmania forward towards its 200 per cent renewable generation goal by 2040. The eyes of the world will be watching closely, and rightly so. Tasmania is way out in front when it comes to emission reduction and playing its part in the development of new, practical technologies that will reduce emissions globally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, projects such as this could not happen without the support of our great businesses. Our small businesses, our manufacturers and in this case over 20 local businesses based in the north-west of Tasmania were contributors to the project. I know that Wave Swell Energy has sung the praises of everyone involved, the quality of the workmanship, the enthusiasm for the project and their genuine desire to get the job done during what has been an incredibly trying past 12 months. Projects like these have flow-on benefits, with flights, accommodation, vehicle purchase and hire, general supplies and retail purchases further boosting our economy and our region. I'll be on King Island early next month and am looking forward to seeing the project, climbing onboard and seeing how it's generating clean, green, renewable energy for the great island of King Island.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  The royal commission into aged care will be completed and delivered at the end of this month. The recommendations are vital to fixing the flaws—indeed, fault lines—in aged care in Australia. This government has failed senior Australians. This government has failed the families of senior Australians who rely on and want to be able to trust that their loved ones are being properly cared for. This government has failed workers in aged care. The coalition has had the past eight years to reform aged care and has missed the mark at every single opportunity. I, like many Australians, am, frankly, outraged and disgusted by the failures of this government and its dereliction of our aged-care sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why today I want to tell you a story about Judy, who contacted my office last year after the tragic loss of her mum. Judy's story has hit me professionally but personally too. Judy's mother, Joan, tragically passed away well before her time, presenting to hospital from an aged-care facility with pressure wounds, dehydration and malnutrition. She had widespread body wounds that had developed into narcotising fasciitis; gas gangrene, which is just putrid; and septic shock. This tragedy around Joan's death has been medically substantiated and well documented. It is not just family hearsay. To say Joan's pathology at the time of hospital admission was alarming is truly an understatement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the trauma of losing her mother, Judy committed to advocating for the system to be better, to make Joan's passing something that would change things for the better. She wrote to the minister and submitted many questions to the commission. She pleaded for answers at the time. The minister's office promised her that the commission would answer all of her questions. Despite many questions being asked, the appropriate answers were never given. I am disgusted that this coalition government would deem this okay. Where is this okay? When is this ever okay? Every day we are losing senior Australians, like Joan, to a failing system that is underfunded and, quite frankly, under-regulated, not to mention understaffed. I implore those opposite to consider the loss of life we have seen in just the past year across this sector. The aged-care minister may not know the figures but he should know the consequences. This government must fix aged care in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  It's my melancholy duty to inform the chamber about the decision recently by the Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation, which rubberstamped the previous decision of them, which has cut at the heart of the horticultural industry in Australia and New Zealand. Their decision will now allow fruit juices, and for that matter vegetable juices, to be rated as low as two health stars based purely on their sugar content, ranking them lower—lower!—than many diet soft drinks. Industry proposed a sensible middle ground solution, four health stars for 100 per cent Australian and New Zealand made fruit juice with no added sugar, but that was rejected. I congratulate Mr Littleproud on the campaign but, unfortunately, we haven't seen success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's most disappointing from the decision of states and territories like Queensland, the Northern Territory, the ACT, Victoria—and, of course, Jacinda Ardern's New Zealand—is that these governments have betrayed Australian and New Zealand farmers and they've let down people who rely on these health star ratings. The low health star rating for juice blatantly contradicts the Australian Dietary Guidelines, which place fresh fruit in the 'eat more' category. These guidelines allow for juice to substitute for free—125 millilitres of fruit juice equates to a serving of fruit. It's almost inconceivable that despite the many benefits of fruit juice all-natural Australian fruit juice will attract a rating below 2½ stars. At a time when only five per cent of Australians get their daily recommended intake of fruit and vegetables, regulators such as the Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation have a moral responsibility to encourage the consumption of fruit and vegetables.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this change, I feel confident that we'll see less Australian 100 per cent grown fruit juice in trolleys. That's the last thing we need around the country. It's the last thing consumers need and it's absolutely the last thing Australian producers need. The Australian citrus producers in my electorate turn out some of the best product in the world, and to think that an orange juice without any sugar added to it would be deemed less healthy than Diet Coke—Mr Deputy Speaker, I'm sorry for the unparliamentary language—is batshit stupid. My call-out to Australians who are listening to this is: do me a favour, support these producers, next time you're at the supermarket put some 100 per cent Australian fruit juice in your trolley and tell the regulator to get stuffed!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  [by video link] At our Australia Day citizenship ceremony this year, it was an honour to be present when Mr Charlie Grech was named Hume City Council Senior Citizen of the Year. Charlie was unfortunately unable to attend in person to accept the award because he was in hospital and seriously ill. His son, Dr Charles Grech accepted the award on his behalf. Sadly, Charlie passed away last Wednesday, and I want to say some things today about Charlie's 40-year service to our local community. Charlie's community mindedness and his desire to make a difference led him to serve nine years as a councillor with the former City of Broadmeadows. His passionate advocacy for local issues saw him play an integral part in shaping some of the more significant and enduring community projects, including the Broadmeadows Hospital, the Rotary Park at Johnstone Street and the establishment of Northern Brite Industries, which today continues to provide excellent service and care to people with disabilities and their families in our community. As a long-time resident of our community, Charlie, since 1978, held a number of posts and responsibilities. He served as president and secretary of the Greenvale Residents Association, where he spent over 20 years as an active member and an office holder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Charlie and I first met when, as the newly elected member for Calwell, Charlie wrote to me demanding action on the long-promised state government plan to build a secondary school college in Greenvale. His energy and determination was aided by his very deep knowledge of how things worked, as he would always say to me, because, when it came to engaging local members of parliament, I was always put on notice that this was a man to be reckoned with. His energy was abounding and, when I was first invited to attend a Greenvale Residents Association meeting all those years ago to hear residents' demands for the school to be built, Charlie introduced me and began reading from my maiden speech, where I spoke of the transforming power of public schools. Charlie always did his homework. The decades-long community campaign for a secondary school in Greenvale, which Charlie was integral to, was finally given the go-ahead by the state government in 2020 and is due to open in 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Charlie continued to advocate for the residents of Greenvale, always willing to take action when needed. He lobbied VicRoads for improvements to dangerous roads and intersections and the installation of traffic lights, and never gave up until the job was done. In addition, Charlie spent many years as president, treasurer and committee member of the Rotary Club of Broadmeadows. Charlie loved his community. He cared for it and he fought for it. I was saddened to hear of his illness and rapid decline. I'm saddened by his death. It is a great loss to our community. Charlie belonged to a generation of Australians who gave their time willingly to the betterment of their community. His voluntary work was commendable— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  I am passionate about ensuring Western Sydney is at the heart of the new era in manufacturing. That's why last week I was proud to join the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction to take a tour of a great Aussie manufacturer in Lindsay, in St Mary's. Custom Denning are pioneers in the next generation of technology and they are great entrepreneurs, doing it for themselves. They're taking risks, they're investing themselves and they are succeeding. Grant and Scott showcase their range of electric buses and the new technology that they are developing, and, like all great Australian manufacturers, they're delivering a higher quality and better product than their foreign competitors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister and I then joined a great Aussie business, the Australian Arms Hotel, which is down the road from my office, on High Street in Penrith. It is a fantastic local pub. We announced the Morrison government's $10.2 million investment into the Hotel Energy Uplift Program. This program will help small and medium sized hotels, motels and serviced departments, like the Australian Arms as well as others right across the country, to access grants of up to $25,000. These grants can go towards things like upgrading their air conditioning, refrigeration, windows, insulation, and more, for energy efficiency. By helping them become more energy efficient, we are also helping them drive down their own electricity bills. This program will also help support more local jobs, with electricians, carpenters, engineers and plumbers all ready to help businesses with their installation. Business people in Lindsay know how important it is to deliver affordable, reliable energy and to create more local jobs. We know that local hotels have been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus pandemic, so I was pleased to hear from Luke that people are coming back into the pub, locals are coming back to work and business is improving. Delivering lasting energy savings for these businesses will help them get back to doing what they do best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also hosted a forum with the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction. That was an opportunity to hear from local businesses about how they're going through the coronavirus pandemic, to give feedback on energy and for us to have some really good discussions. I was really pleased to hear from the manufacturers in the room about how our manufacturing strategy as well as our energy policies are supporting their local businesses. I want to thank everyone in my community of Lindsay who came out and supported the minister's visit, and I look forward to seeing you all back in Lindsay when I get home soon.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important motion that relates to travel agents and the significant role that they play in our tourism industry. They sustain businesses; they employ thousands of people across the country. Many are just mum and dad small businesses in neighbourhoods. We know that tourism was immediately one of the hardest hit industries once the coronavirus hit Australia. For many travel agents, around 40,000 across Australia, the cost of staying open in order to refund and rearrange travel arrangements for people who were forced to cancel holidays—you can imagine not earning any money, but still having to keep your doors open to pay back fares and to rearrange the many travel arrangements that had been made. They have been working tirelessly for zero money for the last 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the majority of the profit made in travel agencies is through international travel, and they have really been suffering. International travel restrictions will likely remain in place for a number of years in the future. Travel agents need urgent assistance. We need the government to develop a comprehensive industry-specific support package for the tourism industry that actually works for the travel agents and acknowledges the important contribution that they make. An urgent lifeline is needed for travel agents who are on the brink of collapse. The travel agents I talk to in my electorate are all on the brink of collapse. We know a scheme has been purpose-built for travel agents, but we need a scheme that actually works—not the inadequate loss carry-back scheme for which the vast majority of travel agents appear to be ineligible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was recently contacted by Tashi Lachman who, together with her husband, owns and runs Thor World Travel, a long-established travel agency in my electorate, in Frome Road in Adelaide. It has been running since 1988. Tashi is absolutely desperate because she's got no idea how to keep her business open through 2021. She relayed to me that the announcement of $128 million in grants to the sector was incredibly welcome, but the application process is a shambles. It's too confusing and has resulted in many travel agents missing out on the grants they could have been eligible for. The instruction from the Australian trade and investment group was to apply based on the business's Australian GST revenue. As a result, Tashi was eligible for only $4,000. But this does not reflect the actual losses travel agents have faced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tashi has tried to reapply using her adjusted business activity statements, but Services Australia is unable to assist unless the ATO provides a new certificate. She then goes back to the ATO. The ATO say they can't do this unless Services Australia send them a request. The reality is that, because of the confusing instructions, Thor World Travel may miss out on the $20,000 it was likely to be eligible for. What a ridiculous catch 22. It's not as if travel agents didn't have enough to worry about; now they have to worry about the botch up of this particular grant. There are countless travel agents in my electorate and around Australia in the same position. This is typical of the government—big on announcements but very poor when it comes to detail and implementation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been calling for a targeted, sustainable support package for travel agents for a long time, because travel agents like Tashi and her husband are still struggling and are facing 12 months of uncertainty, if not longer. They've managed to keep their doors open and keep their staff, thanks to JobKeeper, but they're now concerned that JobKeeper may end, and that will absolutely ensure they will not be able to operate. Since the announcement that international borders are unlikely to open before 2022, even more of Tashi's clients have decided to ask for refunds for trips booked for the coming year. This hurts the business even more. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many travel agents across the country, Tashi and her husband are facing a very uncertain future, and it's heartbreaking. They started their business in 1988 when they migrated to Australia. They're proud small-business owners and they consider themselves fortunate to have always been able to work and support their family. They've never been a burden on the system. They've trained the hundreds of employees they have employed over the last 30 years. These are good small-business people. She wants her business to survive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The travel agent industry is a very important industry for Australia. We will need travel agents and the tourism industry to emerge from this economic crisis. Surely we can do better by people like Tashi and other travel agents who have given so much to our nation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  Every single electorate across this country has travel agents who go about their business every day and try to help Australians realise their ambitions and their dreams. There are of course many Australians who dream about owning their own home. There are Australians who want to retire with dignity. But people also want and dream about the opportunity to travel overseas as part of the choices they have in their life, and travel agents are a part of fulfilling that. But, of course, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, many travel agents have been brought to the precipice because of the simple fact that when we have international border closures it is almost impossible for anybody to book with confidence or to be able to make decisions about where they're going to be in only a few short months. To take myself as a classic example of this, I had booked a trip to Queensland at the end of this month, but the lockdown in Victoria has seen the end of that. Then there are the people who wanted to go overseas throughout all of last year, as well as those who are returning home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government understand why it has been so critical to support travel agents throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We've provided assistance and support through the JobKeeper scheme, which has been enjoyed by many businesses, but we also understood the specific need for targeted measures to support the travel agent sector. We have $128 million from the COVID-19 Consumer Travel Support Program, announced on 1 December 2020, that provides one-off grants for up to $100,000 to help travel agents continue to operate and process refunds for consumers. Those refunds have been a big burden on the travel agent sector. It is one of the reasons why, when we had the head of the ACCC, Rod Sims, before the House Standing Committee on Economics in October last year, we got him to formally state publicly that travel agents are entitled to take a share of the booking as part of a cancellation fee, so that every travel agent understands that they have choices and that they have options while protecting consumers, particularly in terms of the challenges they face with their cash flow. But that doesn't negate the fact that, because international borders continue to remain closed, travel agents need support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 16 September last year, I met with the Australian Federation of Travel Agents as well as many travel agencies within the Goldstein electorate. We are an electorate that has a lot of retirees, who use part of their retirement planning to plan to travel overseas and see the world in a way that they may not have been able to do during their working life, as part of their choice in their retirement. The travel agencies were clear about the impact they were continuing to experience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of these businesses have been built up over decades. There are small businesses in the Goldstein electorate—and I'm sure in many members' electorates—where there are skills and expertise that has been built up over decades to build travel agencies which the communities are rightfully proud of. There is the point of trust and credibility. Yes, we can all get information on the internet, but it's about the integrity, trust and reliability, and the personal experience and skill set in understanding what happens in different locations—making sure that customers have a full range of options, insurance and protection—that travel agencies embody. That's why they're so critical. It's also because they employ a very large number of older workers in the latter stages of their career—particularly women. Often, they have particular expertise from their own travel and experience to be able to guide customers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Morrison government has provided so much support through the Consumer Travel Support Program, to make sure that we have the back of travel agents through JobKeeper. We know that there are specific measures and support needed for the travel sector. That's because it's only travel agencies which have those skills within them which consumers rely on, which we want to have at the end of this pandemic, so that Australians who need to travel overseas can access the support services they need. The good thing is that $60 million has already been provided and paid for under this program. As of 1 February this year, 1,541 travel agents have received payments and another 1,003 payments are being processed right now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So if you're in the travel agent sector, we know you're doing it tough. We know you need support and assistance, and that's why we've provided it. The Morrison government understands the challenges faced by small business. The people in this place are doing everything they can to support them in these difficult times.</span>

                  <a href="00ATG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  I am speaking on this motion to support travel agents because it's time for Scott Morrison to wake up—to wake up to the fact that travel agents are doing it hard. I, like every federal member of parliament, am getting inundated by calls from travel agents, travel agencies and tour operators, especially, but not only, from those who deal in international travel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">JobKeeper, which the Morrison government introduced for travel agents, is a good thing. I'm not here to have a Liberal versus Labor tit-for-tat. But come 31 March there will be a crisis. The iceberg is going to hit the travel agency industry and tens of thousands of agents, predominantly women and predominantly small businesses, are about to hit that iceberg, and the travel scheme that the government announced with much fanfare isn't working the way it should. It's red tape and it's too long and, because of the different accounting standards used within the travel agent industry, some people are getting decent support but a lot of others are missing out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I want to do in parliament when I speak to Mr Morrison on behalf of travel agents is to use not my voice but the voices of the travel agents. I was just on the phone to a lovely travel agent before coming up here. She was in tears today because she has to retrench two of her six staff. She employs women, and this is a business which has been going for 17 years. She said: 'I don't understand why it's so cruel. I have to lay them off now as my director's duty, because I don't know if JobKeeper is going to continue.' How is it that we can be so cruel to our travel agents? If the government is going to continue JobKeeper after 31 March then just tell people! Just tell people now. And if they're not going to then they need to wake up to themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The travel agents I speak to have recovered billions of dollars for their customers and their clients. That's right—billions of dollars. Since March and February of last year, when COVID hit and the international borders slammed shut, Australians had billions of dollars of holiday bookings. And it hasn't been the government chasing the money, it hasn't been the sheriff's office chasing the money and it hasn't been Mr Morrison chasing the money for the customers; it's been travel agents. What is particularly cruel is that when they get the money back they of course have to refund their commissions in many cases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have today, right now, is 40,000 people on the phones in their lounge rooms, because their landlords wouldn't extend their rent. They have had to give up their super and they've had to negotiate all sorts of difficult payments, and every day they are chasing refunds for clients. So whilst travel has stopped, the travel agency industry hasn't stopped. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes in politics, it's not a matter of left or right, Labor or Liberal. Sometimes it's just a matter of right and wrong. What's happening to travel agents is wrong. I don't understand why the government can't see what needs to be done here. Until international borders are opened again, travel agents should get JobKeeper, in my opinion. Until we don't have states slamming up the borders, we need to have JobKeeper. We need a travel scheme which actually reflects that there are four different ways that the accounting industry calculate total turnover in the travel agency industry, which is the sweet spot for getting some government support. I just say to the government: this is not a matter of who's right and of opposition or government; this is a matter of travel agents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give you some words from people. One lady has written: 'We have had volcanos to deal with and we've had tsunamis. We have no complaints. But this is an issue which now the government needs to help us on.' Another lady has written to me and said: 'Since international border closures, I have been working at least 30 hours a week, seven days a week handling cancellations and trying to obtain refunds. I have utilised all my superannuation to survive and loans which have to be repaid to family and friends. I need JobKeeper to continue.' A travel agent said: 'I attended a Fight Cancer Foundation charity lunch the other day. It's normally held in December. Eighty travel agents attended the lunch. You can cut the anxiety with a knife.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The travel agents industry and tour operators feel deserted and let down by their government. They feel they have been thrown on the garbage heap. They feel that perhaps the government thinks it can go online or that travel agents are a thing of the past. We're not going to have overseas travel recovery until we back our travel agents. Please wake up Mr Morrison, and save our travel agents. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (11<span class="HPS-Time">:16</span>):  I thank the member for Adelaide for putting this motion on. I have been speaking with the travel agents across my electorate and indeed across Australia for the past six months. The last speaker is quite correct. This has to be a bipartisan approach. I have stood in this Federation Chamber and on the floor of the House and I have called for the government to make an industry-specific package. We worked together to get the $128 million that is currently being fed out to those needy recipients through the travel agents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some 40,000 people in this industry. Eighty per cent are women. They are mum and dad businesses, sometimes generational businesses. Sixty per cent of those small family businesses are in regional and rural Australia. We have an obligation to ensure their longevity after this year. The borders will not open this year; it is quite clear there will not be international travel. These businesses rely on between 90 and 95 per cent international travel. They are unable to make an income from their current profession. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been speaking with Darren Rudd, the CEO of AFTA, in relation to the $128 million and also the potential for an ongoing 'travelkeeper', in line with JobKeeper, for this industry. We can see that most industries have come off JobKeeper because they no longer need it. They have recovered sufficiently and they are back on their feet. They are able to make money and pay their employees. It was a great government initiative. It kept us economically financial and kept a lot of people in work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see now is that the travel industry is one of a handful of industries who require that ongoing support. We do need to approach it on a bipartisan basis. We can't say 'us and them'. We need to work together to ensure that that happens. What you've seen over the past 12 months is an industry that has continued to effectively work for free. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The borders were closed for the right reasons. The borders were closed for the health of our nation. Everybody agrees that it had to happen. When those borders closed, the travel agent industry was the first to be hit, and they would be the last to come out of it. But they didn't just stop work and apply for JobKeeper. They continued to work with $10 billion of booking fees over 12 months, to ensure that that $10 billion was returned to the citizens of Australia. At last glance they had returned I think around $7 billion to $8 billion worth of those travel fees. And not only did they not get paid, but the ACCC made a ruling that the commissions for the work they had previously done had to be repaid, so they were out of pocket for that work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But did they complain? No. They continued to do the heavy lifting for that industry to ensure that that money was returned to its rightful owners. They also continued to do the heavy lifting in getting our own citizens back into the country. So, we owe them a debt of gratitude for the work they have continued to do. And we owe them the opportunity to maintain their living, maintain their profession so that it will be there in 12 or 18 months time and so that they aren't on the edge of the cliff. I've spoken to literally hundreds of travel agents around the country, who tell me that they are facing bankruptcy, that they are having to hand back cars they have leased. They are facing an incredibly difficult time, but they are also appreciative of this government for the $128 million. They are appreciative of this government for the JobKeeper payment that was provided. And now they're asking this government to provide to them an industry-specific—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was in Cairns last week as part of the federal opposition's jobs task force, I met with a number of businesses, and the Leader of the Opposition heard firsthand about exactly what is happening in regional and Far North Queensland. We heard over and over again that people are reliant on tourists, particularly international travellers, for their survival. So, this makes it an issue of federal concern. I don't want any more speeches in this chamber about how hard the industry has worked. I don't want any more cheap words in this chamber about what the government could be doing, what the government should be doing. We know what the industry has asked for. The postcode of Cairns has the highest amount of JobKeeper of any postcode in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not rocket science. The minister was there the same day I was in Cairns, and what did he come and do? He offered absolutely nothing: nothing to the tourist operators, nothing to the hospitality industry. One vendor told us in January last year that they had 530 guests going out to sea on the reef that day. At the same time this year it was 27 guests. Then we have all the nonsense from the government saying: 'It's something to do with the Queensland borders. It's something to do with Annastacia Palaszczuk. It's something to do with Gladys Berejiklian.' What rot. Seventy per cent of the tourist dollars come from overseas in Cairns, and this government tries to have a fig leaf and say, 'It's something to do with border closures.' It is nonsense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of ignoring the tourist operators, the businesses are crying out for help. The JobKeeper repeal, which this government has committed to by the end of March, will see the industry drop off a cliff. More than 250,000 people in Queensland alone are still counting on it for survival. The government says on one hand the economy is recovering well, 'building back' or whatever is the latest marketing slogan the Prime Minister is on about. In reality it's working from the same old playbook, looking after itself this time by using businesses in metropolitan areas that are doing well as an excuse to rip money away from regional businesses, whose revenue is still down and who may never recover without ongoing subsidies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So today I call on the government. I want clear answers about what's replacing JobKeeper for the struggling tourism sector in Queensland at the end of March. We need an industry-specific support package. Talk to the tourism operators; they'll tell you exactly what they need. If you don't have a plan, continue JobKeeper. Protect jobs, invest in skills, look after the national asset that is our tourism industry, built up through so many decades. Our economy in Queensland relies on JobKeeper—the tourism sector right up and down the coast, from Cairns to the Whitsundays to Hervey Bay, right down to the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast. This shouldn't be a debate we're having in this parliament. This government should be looking after the tourism industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talk is cheap. Today I call on the Morrison government to do the right thing and support JobKeeper for tourism in Queensland. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  Thank you to my colleague the member for Adelaide for raising this issue. We've all heard so many times about the effect COVID has had on our economy. Unemployment soared through 2020, and service industries ground to a halt. The government had to mobilise, and through schemes like JobKeeper and JobSeeker we were able to shift rapidly and keep most people's heads above water. Almost a year on, we're finally seeing the effect these reforms had. After just a few months, growth is bouncing back, unemployment has turned the corner and, notwithstanding the handful of quick lockdowns like we're seeing in Victoria right now, life seems to be returning to a form of normal—a new normal. Economic data released recently shows the economy rebounding across most sectors. Shopping is back up to where it was, as are hospitality visits and other sectors. But one sector remains in the doldrums: the travel industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it stands to reason: borders are closed for our safety, and the lack of international travel has been one of the things that kept Australia as one of the healthiest in the world last year, but the follow-on effects are pretty grim for the travel industry. Bennelong has several travel agents, and I've spoken to many of them in recent months. It is clear that 2020 has been the toughest year that they have ever faced. I've heard stories of the pain of individuals working in the industry, uncertain about how long they may have a job. I have heard from small-business owners expressing their frustration and concerns for their staff. I've heard from businesses down the line who support the travel industry in various ways and have seen their biggest customers dry up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many have pointed out one of the unique paradoxes of the travel industry: while airlines are huge companies, many with international or government backing, over 70 per cent of travel agents are small businesses and franchises. They don't have the capacity to absorb shocks, so the crisis has gone to the heart of their small family businesses. This pain has travelled down through the industry to its customers, and plenty have felt the pain in their hip pockets over the holidays which have been planned and then cancelled. Many of these people have lost large amounts of money and received huge inconveniences that we must find ways to address. However, their particular plight is not the matter at hand here. Frankly, it deserves a debate all of its own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, the government has brought in specific reforms to address the unique concerns felt by the travel industry. At the beginning of December the government announced the COVID-19 Consumer Travel Support Program. This $128 million set of grants allows travel agents to claim between $1,500 and $100,000 to ensure they continue to operate. Nearly half of this allocation has already been spent, but I would encourage any travel agent in trouble to look at this scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additional to these bandaid solutions, we're also investing in our regional tourism offerings to encourage people who would otherwise be going overseas to travel domestically. Millions of dollars have gone to Tourism Australia, national parks, the Recovery for Regional Tourism Fund and, of course, support for the airlines. Together this will help domestic tourism get back on its feet, which will in turn provide the demand that travel agents need to survive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is clear that, while there are huge amounts of pain in the industry, the government is moving to help those who are needing it and has recognised the unequal nature of the economic recovery. I'm confident that we will retain this flexible approach through the coming year so that we can adapt to any further systemic shocks that this chaotic and adaptive virus may bring. Most importantly, I look forward to a time in the near future when we can all get vaccinated and get back to travelling as we did before 2020. While support grants will keep businesses above water, nothing will be as good as businesses working as they are designed to do and getting us back out to see the world—and getting the world to come and see us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the motion moved by the member for Adelaide. The government's mantra that Australia has not been hit as hard as most other countries by COVID-19 and that we're doing so well in comparison with most other countries is no comfort at all to the tens of thousands of people whose lives have been left in turmoil by COVID-19 here in Australia—people who have lost lifelong jobs, who have now got no income, who have lost their savings and even their superannuation, and who have little prospect of getting a job in the future because of either their age or their lifelong experience in one industry alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no sector that has been hit harder with respect to all of this than the travel sector. With no warning and no foresight, they've had the rug pulled from under them. Their businesses have literally vanished. There are some 40,000 people who work in the travel industry today, and over 70 per cent of them are women. There are about 4,000 travel agents throughout the country, and most are in small family owned enterprises that have often taken out loans to set up their businesses, that have been operating pretty much on a shoestring budget and that now find themselves with no income and no prospect of their business reviving in the near future. They'll also find themselves, unlike most other businesses and as others have already said, actually refunding money from previous years' earnings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even worse, given what the government has already done in terms of support—I'm talking about JobKeeper, JobSeeker and the $128 million assistance package—the reality is that there is also some discrimination in terms of the way they get all of that support. It's discrimination that is brought about because of Australia's tax laws and the way that the government has structured the support packages, including JobSeeker. I have spoken to some travel agents in my part of Adelaide who are all struggling to get those benefits simply because of the way they manage their operations; indeed, one of those people, Connie Dziwoki, who I spoke about in this place only a few weeks ago and who I know has since written to several government ministers about her dilemma, makes that absolutely clear. It's to do with the way they report their income for the purpose of their business activity statements. Business activity statements can be reported in different ways and the same outcome results in terms of the tax that they are obliged to pay. How these people report, however, determines the level of assistance that is given to them from the government's $128 million package. It turns out that two identical operators, literally working in the same area in the same kind of travel agent business, can receive a vastly different amount of support. It's different almost to the point of 10 to one. In this particular person's case—she operates Genesis Travel and Cruise—the amount she has actually been offered as part of the assistance package is just over one-tenth of that offered to a similar business, simply because of the reporting nature.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has the government's response been to all of that? 'We will not allow you to change or amend your funding application,' because, of course, that means they would have to pay out a lot more money—I'd imagine that's the real reason behind it. When they realised that there was an anomaly in the reporting method they put on a cut-off date of 4 January, saying that after that you cannot amend your application and therefore you will only be entitled to the amount based on the figures you originally supplied, not the figures that would otherwise have, quite rightly, entitled you to the higher amount. That is simply absurd and simply unfair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One in 10 travel agents are likely not to survive if the government does not extend the JobKeeper program. If that happens, we will not only lose years and years of expertise but, quite frankly, we'll leave the whole travel agent sector decimated. In years to come when, hopefully, things do rebound we will not have the people there to give travellers the support that they've been getting for years and which they will depend on in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to extend JobKeeper, it needs to have an industry-specific support program and it needs to allow amendments to the application process. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="56430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  I want to commend Mr Georganas for putting this motion on the tourism industry before the House. It is certainly timely. This is a genuine industry that has effectively come to fore of the government's understanding. The government understands that it does have specific needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I had the opportunity to host around 10 travel agents in my electorate office. I heard firsthand how they have effectively had to work for the last 12 months whilst international travel, where they make all their money—they make very little money from domestic traffic—shut. They have had to continue working because around $4 billion of Australians' money was stuck somewhere—maybe in an airline's account, or some overseas travel agent's or tour operator's account or in some accommodation house's account. All this money has, effectively, had to be reprocessed back, either to be refunds or in the form of credits. This has been through the tireless work of these travel agents, effectively working for nothing. They are very grateful for the support of JobKeeper; in fact, JobKeeper is keeping them in business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">JobKeeper is fine for their wages but they're also going to need additional help in relation to paying their utilities and their other ongoing expenses. That's why, in fact, the government put $128 million on the table to assist. Yes, as a previous speaker said, there was a large cohort of these travel agents who put in conflicting amounts for their turnover, GST or commissions. Those who put their total turnover in were compensated in what I would say was the right amount, but those other two categories have been left out. The government is moving to assist those travel agents because the government understands that this is a critical industry and that if we don't offer them the assistance that they need then they will go to the wall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This industry needs to be commended. The main issue of the travel agents I spoke to—their sole issue—is to look after their clients, to make sure that more of that $4 billion that is still sitting overseas somewhere, or is sitting with an Australian airline company, or is in the form of credits or potential refund money, does in fact find its way back. If these tour operators, travel agents, effectively go out of business because we can't get the right assistance to them, then we're going to have a whole cohort of Australians who are not going to be able to be quite sure who it is that's going to help them get their refund or get their credits lined up for when we go into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an amazing industry. There's a wealth of knowledge tied up in this industry. These people love their work. They love their work, primarily because they make so many Australians very, very happy with being able to organise their tours and organise their holidays. It is an industry where you're finding that they are put into a very, very difficult situation now. They get their commissions at the time of the holiday but the bookings are made many months in advance, so they find themselves in a very difficult position. They do need additional assistance. I'm sure we are looking forward to announcements into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, getting this $60-odd million, that's still outstanding, from the rescue package that was put in place by the government. The first thing we need to do is get that sorted out so that our travel agents can, in fact, get the money that the government intends them to receive. Then we need to look at how we're going to continue that support so that this particular industry, the travel agency sector, can maintain its workload into the future so that it can keep supporting all of those Australians who have so much money, right at the moment, tied up in an account somewhere for a holiday that they're yet to have.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a young dad there is nothing more important to me than protecting my kids and I know it's the same for every parent in the Ryan electorate. Child sexual abuse is a very real threat in Australia. It is a scourge that we must not shy away from and we must tackle head-on and with courage. It's highly confronting. The things that we hear in this space are terrible crimes that you can barely manage to hear or to consider, but we can't stay silent on this issue. That is what the predators count on. I have said it before in this place: these predators count on us turning down the TV or turning the page of the newspaper when we hear or see the horrors of these stories. We can't do that. We must talk about these issues. We must talk, importantly, about its prevalence in our community, so that parents know the risk—they must talk about it with their kids—so that we can work together as a community to prevent it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's for this reason that I rise and move this motion today on the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation, known as the ACCCE. I want to start by acknowledging the Minister for Home Affairs, Minister Dutton, for being the driving force behind the establishment of the ACCCE and for his unwavering commitment to find, stop and prosecute these sickening offenders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to an increasing number and severity of reports of child exploitation received by Australian law enforcement agencies, in 2018 the Morrison government, with a $68.6 million commitment, established the ACCCE. For those not familiar with it, it is led by the AFP and brings together skills across public and private sectors, all working together in one central hub, to protect our kids. The ACCCE provides a capability that no single federal or state agency has by itself, provides a conduit for foreign law enforcement to tackle the borderless crime that is creating and sharing child abuse material. It has been joined by some world renowned child protection personnel now working right here in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year I got to visit the ACCCE in person, because it's located in my home town of Brisbane, and I spoke to the many dedicated employees and officers who are working there. The work done by each and every team member is incredible and we are really in their debt for the work that they do. I just want you to imagine the work that they do because it is hard to fathom. They work through thousands of reported images of the most disturbing nature. They are going through these materials and these pictures, intercepting messages across the dark web, posing in these forums as pedophiles themselves in order to infiltrate the networks of offenders producing and sharing this content. Many of them, as they are doing this, are parents themselves and have their own kids in the back of their minds. You cannot even come close to imagining the challenges that their work poses. A thankyou, a very real thankyou that we're expressing today as a House, doesn't even come close to expressing the gratitude that they deserve. That's why I have moved this motion in this place to thank them for all their efforts. The difference that they are making is profound. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently in this place, together with my friend the member for Macnamara, who's here, I launched a parliamentary Friends of Combating Child Exploitation in Australia and the ACCCE. It shows you what a bipartisan effort this particular field is. There are no politics when it comes to stopping child exploitation. I know that every member of the Labor Party is dedicated, as we are, to ensuring that it happens. The member for Macnamara's passion for this is greatly appreciated by me and other parents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the launch we heard from the Assistant Commissioner Northern Command, Lesa Gale, and Detective Sergeant Kate Laidler from the AFP victim identification unit, who provided an update on Operation Arkstone, which is being run from the ACCCE. Operation Arkstone has resulted in 46 children being removed from harm, including 16 from a childcare centre—these are kids in Australia right now—and 828 charges being laid. The victims range from 16 months to 15 years, with an average age of eight years old. The positions of the alleged offenders were childcare workers, a volunteer soccer coach, a disability support worker, an electrician, a supermarket employee and a chef. These are people who have been invested with a great deal of responsibility and trust by parents and our community, and they have abused it in the most horrible way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since its inception over the last two years, the ACCCE has led to 1,214 charges laid by the AFP, 161 arrests and 28,000 reports of child abuse triaged. We owe them our great thanks on behalf of all Australians for the tough work that they're doing for Australian families.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I second the motion. I'm pleased to follow the member for Ryan after his contribution and to support him in this motion. It is an important motion in the House. We on this side of the House are pleased to support it and to echo many of the sentiments expressed by the member for Ryan. We don't agree on everything, and the member for Ryan and I have sparred on a few different occasions, but on this we are absolutely united. I acknowledge him as the driving force in establishing this friendship group. I was pleased to support and help him and to co-chair, but I acknowledge his leadership and initiation of this important parliamentary friendship group. I hope that the need for it dissolves quickly, but I fear that is not going to be the case. I hope that as long as there is a need this friendship group established by the member for Ryan stands in this place as a counter to some of the horrific crimes and exploitation that we see of young Australians, some of our most vulnerable Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I received the call from the member for Ryan to be a part of this and to co-chair this organisation, it was of course an immediate yes, and it was of course an immediate call to action to be a part of and to help support our incredible frontline law enforcement officers. We had our first meeting on 8 December 2020. We were briefed by Assistant Commissioner Gale and Detective Acting Sergeant Laidler. They came into the parliament and gave a briefing on Operation Arkstone and all of the different facets of that operation. They were going into some detail about the level of infiltration of some of these circles that the Australian Federal Police does and that their members do on a daily basis. You could see that even though this is their job, even though they are in some ways hardened by this work and they are two fierce, strong Australian women serving in the Australian Federal Police, there is no doubt—and this was clear in their presentation—that for them and their colleagues turning up to work each and every day and being confronted by the sorts of material and images that they are trying to combat takes its toll. It does. It would take its toll on anyone. Personally, I couldn't imagine being in their shoes, having to get up and go through the daily grind of working in this space, but they do it because they know it's so important. For every child where they intercept and prevent something that will change the child's life for the worse, they are doing incredible work. They are literally saving lives each and every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I join the member for Ryan in saying that we don't just thank them for their work for the Australian Federal Police and for the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation but also are in fierce admiration of their work. We are in fierce admiration of the men and women who get up every single day to insert themselves in some of the most dark and predatory behaviours in our country in order to save and improve the welfare and the living experiences of our youngest and most vulnerable Australians. For that we say a deep thankyou. In this place, I'm very pleased to follow the member for Ryan in acknowledging them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only other bit I would like to say is that one thing that I've certainly come to appreciate and pick up as part of the experience of the friendship group is that it's often not strangers. There is obviously an online presence where there is predatory behaviour by people the young person doesn't know, but, as is so often the case, these crimes are committed by people who are known to the young person. I'm the father of a beautiful little girl, but I also used to work in a classroom, I used to work in child care and I used to work in kindergartens. It was great work and it was a lot of fun, but you also have a real sense of the responsibility and the duty of care that you have in those places. This is, unfortunately, work that must go on. I commend the member for Ryan for his leadership and initiative, and we on this side of the House stand in 100 per cent support of the government's actions in this space.</span>

A 42-year-old woman was arrested in the Philippines for her alleged role as a facilitator. As a result of the investigation, nine children were removed from harm. Last month, a 26-year-old Sydney male was arrested in his Lane Cove home as part of the AFP-led investigation called Operation Arkstone. He is facing child abuse material offences. Since beginning in February last year, Operation Arkstone has resulted in 17 arrests, 843 charges laid and 46 child victims removed from harm. Also last month, a 35-year-old male was arrested in Zetland, New South Wales, and charged with five counts of possessing child abuse material and one count of accessing child abuse material.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weeks ago, I noticed a media report that actually shocked me. For years, proud parents of school children would take snaps of their little ones on their first day of school and post them on social media, yet, in this media report, the AFP were advising parents not to make these photos publicly available, because it might put the child at risk of being groomed by one of the child predators. This was not just a precautionary warning. The AFP had actually seen instances of online grooming in which the predator used information from a parent's photo to get to the child.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are living in a world in which four out of five children aged four years are using the internet. According to recent research, 30 per cent of these four-year-olds have their own phone or tablet. Fifty per cent of children under the age of 12 have their own personal device and 50 per cent of all children have access to at least three different devices. Remarkably, the same research suggested that many parents were perhaps a little apathetic when it came to their children's online activities. Just three per cent of parents or carers listed online grooming as a concern, 16 per cent sought out information about online child exploitation, and 20 per cent of parents and carers are not comfortable talking to their children about online child sexual exploitation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we are living in a world now where our children have to be wary of online sexual predators. It is unacceptable to me and, I'm sure, to every other parent in this country. That's why the Australian government is investing millions of dollars every year to combat online child exploitation. In March 2018, the government and the AFP established the AFP-led Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation. The centre is committed to stopping child exploitation and abuse and is at the centre of a collaborative national approach to combatting organised child abuse. In the 2019-20 financial year, the centre made 161 arrests and removed 134 children from harm. This is a fantastic result, yet sadly the number of reports of child sexual exploitation is increasing. The following year there were more than 21,000 reports made—an increase of around 7,000. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the Lane Cove arrest last month, AFP Detective Superintendent Ben McQuillan said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our investigators have been combing through every image, video and communication since Operation Arkstone began, to find and bring to justice those who carelessly abuse and forever traumatise our children…</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the arrest in Zetland, AFP Detective Sergeant Jarryd Dunbar said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Online offenders may believe they are anonymous but they are not. It doesn't matter where they live, the AFP together with our partners across Australia and around the world are keeping a watch on every corner to protect our children…</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The message is clear: the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation, in partnership with other agencies and task forces, with the support of the federal government, will track down and arrest anyone involved in the abuse and exploitation of children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The more we can educate our kids about stranger danger online, the more savvy they will be and the less likely they will be at risk. I was somewhat heartened during a visit last week to Tullawong State School in my electorate of Longman when I spoke to students about Safer Internet Day. Quite of a few of the young students, particularly those who play games like <span style="font-style:italic;">Roblox</span> online with their friends, were savvy about not interacting with strangers online. One boy even said that he would check with his friends to make sure that the person in the game was actually who they claimed to be. It's a start. The much-needed growth in awareness and education is beginning to come through, but it is not fast enough. Let's all do our part to educate our kids and grandkids when it comes to e-safety.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  I thank the member for Ryan for moving this important motion on the ACCCE and recognise his ongoing interest in this issue and the advocacy that he has done in this House on this cause since being elected. It is a cause that is shared by all of us in this building. There wouldn't be a single member of parliament from any political party of any particular persuasion that would not be as equally committed to stamping out this most heinous, most repulsive and most revolting of crimes—child abuse. The motion rightly recognises the outstanding work done by the Australian Federal Police and, in particular, the ACCCE. I'm pleased to support this motion that recognises this vital work and the role that our law enforcement agencies and policymakers across the spectrum play in keeping our children safe from predators. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were more than 21,000 reports of child exploitation to the ACCCE in 2019-20. All of us in this place agree that the ACCCE and the AFP perform many crucial investigative, intelligence and national security functions in this fight, and we can all agree that this cause should be above politics of any kind. We can have differences of approach. We can discuss the best way to deal with this scourge. But we do it in good faith. We do it knowing that all sides of this chamber are trying to get to the same end goal. The ACCCE's objective to free children from exploitation through its four pillars would be supported by all members—preparing future capabilities and technologies to counter child exploitation, preventing the exploitation of children, intervening earlier in the abuse of victims, protecting victims from further victimisation, protecting the wellbeing of members and supporting authorities to pursue and prosecute child sex offenders and remove victims from harm. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Child exploitation didn't stop with lockdowns during COVID-19. It never takes a break. Unfortunately, this is a crime that is growing exponentially. Officers have continued to be at the coalface, fighting this crime during the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, child exploitation cases more than doubled in the first months of COVID-19. The AFP laid 1,078 child exploitation charges against 144 people in the 10 months to May 2020. It's an outstanding job, but it reflects a horrific reality. The officers at the AFP have worked tirelessly throughout 2020 to keep Australian children safe. As the motion notes, recent operations in Australia removed 16 children from harm and arrested 44 offenders, laying 350 charges against them collectively. It's worth reflecting on what those statistics mean in the real world, what the consequences of those actions by the AFP mean to those children. The mind boggles. It's an incredible contribution that these officers have made. The AFP has also assisted with eight international arrests over the 12 months to November 2020.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These officers do an incredible service to our nation and to children across Australia, but they need our support in the work that they do. Child exploitation is a heinous crime and the officers who do this work are exposed to images and to situations that are traumatising, that are horrific, that none of us even like to think about, let alone confront face to face. We really need to make sure that, as a government, we support AFP officers who do this critical work to ensure they get access to the services and support that they need so that they aren't paying a price for doing this invaluable work for the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us have a role to play in this fight against child abuse and child exploitation, in this fight to stamp it out. Law enforcement is on the front line against offenders, but all of us—in our communities and in our families, as parents, as family members—have a role to play in having a hard conversation with our families, with our children about these risks. As the member for Longman rightly pointed out in his contribution, it's hard to have these conversations. It's awkward. It makes us feel terrible. But we need to confront this for the sake of our children. So have that conversation with kids about knowing who they're engaging with on the internet, about knowing what the risks confronting them are. It's uncomfortable, it's awkward, but it's a small price to pay in the face of statistics that are, frankly, horrifying and that show the growing nature of this threat around the world. All of us have a role to play in this chamber, in our communities, in our families, and I thank all Australians who are united in their common purpose to fight against this scourge against children in our society.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  As I've said in this chamber previously, no group in our community is more deserving of our protection than our children. I'm extremely proud of the government's commitment and tangible action to ensure our children are kept safe from harm and that offenders are brought to justice, and I'm very encouraged by the bipartisan support that we see in this place for this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has provided the Australian Federal Police with $68.6 million to drive a world-leading response to counter child sexual abuse. As part of this funding, in September 2018 the Minister for Home Affairs announced the launch of the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation, a world-leading centre coordinating responses to counter the online exploitation of children. Collaboration is key to addressing the scourge that is online child sexual abuse. The ACCCE works closely with the states and territories joint exploitation teams—JACETs—as well as with international law enforcement counterparts, industry, nongovernment organisations and research bodies to strengthen the domestic and global responses to these crimes. It was this very collaboration between the Tasmanian JACET, the AFP and the ACCCE that was responsible for a warrant executed against a Tasmanian man in December, who was charged with child exploitation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We like to think that abusers don't live in our own backyards, but they do. They are our neighbours and in our community and often in positions of trust. Just last week in Hobart, a man who worked at a local childcare centre was charged with producing child exploitation material. In my own northern Tasmanian community, a Riverside man was charged last year with child exploitation after a lengthy AFP investigation as part of Operation Molto. Operation Molto is the most recent ACCCE coordinated national operation, involving police in all Australian states and territories, and has led to 65 offenders being charged with 525 offences and 18 children being removed from harm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a very difficult statistic to say out loud, and it brings home the point that these operations are not just about numbers. The fact that 18 innocent children were abused is horrifying and utterly devastating. Sadly, too, as the pandemic has brought a variety of challenges, COVID has also seen a significant increase in the amount of child abuse material downloaded successfully on the dark web. Between April and June of last year there was an average increase of about 163 per cent in activity compared to the same period in the year before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has made the protection of children a priority and has reformed laws to achieve this aim. In September 2019, the Combatting Child Sexual Exploitation Legislation Amendment Act came into effect in response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. It addresses difficulties that operational agencies face in investigating and prosecuting new child sexual abuse related trends. Additionally, I spoke in the chamber last year in passionate support of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Act 2020, which came into force in June last year. This legislated a number of much-needed measures, including mandatory minimum penalties of at least four years imprisonment for the most serious offences and for repeat offenders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Proper funding and effective legislation to both track down and sentence offenders are necessary but it is imperative that we instil protective behaviour in our children, teaching them how to keep themselves safe online and offline. Recent ACCCE research indicates that only 52 per cent of Australian parents and carers talk to their children about online safety, which is a really scary statistic. As a parent of five myself, I know that I am concerned about the amount of time that my children spend online and recognise that I need to have continuing conversations with them to ensure that they're protected when they're on their devices. The eSafety Commissioner website and the thinkuknow.org.au website, along with terrific organisations such as Bravehearts and The Alannah and Madeline Foundation, are great resources for parents and carers. They have an incredible amount of useful tools and information available to help so that we're all better equipped to deal with the challenges online and to teach our kids to protect themselves.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the House an hour or so ago, there was a very good debate on the role that social media platforms have played in spreading hate and disinformation generally. That debate was during a private member's motion brought by the member for Mallee, Dr Webster, who herself has been targeted in the most egregious way on social media.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But many people in the community are affected by what is occurring online. The social media platforms must do better in facing up to their responsibilities. This stuff does not happen in print or on broadcast media at anywhere near the frequency that it does online. Perhaps that's because over the years and decades laws have managed to keep pace with community standards. The same can't be said about the online world. The internet has been part of our world for 30 years now and is inextricably woven into every aspect of our lives, but it's still like the Wild West.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the elected representatives of our nation, we have a duty to keep the internet as free as possible while ensuring that it remains in line with community standards. That means pretty much extending the same standard to platforms that we expect of newspapers and television stations. However, we have grown accustomed to thinking that this stuff happens on the margins of the net, in the grimy underbelly of the dark web and peer-to-peer portals. But it is happening in full view, on popular shopping websites accessed by millions of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent weeks, I have joined a campaign launched jointly by Victorian designer Anna Cordell and a group called the Collective Shout which seeks to get child abuse material and products off the popular shopping website Etsy. I mentioned this campaign in passing a few weeks ago in the House, but it's worth raising again. Etsy is a very popular, US based website which millions of Australians, mostly women, use to purchase gifts and crafts. Many Australians also sell their own goods on the platform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members will be shocked to learn that Etsy, which describes itself as a 'mindful, transparent and humane' business and which caters overwhelmingly to women looking for handcrafted and unique products, is also platforming child sexual abuse material. As <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph </span>reported two weeks ago, alongside handmade baby blankets you can buy rape dolls—they call them 'child sex dolls', but they are rape dolls—resembling children as young as 10. One is listed as having the height and weight of a 12-year-old and is photographed in teenage clothing. The listing promises 'discreet shipping' and plain brown boxes. These dolls are illegal in Australia. Importing one can cost you more than half a million dollars in fines and up to 10 years in prison. As of December last year, ABF has seized 191, up from 145 the year before. Also on Etsy, alongside gifts for Father's Day, you can buy T-shirts and underwear with slogans including 'Daddy's Little—' and I won't include the word, 'whore', and 'Daddy's Little—' and I won't include the word, 'slut', and others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Anna Cordell was made aware of the disgusting material that her products were being sold alongside, she left Etsy and started a petition demanding that the products be removed, that the sellers be banned and that Etsy commit to ensuring that its site remains free of such material in the future. To date the petition has gathered more than 33,000 signatures, including my own, and I would certainly encourage members to join us. Unfortunately, Etsy appears to have turned a deaf ear. Some of the material is no longer there, but the sellers are still there. Etsy has not issued any public statement committing to keeping the site clean. This week Anna wrote to the Etsy CEO and board asking, 'How do factory-produced sex dolls and child sexual abuse fit with Etsy's stated values?' She continues: 'I am struggling to understand why, despite the petition, media coverage and widespread condemnation, you continue to remain silent.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Etsy's board is well credentialed. Some very fine people are on there. But they cannot hide behind the facade of their decency. They are complicit. They know about this now. They've been told that this material exists. They must act. They must get this material off their website. It is disgusting. There's no place for it. These well-credentialed, fine, upstanding citizens on the board of Etsy have nowhere to hide. If they don't remove this material, they are complicit in the crime of selling it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  Firstly, I would like to commend both the member for Ryan and the member for Macnamara for bringing this motion to the Federation Chamber today and indeed commend both of them for starting the parliamentary friendship group on combating child exploitation. I've signed up to that group, and I again commend them for starting that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former police officer, detective and investigator, I unfortunately not only have seen this type of material but also have dealt with the victims of child sexual assault and sexual abuse. I would like to pay tribute to those investigators who deal with it day after day after day, whether it's the Federal Police or state specialist investigators. In my 12 short years as a police officer, whether as a detective or as a police prosecutor, nothing affected me more personally than having to view this material. It was so incredibly difficult as a detective dealing with children who were so young that they couldn't express what had happened to them; they were that small. We as a society, and the structure that surrounds these investigators, must support these officers every step of the way. Otherwise, they will simply fall by the wayside. These are images and situations that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. We owe it to them to support them as much as we possibly can, as much as we owe it to our children to protect them from these monsters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sometimes struggle with the concept of good and evil, but with this it's very simple: this is nothing but evil. These people are not the types of people who can be rehabilitated. Yet in society they are just another person, just another businessperson or the person who lives next door. You can't pick them out. I think that was shown in the recent investigation Operation Arkstone that the assistant commissioner spoke about at the parliamentary friends group that we went to. That was in the electorate just next to mine, and I remember reading about it in the local paper. One thing that struck me was one of the mums said, 'My husband said to me something wasn't right; there was something just not right about that.' I have said before that, if you think something is not right, you should go with your gut. I'd rather apologise to somebody for getting it wrong than apologise to my child or somebody else's child for not actually doing something, for not actually taking that step. I think that, as parents, we have that heightened sense of when something isn't right. So don't sit back. Don't stay quiet. If Mum, Dad or a caregiver think there's something wrong then they have an obligation to look into it. They have an obligation to start asking those questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You also have an obligation to educate yourself about the Internet, about apps, about the websites that your children are looking at. Something that I cannot comprehend is that over the last 12 months, during COVID, this type of material and people using it increased 163 per cent. It's just unbelievable that we in a society have people who are prepared to engage in this, but it's fact. If we have people who are prepared to engage in that in Australia then we must increase all of our efforts and we have increased all of our efforts to target these people, to put them in the only place that they should be in the absence of capital punishment: in jail for a very long time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the members for Ryan and Macnamara for bringing this to this place. I will continue to advocate on behalf of not only children but also the investigators.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Economic prosperity fairly shared must play a central role in our national agenda, but, in order for Australia and Australians to truly thrive, it should be embedded in a larger story of wellbeing, of people, of communities and of the places we live and love. My argument is that, if we take the approach of national wellbeing and national economic growth being indivisible and if we measure and report on both at the same time, Australia can be a country that not only is excellent in a crisis but also takes full advantage of prosperity in all of its dimensions. Right now we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to, as economist Kate Raworth has put it, 'change the goal'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Previous generations have done it. Between 1901 and the first World War, Australia built a thriving democracy based on the living wage, supplemented by an aged pension, an interventionist state and a near-universal franchise that included women but, sadly, not First Nations people. After World War II, Australian governments committed to full employment, mass migration, a huge expansion of housing and, later, the broadening of tertiary education. From the eighties, sweeping reforms deregulated and opened the economy; expanded the social wage with Medicare, family support and superannuation; and better protected the environment. These kinds of profound national changes all followed crises which impacted health, wealth and wellbeing, and in all instances political leaders and leaders from civil society, business and unions addressed immediate challenges but also took one step back to forge a simple, compelling narrative for reform that the population could rally behind and that would endure. Now, more than 40 years since the last period of major change, we can decide to view the health, social and economic damage wrought by COVID-19 as also providing the conditions for a re-imagining and renewal of the country we love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the events of summer 2019, 2020 and now, sadly, 2021, we were all aware that Australia is a country of people who care about not just their physical and mental health but also that of their families and friends. They cherish connection to community, are concerned about the health of the natural environment and the planet their children will inherit, and want to live in a society that is broadly equal and fair. But COVID-19 and devastating bushfires demonstrated to all of us how fragile what we value the most really is. Right now, we have an opportunity to decide how we as a nation can secure what we value. We can not only judge the economic sense of our recovery from the global pandemic; we can also decide to set our collective trajectory towards a future where prosperity is harnessed to deliver a uniquely Australian concept of national wellbeing, and we can decide to measure our success not just by how swiftly the economy rebounds but also by whether our country is meeting identified measures of what we value as necessary for a good society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Measuring wellbeing is neither a new nor a radical suggestion. Simon Kuznets devised a measure of national income after the Great Depression and he noted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income ...</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Infamously, the American Senator Kennedy described GDP as measuring everything except that which we hold dear. Once, Australia led the world in this area. The ABS was the first national statistical organisation to measure wellbeing. In 2004, the Australian Treasury developed a wellbeing framework, which was sadly discarded by this government, and in 2013 the Australian National Sustainability Council produced measures of sustainable wellbeing, which was work also discontinued by this government. And we now have a Treasurer who has mocked the suggestion of a wellbeing budget, which ignores both the history of GDP development and the modern international trends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Various international jurisdictions have considered what a national account of wellbeing might look like—for example, France's Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission, the OECD High-Level Expert Group on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the New Zealand wellbeing budget, and the work undertaken in Scotland, Iceland and here in the ACT. We should be developing an Australian approach. I suggest a quadruple-bottom-line approach to measuring national wellbeing. Economy, society, environment and democracy could provide the foundations, and the specific line items under each of those measures could reflect a modern Australian description of what is required for or what constitutes a good society. We know we have plenty to build on with our pioneering work in the past and the strength within our communities and institutions. We can emerge from this current crisis with national policy settings which ensure that we grow not only wealthy but also wise and well, working towards the future we want together. It won't happen without a government committed to introducing a framework within which to do it, and I commend a wellbeing budget as a central part of such a framework.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282986" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  I rise today to highlight and defend Australia's profound dedication to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and our post COVID recovery. I think there are very few people in Australia who don't actually believe that we are in a very good position in this country and that we are very lucky to be Australians. That is not down to any accident; that is down to the good governance of this country by the federal parliament, led by the Morrison government, the state governments and territories working together and, indeed, local councils. Australia actually should be celebrating our achievements in the year 2020. That's not to say that quite remarkable tragedies haven't happened across this great country, but the framework that has been put in place—firstly, the response to the bushfires, followed by the response to COVID in 2020—is something to be remarked on and celebrated in this great nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to firstly say that our response to COVID has been quite special and unique internationally. Australia took very early steps to close its borders internationally. That was internationally regarded as something quite unexpected. In fact, when you speak to experts who informed the evidence for that decision, you understand that it was a decision that had not been made lightly and had not been undertaken without a great deal of discussion and forethought. Indeed, the decision to close the borders was the greatest public health decision made in this country. That included bringing quarantine measures to Christmas Island so that those who were returning initially from Wuhan returned through Christmas Island. There was great international outcry that this was a negative step, but it has been seen to be a very important first step to keeping this country safe. Then there has been a whole ream of measures undertaken for aggressive suppression, understanding we remain connected internationally to the rest of the world but knowing we have to learn to live with this virus. We can't lock down the whole country without making sure we are keeping the economy safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would like to say is that the dual economic and health crisis that this country has faced has been well addressed by this government's response to COVID, and, more importantly than that, this government cares about the things that are important to Australians. That includes the dignity and respect of having a job. We can see that clear philosophical understanding by this government, about the respect people have for the dignity of work, in the economic response which was JobKeeper. I have had so many of my constituents write to me, email me and phone me about what a lifesaver JobKeeper has been. Last week the Prime Minister came to visit Higgins, and I was able to introduce the Prime Minister to a number of businesses in my local electorate and show him the impact JobKeeper has had, with the temporary transitional support given to them to help them through what has been an unprecedented health and economic crisis in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue about JobKeeper is the philosophical underpinning that it was about keeping employees connected to their jobs, connected to their workplaces, connected to the dignity of work. We are seeing now that JobKeeper has been a wonderful transition to the other side of COVID. We are now in a good position nationally, albeit unfortunately still in lockdown in Victoria, for the COVID vaccine rollout that is coming at speed. The COVID vaccine rollout gives this country a very important opportunity. I welcome the COVID vaccine national rollout, and I hope all Australians get behind this in a bipartisan way because this is going to give us, as a country, an opportunity to get in control of the COVID pandemic in a way that would not have been foreseen one year ago. Being a medical researcher myself, I know that the speed with which this vaccine has been developed and manufactured, and is now about to be rolled out, is unprecedented in medical research history. It is in fact a modern miracle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has got behind this vaccine development and rollout with investments, with partnering. To have the vaccine developed, grown and manufactured here onshore is a really good thing for the Australian population. It will, hopefully, turn COVID from a deadly disease into a serious and nuisance disease. In order to do that, we need to get behind the COVID vaccine rollout. To go forward as an economy and as a nation, we need to have the trust and respect of the Australian people. I think 2020 has shown that we have a government that is sensible, that is pragmatic, that is not ideologically driven and that is going to continue to lead Australia to better outcomes going forward.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  I thank the member for Dunkley for this motion. The wellbeing of people is clearly linked to the health of the economy, society and environment. But Australians shouldn't be surprised that, as the motion says, under the Morrison government Australia now ranks 37th in the world on the SDG index for its long-term direction. Indeed, on numerous critical measures Australia has been falling behind the rest of the world after more than seven years of this Liberal government. Australia is less productive, more unequal, more corrupt, less happy, more indebted, less affluent and less trusting of public institutions than when this mob over here were elected in 2013. That is nothing to do with the pandemic; it is the government's record. Global rankings and independent reputable data show that the Liberals mismanaged the economy badly for seven years before the COVID-19 pandemic, just as they're now mismanaging the recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we hear the government say every day in question time 'our economic plan'—they keep talking about the economic plan—is to cover up the fact there is no plan: 'If we say "plan" a lot, people will believe there's a plan.' The truth is that the Liberals are hopeless economic managers. They hate hearing this because it is part of the myth, the brand propaganda, that people think they manage the economy well: 'Yeah, we're nasty, divided, cruel, out of touch and rich, but that doesn't matter; we're okay with the economy. Don't worry about the truth.' But the facts don't lie. Examine their record of failure in their eighth year of government. Real wages were lower in 2019; after six years of this government, real wages were lower in Australia than they were when this government was elected. We are third-last in the OECD globally for wage growth. Well done, government! Working families have less in their pockets than they had when this mob over there were elected. The government's response to this: new laws to allow bosses to cut wages. What a great idea!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shockingly, the latest OECD figures show Australia's economic productivity in negative territory. Under Labor productivity growth was the 10th highest in the OECD. Under the Liberals it ranked fifth last. Australia's housing market is now the third most unaffordable in the OECD. The government's response: wheel out nutty backbenchers to say, 'Let everyone spend their super on housing and push up the cost of housing'. What a brilliant idea!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been said, our health response was led by state premiers and ranks eighth in the world for success. But the latest comparative OECD data shows Australia lagging badly behind in the jobs recovery, at 18th out of 28 nations. In 2010, under Labor, after the GFC Australia ranked fifth in the world for jobs performance. Today we rank just 18th. Even $1 billion of taxpayer funded advertising from the Prime Minister, the failed marketing man, is not enough to change the fact, or cover up the fact, that our economic performance was failing badly before COVID-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard about JobKeeper from the previous speaker. Australia's only weathering the recession because of the wage subsidy schemes and the boost to social security that Labor and the unions proposed. For weeks last year this marketing guy, the Prime Minister, refused to act. Tens of thousands of Australians joined the unemployment queue in that gap, who should have remained attached to their employer. Eventually he introduced JobKeeper, a scheme so well designed that it has been milked by millionaires and billionaires to pay themselves executive bonuses. That just goes on the national debt. Well done, government! We should really thank you for that!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, a few weeks ago the Prime Minister turned up to the National Press Club to try a bit more spin to try and cover up and distract from this record of failure. Mr Dennis Atkins aptly wrote afterwards:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It was the speech of someone who doesn't think deeply and whose vision extends only to the bathroom mirror.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve more from this government than a failed marketing man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the PM won the 2019 election he opened his victory speech by asking: how good is Australia? He has since developed the truly inane habit of repeating that question over and over and over again. But an honest answer to the inane question in the eighth year of this government is: not as good anymore. Australia's economy is going backwards and Australians are being left behind by the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Facts still matter. As the member for Dunkley said, Australia is more than just the economy. The health of our society is about the environment and education outcomes. Have a look at education outcomes. Australian children are now outperformed by their peers in 23 countries in mathematics, 12 countries in science and 10 countries in reading. Performance in maths and science under this government, relative to the rest of the world, has fallen. Degree costs for students are amongst the highest in the world. The average annual student borrowing jumped 36.7 per cent in four years. Well done, government! We're happy about that. It's not good enough, but the Prime Minister tells us we're leading the world. We're leading the world in vaccines are we, government? We just heard that from the previous speaker. There are two continents in the world where you can't get a vaccine: Australia and Antarctica. Around the world 140 million people have been vaccinated. We're at the front of the queue are we? It's all a load of marketing spin. The facts speak for themselves.</span>

                  <a href="80072" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HAMMOND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  I thank the member for Dunkley for moving this motion and for making some of the points she did. I agree with the basic premise that it is wrong to separate the wellbeing of our people from the health of our economy, our society and our environment. Having a strong economy is not, and should never be, a standalone goal. No government should ever pursue a strong economy simply to tick a box or to say how great we are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my first speech to parliament: a strong economy is dependent upon ensuring that our country has all of the essential services and ingredients which are vital to our national wellbeing. We need educated, skilled, healthy people. We need quality infrastructure. We need social services to help those in need and we need a secure, protected and safe country so we can deliver a strong economy. But we need a strong economy to deliver each of those. They are entwined.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a strong economy to ensure that people have the opportunity to reach their full potential and to provide the choice and freedom to people to live their best lives. A strong economy is the gateway to what Australians value. It's the gateway that ensures Australia has a world-class health system, which provides universal access to affordable medical services. It's the gateway to investment and innovative thinking so that we can get our best minds tackling environmental challenges, tackling health crises. It's the gateway to creativity, the arts, leisure, sports—all of the things which broaden our lives and bring us joy. Having a strong economy ensures that, when something like COVID-19 comes along, the government is in the best position it is able to be in to support the Australian people with support measures like JobKeeper, JobSeeker and JobMaker. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I actually agree with the member for Dunkley that governments shouldn't solely measure economic success. We also need to measure and monitor outcomes in other areas. The government does this already through a variety of existing mechanisms. Because of the lack of time, let me simply focus on health. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017, the Australian government, with states and territories, agreed to the Australian Health Performance Framework—a vehicle to support system-wide reporting on Australia's health and healthcare performance. This was followed in December 2019 with the release of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's 'national front door', which serves as a navigation tool to access data on the health of all Australians. As we can see from the national front door, Australia's health and wellbeing are improving in certain areas. For example, in 2017 there were 324 acute coronary events per 100,000 people compared to 379 per 100,000 in 2013. But the national front door also notes things that warrant attention, such as the increase in deaths by suicide. There were 12.1 suicides per 100,000 people in 2018 compared to 10.7 in 2009.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to recognise that the government responds to and is informed by these realities, because all of us recognise that behind a health statistic is an individual. Governments must always strive to use the data they have at hand to direct policymaking and improve outcomes. We can see how the government is responding to these measures and the monitoring of different systems by how it is responding to the increases in suicide and mental illness. It includes the Fifth National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan and the recent launch by the government of the first phase of the $89.5 million intergenerational health and mental health study, which will focus on mental health and wellbeing. Actions like the fifth national plan and the intergenerational plan help inform our long-term direction. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economy is not some separate entity from individuals, nor is the wellbeing of individuals separate from the economy. They are interrelated and they must be. As the Productivity Commission's report into mental health that was released last year showed, the cost of lost productivity due to mental health was conservatively $12 billion. But we also know that you cannot measure mental illness purely in monetary terms. No government should ever be single-mindedly driven by economics, and we're not.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Dunkley. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought uncertainty to all of our lives. We've lost loved ones, we've been separated from family and friends, we've faced lockdowns, businesses have folded and jobs have been lost. As our country begins to show the first signs of recovery, there is a growing sense that we need to change how we measure the success of our nation—to move beyond the traditional metrics of national income, such as GDP, as indicators of success, and to develop a new way of capturing our overall wellbeing as a country. COVID-19 has been a stark reminder to all of us that it's impossible to separate our wellbeing from the health of our economy, our society or the environment. Considering more than just national account figures to capture our national success—to focus on the economy, of course, and the health of our society, our environment and the strength of our democracy—could provide the foundations for a post-COVID-19 or COVID-normal approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A wellbeing approach or wellbeing budget would provide an opportunity for a genuine whole-of-government, joined-up approach. The COVID pandemic has highlighted the need for such a joined-up, whole-of-government approach, especially in mental health. Mental health isn't just a health issue. Your mental health is impacted by where you were born, where you live, where you work and your age. These underlying causes can impact our lives suddenly and often without warning: insecure work, housing stress and financial hardship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In its prebudget submission for 2020-21, Mental Health Australia said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is clear evidence for the need to address the social determinants of mental health in order to reduce the impacts of mental illness. … Australian research has found people who have recently experienced financial hardship are 23% more likely to experience decreased mental health in the next year, and people experiencing severe psychological distress are 89% more likely to experience financial hardship in the next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That explains so many people and their circumstances last year and into this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even before the pandemic, inequality was rising and wages were stagnating; COVID-19 has only made things worse, exposing the fault lines in our society, particularly in regional and remote communities. At the height of the pandemic there were 36 jobseekers for every job vacancy on the Central Coast, where I live. There were nearly 5,000 businesses with close to 19,000 employees on JobKeeper and many are fearful of what may happen when support is cut in March. It is measures like a wage subsidy, called for by Labor, which led to the UN Sustainable Development Goals index ranking Australia well for our management of the COVID crisis. However, the same index ranks our long-term direction at 37th.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Sunday, before parliament came back, the Treasurer appeared on <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> and ruled out the possibility of extending JobKeeper, stating that it was always a temporary program. The Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe expressed concern about job shedding after JobKeeper is removed. The January Sensis Business Index highlighted 'increasing distress about the loss of the JobKeeper lifeline that saved hundreds of thousands of businesses from going under due to COVID-19 lockdowns.' From the survey, 60 per cent of transport owners said the loss of JobKeeper would have a major impact, up from 25 per cent in November, and 36 per cent of health and community services said the loss would have a major impact—again, up from almost 24 per cent. And 35 per cent of manufacturing businesses said it would have a major impact, up from 21 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can talk about a recovery and say that we are all in this together, but businesses and industry, particularly in some communities and sectors, are jittery. In the National Suicide Prevention Advisor's interim advice, one of the main recommendations was that the government should develop a Commonwealth process for reviewing new policies or initiatives to ensure that they assess any impacts, positively or negatively, on suicidal risk or behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has consistently declared mental health to be a priority, and I believe that the Prime Minister is genuine in this commitment. The release of the Productivity Commission's final report on mental health gives the government a pathway towards reform. In his Press Club speech on 1 February the Prime Minister declared that there would be a new national agreement on mental health and suicide prevention this year. But what people across Australia need is action now. It's urgent. The delayed release of the Productivity Commission report wasted valuable time in which to begin implementing recommendations and actions of the report and the chance to respond in the October budget. This delay has also meant that no announcements were made during the October budget. The May budget is now only three months away, and the government's response: a mental health committee to report on the findings of reports stemming from the committee which began its work in 2018.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't go back to the old ways of measuring wealth in society. We must look beyond income and start measuring our society as a whole. This will help us to emerge from this crisis a fairer, healthier society.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="203092" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZIMMERMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:16</span>):  I want to start by acknowledging the member for Dunkley for moving this motion today on COVID-19 and the economy. The thing we can agree on in relation to the motion is the importance of remembering that the wellbeing of a nation and its people is a lot more than economic statistics—a concept the Deputy Speaker might find hard to fathom, but it is certainly true that there are a range of measures that should judge a nation and how well it's performing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the disappointing aspect of this motion—and it's a disappointment that we see consistently through what the opposition is doing in this place—is its glass-half-empty approach to Australia. Unfortunately the opposition, at every opportunity, is determined to talk down Australia and its achievements. That is implicit in the wording of the motion we have before us today. It's a disappointing approach, because if there's anything we should have learnt from the last 12 months it is how high we can hold our heads as Australians on the global stage. Our response to the COVID pandemic has been to deal with an individual crisis, but through that response Australians and their governments have demonstrated all that is good about our nation and the reasons we are such a success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is something I see in my own electorate. I see the greatness of Australians in helping each other. It is true to say that my electorate, by relative standards, is an affluent one. But it is still an electorate where there is so often a need for support for those who are more vulnerable. And I see, through the range of voluntary organisations that exist in my electorate, Australians coming to support each other. I also see that Australia is, despite what the opposition would have you believe, such a successful nation. As part of our duties as local members of parliament we all attend citizenship ceremonies, and it is fair to say that we get such a phenomenal response from those new citizens, who are so excited to be joining the Australian family because they recognise that there is no better place on earth to be making their home and their future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to turn to the health aspects of wellbeing that are being raised in this motion. Again, I think the past 12 months have demonstrated the extraordinary success of Australia in achieving the wellbeing of its citizens. For example, the Lowy Institute has rated Australia in the top 10 nations in terms of managing the health consequences and the economic consequences of the COVID pandemic. Being in the top 10 nations of almost 200 is something we can be exceptionally proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also perhaps a time to remind those on the other side about what the Morrison government is doing to improve not only the nation's economy but also the health and wellbeing of all Australians, outside the conditions of the pandemic that we're seeing at the moment. Combined with strong and decisive action taken by this government and informed by expert advice, Australia's world-class health system guarantees universal access to affordable medical services and is ranked No. 2 in the world by the respected and independent Commonwealth Fund. That is why we have been so well prepared to meet the challenges of COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the government has continued to make significant investments to support access to high-quality medical services, along with longer-term reforms. Whether it's our strong support for Medicare—our NHS, but I would argue a lot better and more successful than the NHS—the support we're giving for life-saving medicines and their availability at low cost to Australians, our achievements in achieving a record level of bulk-billing, our investment in medical research to make Australia the leader it is and can further be in medical research and science, or the work that I've seen as chair of the House's health committee—all of these things point to the incredible contribution that we as a government, that we as a nation are making to the wellbeing of Australians when it comes to health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Health Reform Agreement sets a clear reform direction for all Australian governments to ensure we can help reduce pressures on public hospitals, shift more towards hospital avoidance programs and increase sustainability while improving peoples' health. The numbers speak for themselves: a record four-year investment of $467 billion into health; investment into Medicare of $119.3 billion over 2020-21; $41 billion for medicines funding and the creation of the new PBS New Medicines Funding Guarantee; ensuring hospital capacity with a $133.6 billion investment over five years. This points to the type of work that this government is getting on with. Of course we can make our nation better—the task of government is never-ending—but we can be so proud of all that Australia has achieved and will continue to achieve.</span>

                  <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  This is an important motion moved by my friend the member for Dunkley, and it raises some important questions about where we're going as an economy and, more profoundly, how we are doing as a society, and how we might do better. I was pleased to be in the chamber for the remarks of the member for North Sydney. He talked about his disappointment. Well, what disappoints me about the member for North Sydney and, indeed, about his government is their view that they are entitled not only to their world view, but to their own facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion clearly sets out some facts that should be concerning to all Australians. This government is a government that seems resistant to truth telling in every aspect. We have seen that this morning. We have seen that in its response not only to the great challenge of closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, but also to responding to the generous offer that First Nations people have given us to walk with them on their terms, not on the terms of this government. So I am disappointed that the member for North Sydney and the government, of which he is a part, can't accept these facts or some of the challenging statistics that the motion before us sets out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does set out the great achievements of our economic growth, and that's something that we should celebrate; but we can't look at that in isolation from some of its consequences, in particular the increase in inequality. This is something that has been shown to all of us as local members. It's so readily apparent and hard to ignore, through the experience of COVID and the pandemic response, where the gaps between those who have and those who have not have been so cruelly exposed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion really asks us to consider two things: inequality and the consequences of growth. I would have thought that was a matter that members from all side of politics would be conscious of. It is the case that Australia is becoming a more unequal society. For me, that's a moral challenge. For those of us on the Labor side, it is a moral challenge. But we know now that there is an emerging economic consensus that this is actually a barrier to growth. It is something we need to respond to if we're going to ensure our economic recovery is all that it could and should be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have to reflect on the experience, more broadly, of the pandemic, what it has revealed, the gaps in our safety net that have been cruelly exposed, and also for us to think about what really matters to us as communities and as a nation. We know the things that we decide to measure really matter. They drive the decisions we make in this place; they drive the work of the public service; they drive our political debate. I share the member for Dunkley's conviction—also so eloquently expressed recently by the member for Dobell—based on her experience as a representative, and in her former life, that we need, as a government, to take a broader perspective on these matters. We need to ask, as the English commentator Will Huttner said, 'How good can we be?' not to cheerily talk about 'how good is', as the present Prime Minister is so fond of doing, and to seek to mark our progress towards this goal of a good society, of a country every bit as good as the Australian people, all of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't a novel concept that's being advanced today. The shadow Treasurer, when he talked about the need to measure things more broadly, referred back to Robert Kennedy's1968 remarks that GDP 'measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.' In this place all of us but particularly those who occupy the government benches for now have the opportunity and also the obligation to do whatever we can to make life worthwhile for all Australians. We have the tools that will help us do this internationally, with the sustainable development goals and the work of the OECD, which is something that members opposite should have regard to. Yet the Treasurer seems to think this is something that's worthy of mockery, often in offensive terms. This is unworthy. He should have a look around the community that he represents and recognise that we are less equal in Australia right now than we were before the pandemic and that this is getting worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the pandemic, we were headed in the wrong direction. We can't continue down this path. We have often heard said in this place and elsewhere by politicians on all sides that we are all in it together, but, until we take a more rounded approach to measuring the work of government, we will not all be in this together. We need to turn this around. We need to recognise and honour the sacrifices of ordinary Australians by building a future that's secure for all of us.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among the many other harmful effects of this COVID-19 pandemic, one very damaging consequences is going to prove extremely difficult to reverse. Australians already are the world's biggest gamblers, and today they are spending, betting and losing more than ever before. A survey of more than 2,000 adults who gambled, conducted by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, has found that one in three Australian gamblers has opened more betting accounts during COVID-19. The number of adults who gamble more than four times every week has increased by 40 per cent. Young men aged 18 to 34, who are already some of our most at-risk gamblers, have increased their average spending from $687 to $1,075 during this pandemic despite losing access to casinos, betting shops and racetracks for much of this year. Disturbingly, 79 per cent of adults who gamble were classified in the study based on their responses as being at risk of or already experiencing gambling related harm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gambling in Australia results in enormous financial, personal and social costs to our community, and these are only rising. It ruins many thousands of lives and robs ordinary families of almost $25 billion each year. It's for this reason that I will always advocate strongly against gambling's further promotion and proliferation in our country. We are running short on time today, so I want to spend the last couple of minutes talking about what this government has done and what we need to be doing more of to protect Australians in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge this government's efforts in restricting live sport betting. I cannot tell you how many families, how many mums and dads, have approached me and spoken to me about the prolific nature of gambling in sport. We all know. We've all watched different types of sport and been bombarded with live sport betting. What concerns me the most, particularly around young people, is that, when I was growing up—even when you were growing up all those many years ago, Mr Deputy Speaker Falinski—we used to be able to tell you who was playing full-forward for Collingwood or St Kilda or who was a basketballer or NRL player, but now it's not just about the players; it's about the odds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the way sport and gambling have come together in recent years, young people are unable to differentiate between gambling and sport, and that is so very tragic. We've recently seen some of our headline sports stars come out in the media and talk about how they have received death threats because they didn't perhaps play as well as they should have and how people have lost money on their performance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While this government has acted to restrict live sport betting, much to its credit, there's still a lot of work to be done. While I have breath in my lungs, I can assure you, I will be continuing to press this government to act further. We've got to stop the craziness in this country, where people are spending $25 billion on gambling. That is the equivalent of six or seven brand new public hospitals that could be invested in by a government. It is $25 billion which is being lost by families, some of whom are unable to put food on the table or pay the rent. These gambling companies are raking in billions of dollars, whilst Australians can't pay the bills. This is something we've got to do. This is something I'll continue to press this government to do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  The wine region of Langhorne Creek sits on the rich soil of a flood plain in a cool-climate region, resulting in high-quality grapes that produce many sought-after varietals. Langhorne Creek, in my electorate, is approximately 6,000 hectares in size, making it the second largest wine region in South Australia. I'm going to talk about just a couple of wineries at Langhorne Creek that have recently held special events, one being Bremerton Wines. It was established in 1988, when the Wilson family produced their first wine grapes from a neighbour's grapes. They planted their own grapes in 1991 and opened their cellar door in 1994. Today sisters Lucy and Rebecca run their family business and have just unveiled a new cellar door and tasting room in a beautifully converted, rustic barn featuring recycled materials from all across South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I attended the opening of the Barrel Room at Lake Breeze winery. Lake Breeze is a fine example of a thriving family business, with generations of the Follett family working together side by side. It's lovely to see a family—many generations—working with each other, deeply respectful and with a great love for each other. Lake Breeze first produced their wine in 1987 and opened a cellar door in 1991. The Barrel Room is a contemporary function space and has views across the vineyard. I'd encourage anyone to come and visit Langhorne Creek in my electorate. You won't be disappointed. It's a beautiful place to be.</span>

Therefore, I'd like to take this opportunity to update the House on the published studies on this so-called snake oil remedy. At last count there were 39 published studies conducted by 275 scientists with 11,371 patients. These include 20 randomised, controlled trials. Of these trials, 10 are prophylaxis trials, which on average show a 90 per cent reduction of COVID infections. The latest study, a double-blind placebo controlled study by the Israeli professor Eli Schwartz, found that ivermectin could shorten the viral shedding period.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of these 39 studies, 100 per cent have found ivermectin to have a positive effect. So, the probability of an ineffective treatment or a mere 'snake oil', as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times </span>calls it—to get 39 out of 39—is actually one in 550 billion. That's right: one in  550 billion. I call on our national COVID evidence group to again look at the evidence. They've looked at only seven studies. They have looked at less than 10 per cent of the evidence. They've got to get on and look at all the evidence and make sensible recommendations based upon the science.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  Today we were confronted with yet another shocking revelation of alleged sexual harassment within this building. I do not use the word 'shocked', because, sadly, I'm not. My heart goes out to the young woman, Brittany Higgins, who came forward with her story. But how many times do we have to be confronted by headlines before anything's done? How many times do we have to listen to those opposite use sanitised language, such as 'extremely distressing', before systematic change is enacted? Why is it that time and time again it takes a brave and often young woman to put herself in the firing line of public opinion, to put her job on the line, before parliament discusses this issue and we review behaviours, guidelines and governance?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every person who comes to Parliament House has the right to a safe workplace and positive culture. This is not the first time a victim has come forward, and we have the chance for it to be the last. On days like this I think of my two young daughters, who are about to enter the workforce. They, like all women, deserve to be treated with dignity, with respect and without fear of reprisal when they need to speak up. We have let so many women before Brittany down. Every day that we go without systemic and cultural change we let others down, too. Let's work together and make change so that women can be comfortable, safe and secure in this place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  In the shadow of the Australia Day atrocity in my electorate, my city of Redland came together to seek solutions to youth justice and ice addiction. Recognising that Queensland has double the mainland state average for violent related crimes and triple the mainland Australia average for vehicle related crimes, there is a need to take particular action in my state of Queensland. I want to thank Mr Mick Bloye and his wife, Ronnie, for getting together at the Alex Hills AFL club to make sure we had a forum and a venue to make this possible. Last Friday night 120 locals met to discuss these issues with the support of elected members from all three levels of government and the following organisations: Redlands Local Drug Action Team, youth ambassadors from across Redlands, Love and Hope Redlands, Youth YOU Program, police and ex-police officers, Traction youth program, Australian Drug Foundation, Queensland Injectors Health Network, The Cage Youth Foundation, Sarina Russo, Redlands Coast Chamber of Commerce, Australian Industry Trade College and their students, Alcolizer Technology Cleveland—which is engaged in making illicit drug testing systems in my electorate—Redlands Psychologists, headspace, Metro South Primary Health Network, Queensland Network of Alcohol and Drug Agencies, legal practitioners from across Redlands and Redlands sporting clubs as well as the parents of the many youth that were of key voice in the first third of this forum.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  Across the world, 171 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have now been delivered, including 50 million in the US, 15 million in the UK, five million in Brazil, and two million in Indonesia. Israel has delivered 72 doses per 100 people. The Prime Minister said that Australia would be 'at the front of the queue', and the health minister said that vaccination would be 'commencing in January'. But the fact is that Australia didn't strike our first vaccine deal until September 2020, six months after other nations had lined up vaccine supply for their citizens.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delayed vaccine rollout in Australia isn't just a health issue; it's an economic issue too. Last May the Treasurer said that the lockdown of the economy was costing $4 billion a week. Tardy vaccine rollout doesn't have quite the same cost to the economy as a lockdown but must nonetheless have a massive economic impact. We cannot recover the economy in sectors like international tourism and in-person services until Australia has a high rate of vaccination. Yet the tardiness of the Morrison government has been costing Australia in health terms and in economic terms. They promised that they would be as swift as an eagle. In fact, when it comes to vaccination, they have been as slow as a turkey.</span>

Bruce Linton, of the Kenthurst brigade, recently reminded me about Lionel Smith, who has now given 75 years of his life to the RFS and has served with significant distinction. This makes him one of the longest-serving RFS members in the Hills District, if not in New South Wales.</span>

Throughout his illustrious career, Lionel has held the ranks of deputy captain, group captain, deputy fire control officer and fire control officer in the Hills District. Lionel served the community on the Bushfire Council of New South Wales, as a member of the technical committee and radio subcommittee as a technical officer. He was the former chairman of the Fire Control Officers Association of New South Wales. He also developed the foam proportioning system now used on all New South Wales RFS appliances. For his services to the RFS he has achieved the Australian Fire Service medal in 1960, the National Medal, first and second class, and he has received long service awards for 35, 50, 60 and 70 years of service.</span>

Recently, two of our most important regional partners, India and Myanmar, have experienced significant turbulence. Since November, thousands of Indian farmers have protested proposed agricultural laws. These protests have triggered concerns and anxiety amongst many of my constituents in Darwin and Palmerston, who worry about violence and destabilisation. Our relationship with India is extremely important. That importance continues to grow, yet it's a relationship that those opposite, the Morrison government, continue to neglect. The excellent Varghese report on building stronger trade links with India is just sitting on a shelf collecting dust. We need to do much better than that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent military coup in Myanmar has also been deeply troubling. It represents a dramatic retreat that country has been making from democracy. Yesterday, in my electorate in Darwin, I joined the Myanmar community at a rally to condemn the coup. The voice of the people in Myanmar must be respected and it must be heard. I call on those opposite, the government, to immediately take all steps to work with our international partners to reverse this coup. In both India and Myanmar, the rights of their citizens to be free and to peacefully protest must be respected and enabled.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  Today, I would like to acknowledge someone who has gone above and beyond for our Chisholm community. When James Nicolas walked into the Blackburn Football Club in 2016, he fell in love with the place and was taken aback by the spirit and dedication of its volunteers. So, naturally, he decided to write the club's history. This was a real labour of love. James has devoted literally thousands of hours to his research. He has studied more than 117 years of local and state records, as well as club annual reports, and interviewed hundreds of past players and club members, but it has all been worth it. The result of his work, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mighty Fighting Burns: The History of the Blackburn Football Club</span>, will be an incredible resource not only for local football fans but also as a history of the Blackburn area. It also happens to be a great read. Last week, I was thrilled to present James with a Chisholm community award to recognise and celebrate his incredible contribution to local football and our community. Congratulations, James, and thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  Gong xi fa cai to all who are celebrating the Lunar New Year, welcoming the Year of the Ox and bidding farewell to the Year of the Rat. I think that, after 2020, we can all say, 'Good riddance.' It was during the Lunar New Year in 2020 that people returning from visiting family overseas started to self-isolate, even before the rest of Australia understood this necessity. In 2020, events were cancelled and wearing masks around my electorate, in Sunnybank particularly, became the norm. Here we are, 12 months on, and communities have still managed to celebrate the good fortune we have locally. Sunnybank Plaza held its cultural stalls, Sunnybank Hills had a lovely lamp display, and at Market Square on Friday I saw lion dancing, bringing fortune and chasing away some evil spirits. You might have guessed that the Year of the Rat is traditionally a year of turbulence, in which change and disasters are commonplace, and certainly last year lived up to that name. However, this year, 2021, the ox is seen as a hard worker, and zodiac experts, whom I've consulted extensively for this, believe the Year of the Ox is a period when hard work will be rewarded, even more than usual. Let me tell you that we have all been working hard at saying goodbye to the Year of the Rat and welcoming the Year of the Ox. To all those celebrating, I wish you good fortune in the Year of the Ox. Xin nian kuai le! I thank the member for Chisholm for the pronunciation tip. Gong xi fa cai!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  It's always an enormous privilege to speak about the wonderful members of my local northern Tasmanian community, particularly when I've had the opportunity to meet them in person. I was fortunate enough to meet Patrick Rosevear in late 2019 when he was nominated for an achievement award for his work with rural youth. Living on a farm myself, I was immediately impressed with Patrick's passion for farming and agriculture. Recently, Patrick was named as a local winner of the ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">Heywire</span> competition, telling the story of his love for the land and farming. It was particularly wonderful to read of Patrick's love for his parents and the role they have played in ensuring that Patrick, who was diagnosed with autism at four years of age, had all the opportunities to fulfil his dreams.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Patrick, who hails from multiple generations of sheep and livestock farmers, is currently studying for a certificate III in agriculture and has a work placement at the Powranna Sale Yards, south of Launceston. As Patrick told <span style="font-style:italic;">Heywire</span>: 'My perfect day would be bringing the sheep from their overnight pens, pushing them up through the draft, where they get separated and penned into the saleyards, then putting all the cards onto the fence for the auctioneer to read. Noise can be an issue for me; I hate sirens. But when you're busy working you don't notice the sounds and they're there for a reason.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Patrick, it's clear to anyone who has met you that farming is your passion. You're well on your way to achieving your dreams and I wish you every luck for your future.</span>

From Lawson to Mount Victoria, parts of Pitt Town, Wilberforce and all of McGraths Hill, people are stuck with the antiquated, copper-heavy FTTN. In a relay, you're only as fast as your slowest runner, and with the NBN you're only as fast as your slowest technology. Copper is the tortoise of the race.

It's one of the ways that this active octogenarian stays connected and agile. When I visited, <span style="font-style:italic;">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</span> was taking hours to download. But, while he's technologically savvy and can push through the appalling FTTN, he knows that too many of his friends just give up. It shouldn't be this hard, and fibre to the home would have avoided all of that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  The St Mary's Convent Football Club is a passionate and enthusiastic team oriented club. Last week, it was a delight to join the under 13s and under 11s at training on the Myrtle Road playing fields under brand-new lights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Community Development Grants we delivered almost $86,000 to install floodlights over the playing fields, as well as upgrading the surface. Phil, the club secretary, said that this upgrade has made the field 100 per cent better than what it used to be. For the St Mary's Convent Football Club, local cricket clubs and local schools these upgrades enhance safety and open more opportunities for training and competitions at night. Our local sports clubs are such an integral part of our community and play an important role in helping our kids stay healthy and active—something I'm passionate about—to make new friends and to learn lifelong skills. Sharon, the club president, told me how the club had overcome challenges and retained almost all of its players throughout the coronavirus pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also visited the Kingsway Sports Precinct, where joint federal and council investment has delivered floodlighting to allow thousands of players to play safely at night. I would also like to congratulate the clubs there, particularly the touch football and Oztag teams which have volunteered to ensure that our community, players and spectators have kept safe during the coronavirus pandemic. You have all done such a tremendous job.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  Ten years ago a man in my electorate called John Brown wanted to open a place where men could go to relax, to rub shoulders and to exchange banter—a place to get out of the house and maybe have some company with fellow mates. At the age of 82, John established the Oxley Men's Shed. He came to my office when I was the local councillor and said, 'Let's make this happen.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a lifelong handyman, he has built a great many things. But the most important thing that he's created is a safe place that provides a shoulder to lean on for men in our community. These are men who have lost their partners or who are struggling with their mental health, or maybe there are those who only have months to live and want to do something meaningful with their final days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, at the age of 92, John stepped down and handed over the presidency at the AGM, which I attended. I know that he will continue to make a legacy in community outreach within schools and kindergartens, and now in supporting the 35 men who find solace in the shed. John says that he has done a lot of things which have brought him satisfaction through his long life, but heading the men's shed has been the most satisfying of all. He told me: 'I've been able to help so many people, especially people with depression. They've come through it beautifully.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John has pledged to continue his work at the shed, and although he is looking forward to a well-earned holiday I know he'll be back and turning up to St John's church each week. It's been a privilege to support John's hard work; he's a true local hero. Congratulations, mate, and I look forward to many cuppas in the years ahead.</span>

It was built using a lego-style construction with 40 tonnes of Australian steel, more than 210 cubic metres of concrete, 140 tonnes of asphalt and 32 concrete wall panel and deck units. This state-of-the-art bridge will be used by more than 12,000 vehicles every day, improving Noosa's road network and boosting the movement of freight. It's got a 166-tonne rating and a lifespan of 100 years, which means it'll cater to Noosa's traffic needs for generations to come. Importantly, the project generated more than 50 local jobs, involving 34 suppliers, creating much-needed jobs as we recover from COVID-19. It was funded with a fifty-fifty split between the coalition government's Bridges Renewal Program and Noosa Shire Council. The unique design and construction helped keep costs much lower than originally budgeted, slashing nearly $3 million from the initial projected $6.3 million. That's a big win for Noosa ratepayers and a big saving for Australian taxpayers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  Australia is speeding towards the JobKeeper cliff: that moment at the end of March when this government cuts JobKeeper to zero. For some sectors—tourism, for example—it is not going to be a soft landing. A recent national survey of travel agents found that just one in 10 believe they will survive the JobKeeper cliff without urgent intervention. That's 40,000 jobs lost.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One business in my area—Helloworld in Carlingford—has been talking to me about just this problem. The owner, Angie, has seen a lot in her 40 years as a travel agent. Her business has survived disruptions like SARS, the GFC, terrorism and the Ansett collapse, but nothing compares to COVID. Since the border closed almost a year ago, Angie and her staff have been working tirelessly to secure refunds for their customers. It's cost her $60,000 to keep her business running so she can provide refunds to customers, with no business coming in. Agents like Angie have been crying out for help for months. It took the Morrison government until December to announce tailored support for the industry in the form of $128 million in one-off cash grants. But the scheme is so poorly designed that, because of the way they report turnover, the majority of travel agents, including Angie, received no support. Because of timing and the way her business is structured, Angie also missed out on the lost carry-back measures in the budget.</span>

But such a local response requires local leadership, and I want to pay tribute today to school principals, who play an instrumental role in ensuring local resilience through this pandemic. Last week I visited a few schools and saw these principals in action.</span>

I'm talking about Greg Myers at Good Samaritan Catholic College and Anthony Ryan at Coolum State School. These are principals who are showing leadership not just in their schools but, indeed, in their local communities. It's due to local community leadership that we are seeing every little pocket, certainly in my seat of Fairfax, respond to this pandemic with strength and with unity. I thank them and I encourage them to continue to provide this local leadership until we're through the other side of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  In the short time available to me I speak again today about the plight of travel agents as we head towards 31 March. Travel agents talk about their plight better than any politician can. Tina from the Latrobe Valley says: 'A 29-year-old business. Credits owed to customers. Refunds being chased. People facing retrenchment. The value of the business smashed to nothing.' They need help. Neil on the Sunshine Coast says he just wants an extension of JobKeeper until international borders are raised, perhaps a better retail guarantee from landlords and the sorting out of the additional grants scheme, which has been poorly administered by the tax office and Austrade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Angie, from north-west Sydney, reports on the difficulties they're going to have in being able to chase refunds if JobKeeper is not extended past 31 March, and I thank them. Dave from Nerang has been working 13 hours a day, seven days a week chasing up people. He faces bankruptcy. He's had to spend his super. He says, 'The government's travel agents support package hasn't delivered what was promised and needs to be redesigned.' And Melanie, from Brisbane, has a small family-owned business. To the best of her ability she's chased money for her clients for the last 12 months. There's still money outstanding. If the travel agents aren't there to help the passengers and the tourists, the money won't be recovered. We also need Tourism Australia to do more to promote using local travel agents rather than international travel platforms.</span>

Are other banks to follow? Just watch this space. We cannot afford to have this spread to Gladstone and other ports in Queensland and across Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">ANZ last year released the most ambitious zero net emissions action plan of the big four banks by imposing low carbon deadlines for the agriculture, energy and transport sectors. The value of our coal exports in December rose by 26 per cent from November, with coal worth $3.7 billion to the economy in December alone. This is going to show that coal is still a vital player in our economy. As we shift nearer to net zero emissions by 2050 we need to make sure we get the balance correct. Did I hear the bank say they were going to finance the importation of solar panels from China or wind turbines from Germany? I'm calling on the banks to get real and support our regional jobs and industry.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  No doubt 2020 was a difficult year for all of us, but for some people it was perhaps the most devastating year of their lives. In March last year Dylan Briggs, a year 9 student from Frankston High School, was riding his bike home. He was hit just a few hundred metres from his home, and died in hospital five days later. I can't comprehend, and I don't know how many people can comprehend, the unspeakable grief for Dylan's family. This tragedy was felt by his friends, by his school and by the wider Frankston community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dylan's classmates stepped up. They wanted to celebrate Dylan and share his story in a meaningful way. They've created the Chill Out &amp; Look About campaign. It's an initiative which aims to improve road safety and awareness for all road users, and I encourage everyone to find it on their Facebook page and their website. It's an amazing initiative, and the very worthy winner of Frankston council's Community Event of the Year at the council's Australia Day ceremony. Kai Malcolm was the Young Citizen of the Year. I want to congratulate Kai and his classmates and everyone from the school, particularly Sarah Bahramis, his teacher. I give my condolences to Dylan's family, particularly his mum Sarah-Jane. As she said, Dylan's lasting legacy was that he was an organ donor. He saved the life of a mother, a young boy and many others.</span>

Matriarchs and the importance of matriarchies are sometimes underestimated. Bub was a matriarch in the truest sense of the word, not just to her family but also to her broader family, the community of Mount Gambier. She was mayoress for 19 years, between 1983 and 2002, the point at which we experienced the untimely death of her husband, Don. She made an impact across the community, but, beyond that, she was a loving and devoted mother and mother-in-law to Frank and Kay, Judy and Robert, Fay and Johnny, Michael and Susan, Brian and Tracey, John and Virginia, Helen and Robert. She had an amazing 23 grandchildren and a herculean 43 great-grandchildren. I have had the benefit of reading the eulogies that were read and prepared by her grandsons, Nick O'Connor and Joseph Contin. They speak of the deep warmth that 'Bub' had for her family and for her community. 'Bub' is someone we should all strive to be—a pillar of the community, and a person who lived her strong family values and was devoted to the community that she made better for her presence in it.</span>

When we consider the range of scientific challenges before us, from pandemics to climate and energy, from plastic waste to biodiversity conservation, we must recognise that our efforts are weaker than they could be simply because the participation of women is skewed low rather than being equal. Efforts have been made to encourage and support women and girls in science, yet globally only 30 per cent choose science related fields. Of all science researchers, less than 30 per cent are women. In Australia it's welcome that half of all PhD science graduates today are women, but at the same time women make up only 17 per cent of senior academics in our research institutes and universities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Thursday I met with Natalie Elliott, who studied science at the University of Western Australia and now applies her skills and expertise in managing park services on Rottnest Island. For Natalie the lightbulb moment was a story her mum told her, of the rediscovery of Gilbert's potoroo in Albany in the mid-1990s. The potoroo was thought to have been extinct. It remains Australia's most endangered marsupial. That reality, and the challenge and prospect of making a difference, led Natalie to study science—a decision that she says has carried her towards worthwhile life's work. I'm sure that's true.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  The Morrison government is committed to supporting Australian agriculture, which of course includes aquaculture and forestry, to achieve its ambitious goal of $100 billion in farmgate sales and output by 2030. It's important for our nature and for our ongoing food security and economic recovery.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Already, unmet demand in agriculture is significant. Recent figures indicate that there are five jobs for every graduate in agriculture. This is why I fully support the federal government's decision to reduce the out-of-pocket costs for students studying a degree in agriculture by 62 per cent. It has meant that young people are investigating this pathway for the first time and asking the question, 'Could agriculture be for me?' The answer is, of course, yes. Enrolments in the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture's science degree have almost doubled this year—good news for agriculture.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are smart, well-paid jobs that offer an exciting career path that could take you anywhere over the nation or throughout the world. Today's agriculture is about drones, robots, cutting-edge AI, GPS systems, problem solving and research. Skills in agriculture, maths, teaching, nursing, clinical psychology, English and languages, science, health, architecture, environmental studies, IT and engineering are all in demand, and it's because of the federal government and its increased public contribution made to these courses, making these courses more affordable than ever before. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee recommends that Working Holiday (subclass 417) and Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa holders should be able to work in tourism and hospitality in all hard-to-staff rural and remote areas of Australia as part of their 88 days or 6 months to qualify for their second- or third- year WHM visa.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the committee for that recommendation. It was in response to a submission that I put in on behalf of those members that represent inland Australia—remote and very remote Australia:  basically draw a line around the middle. We're finding it's very difficult to get workers in hospitality everywhere in Australia at the moment, it must be said, and that plays into a larger debate. But this has been an ongoing issue for places in my electorate like Oodnadatta, Marree, the Flinders Ranges and Coober Pedy, which actually revolves around tourism but can't get workers. They've been competing against the agricultural and mining industries where, of course, the 417 visa holiday-makers could get the extension. It has been recognised previously that they face these issues above the Tropic of Capricorn, so I've asked for a continuation of that. I met with the minister a week ago and he seemed very open to moving in this space and I just ask that that is exactly what happens.</span>

I'm also pleased to say that RAAF Base Williamtown provides fantastic employment and a lifestyle that many defence families say is the envy of the defence community. I want to congratulate Group Captain Anthony Stainton. Good on you, George, you are doing a fantastic job as the new SADFO. I often joke that I am the self-appointed member for the F-35. We know that we have 54 of the 72 F-35s based at Australia's premium jet base in the country.</span>

Last week I was pleased to visit Fighter World and meet up with Bernie Nebenfuhr and Air Vice-Marshal (Ret'd) John Quaife, who showed me around Fighter World. It displays aircraft, uniforms, memorabilia, but most importantly it provides a place for our students to go and do the most incredible workshops. They talk about aviation and being part of the modern Defence Force in Australia. Congratulations and happy birthday.</span>

It provides proximity to realities that we cannot easily grasp ourselves. Last month I visited the Sydney Jewish Museum with the New South Wales Treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, where survivors have been doing the important work of educating thousands on the horrors of the Holocaust, for over 28 years, ensuring that we never forget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many grow older, the museum is now using cutting-edge technology to immortalise the stories in hologram form. The Dimensions in Testimony project is creating interactive biographies with six holocaust survivors. Each survivor is asked literally 1,000 questions and their interviews are filmed in 360 degrees by 23 cameras. The result will be a 3D interactive image, like a hologram, where visitors can ask questions and the virtual survivor will respond in real time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During our visit the Treasurer and I had the privilege of meeting survivors Eddie Jaku and Jack Meister, and I would like to thank them. I would like to thank Olga Horak, Kuba Enoch, Yvonne Engelman, Paul Drexler and Francine Lazarus for sharing their stories of survival and giving their time to ensure that we never forget the Holocaust and that we always remember the tragedy and the horror. I commend the Sydney Jewish Museum for this innovative program, which will continue to give a voice to survivors and inspire change. I want to thank Gus Lehrer, the president of the board; Norman Seligman, the CEO; and Greg and Cathy Shand, both board members.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  This last year might be remembered for many reasons, but I think it should be renamed the 'Year of the Volunteer'. Last year our community was hit with drought, bushfire, flood and a pandemic. We have never needed our volunteers more. Time and time again, we have seen our volunteers step up when they were needed most, supporting local people who were having the hardest year of their lives. I want to sincerely thank all our local volunteers for everything they have done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last round of volunteer grants at the start of last year, I had an absolutely overwhelming response, with over 74 expressions of interest from local organisations. At the time I requested the minister make further funds available for our hardworking volunteers. I was delighted to see those funds being made available through the Supplementary Volunteer Grants program, and now 12 local volunteer groups in my electorate will share in more than $41,000 as part of this program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to congratulate all of the local recipients: the Bay and Basin Cancer Support Group, Community Life Batemans Bay, Eurobodalla Meals on Wheels, Gerringong football club, the Kiama Show Society, Kiama Woodcraft Group, the Lions Club of Batemans Bay, the Rotary Club of Kiama, the Rotary Club of Nowra, the Shoalhaven Historical Society, Shoalhaven Neighbourhood Services, and the Lions Club of Jervis Bay. Well done, and thank you for all your work over the last year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  I went to the last election promising to fix local roads in Ryan, and I'm very pleased to report that the latest project is underway to do just that. Early works have begun in Ashgrove to replace the Gresham Street bridge. Councillor Steven Toomey and I visited the site last week to inspect the work and to speak with the tradies who are already on the ground. This has been a long-awaited project for local residents, particularly those in St Johns Wood, and I appreciate their patience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been federal funding, combined with funding from the Brisbane City Council, that has seen this project finally commence. The bridge was built in 1931 and is now nearing the end of its serviceable life. The new Gresham Street bridge will have increased vehicle weight limits and improved flood resistance—important over the creek—and will provide a wider footpath for pedestrian safety, which is particularly important because it is en route to a local school. Along with improving our local roads, this project, importantly, is creating jobs in the Ryan electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is about committing funding to shovel-ready projects to get our economy firing again, and Gresham Street bridge project, to be completed in 2022, is just one example of that. It's also a fantastic example of how LNP governments, at both the council and the federal level, are working together to get long-awaited projects moving. It is because of the federal funding and the funding from the Brisbane City Council that this project has now been delivered for local residents. We are fixing local roads.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  I rise to acknowledge the local businesses in my electorate who are facing probably the toughest challenge of their time in business. They, of course, are the travel agents. I, along with Senator Farrell, our shadow minister, met with over 40 travel agents locally in Macnamara last week and with the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, and we listened. We listened to their experiences. We listened to the feedback the travel agents were giving us. Most importantly, we listened to the feedback around the level of government support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this pandemic is not over. Many travel agents don't receive most of their income from domestic travel. Most travel agents traditionally receive their income from international travel, from hotel stays and from some of the package deals they so amazingly put together. They are hardworking businesses and hardworking Australians. It's clear from the feedback we are receiving from our local travel agents that without JobKeeper they will be finished and jobs will go, and that without a return to open international borders their business model isn't sustainable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This pandemic isn't over. We're asking businesses like travel agents to make significant changes to the way in which they do business in Australia. We have a choice: we can let them fold and let jobs go, or we can do what we've done so far and provide JobKeeper, provide support for businesses and provide support for the Australian workers who add so much to the Australian economy. The government shouldn't be pulling JobKeeper. They should be supporting Australian businesses like our travel agents.</span>

Isobel lives just outside of my electorate of Sturt in Adelaide. I know her whole family very, very well. They're great philanthropic contributors to so many worthwhile causes in South Australia. But what she has done is truly inspirational. Isobel, with a friend from school, established a charity called TABOO. They produce women's sanitary products and sell them, and the profit they make through that process they invest in providing those same products into disadvantaged communities, both overseas and here in Australia. That's in Africa, in particular, Uganda and Sierra Leone, but also in remote Indigenous communities in Australia. </span>

You're hardly renowned for having much spare time when you're studying medicine, but what she has achieved already is extremely inspirational. She is only at the beginning of what she intends to achieve through that initiative, but I'm so proud of her and so proud that she was recognised by her country for what she has achieved. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the pandemic hit, Labor was quick to call on the government to follow the lead of other countries and put in place a wage subsidy program that would save jobs. According to Treasury, JobKeeper has saved some 700,000 jobs since it was put into place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But with unprecedented spending, unprecedented scrutiny should be required. It is not good enough that the government treats JobKeeper money like it is Liberal Party money and refuses to provide appropriate accountability to the Australian people for some of the reasonable concerns about JobKeeper. One of those is that firms have taken JobKeeper and used it to pay executive bonuses. The firms that have done this include Accent Group, IDP Education, Star Entertainment Group, Lendlease and Premier Investments. The practice has been criticised by Jeremy Hirschhorn from the Australia Taxation Office; by Jeff Kennett, the former Liberal Premier; and by Jennifer Westacott, the head of the Business Council of Australia. All of them recognise that it is not appropriate, if you are receiving taxpayer subsidies, to be paying your multimillion dollar CEOs additional bonuses—in the case of Premier Investments, a bonus of $2.5 million, more than most Australians will earn in a lifetime, paid out in a single bonus to a firm receiving JobKeeper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet, extraordinarily, we haven't heard a word from the government on this issue. It has only been Labor that has been critical of firms paying executive bonuses. When I pointed out that firms that were receiving JobKeeper appeared to have seen their profits rise, the Prime Minister said I was engaging in the politics of envy. Prime Minister, this is not the politics of envy: this is the politics of fairness, the politics of decency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some firms have done the right thing. I'd give three cheers to Toyota Australia, Super Retail Group, Domino's and Iluka, and 1.5 cheers to Nick Scali, who have paid back half of the JobKeeper they have received. Yet other firms have failed to follow suit. It is ironic that at a time when debt is going to $1 trillion, it is Labor that's publicly calling on firms whose profits rose while receiving JobKeeper to pay the money back. You would imagine the Treasurer might be part of that call, but he is missing in action. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we saw another firm report increased profits. Seven West Media, whose largest shareholder is Kerry Stokes, reported an underlying profit up 25 per cent, having received around $35 million in JobKeeper. I called on the Treasurer to ask the House Economics Committee to initiate an inquiry into the extent to which JobKeeper went to firms that then became more profitable. I'm yet to receive a response to that letter to the Treasurer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the hypocrisy from the Treasurer in the drip feed of information about certain aspects of the JobKeeper program. He is in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> today, on page 11, providing a breakdown of JobKeeper numbers by time, region and industry. Yet he won't disclose some of the issues that have been raised by sensible critics about the JobKeeper program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Taxation Office now has four business activity statements and one income tax return for every business that received JobKeeper. The tax office must disclose the actual experience of businesses over this time, in aggregate. We're not asking for the details of every small business to be made transparent. But for businesses with a turnover of $1 billion that forecast a 50 per cent turnover drop from March to June 2020, the Australian public have a right to know how much JobKeeper went to those that did not experience that forecast drop in turnover. For businesses with a turnover below $1 billion that forecast a 30 per cent drop, how much JobKeeper went to those that did not in fact experience such a drop? How much JobKeeper has gone to firms that have paid executive bonuses? How much JobKeeper has gone to firms that paid out stonking dividends to billionaire shareholders?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282981" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  Well, Labor really are struggling to be relevant as an opposition at the moment, and that's never clearer than when they talk about JobKeeper. In fact, they love to say it was their idea—when it suits them, of course. The truth is that on the other side of the House they are huge fans of JobKeeper, because Australians are big fans of JobKeeper. As Labor members talk to their constituents, they are having conversations about JobKeeper that are very similar to the ones government members on this side of the chamber are having.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">JobKeeper was fast, it was effective and it was very welcome, particularly in my electorate of Moncrieff. It was understood to be a temporary measure because of its huge scale and the risks to the economy of prolonging it, and those on the other side know that. Only last week, when the Minister for Tourism, Trade and Investment joined me in Moncrieff, on the Gold Coast, the conversations with local tourism operators reflected that reality: that business operators indeed accept that the government must adjust its economic measures as the situation evolves, and they said so loudly. Every one of them thanked the government for their JobKeeper lifeline. It's commendable that the member for Fenner is making an effort to be constructive on JobKeeper—and I note that he's now left the chamber. However, no program of this scale—rapidly implemented, as was necessary—could have achieved perfection. I'm also not sure that he'll achieve very much from this temporary measure when the real issue is: what is our next changing economic circumstance, and will we manage it?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear on some points. JobKeeper was always a temporary program that needed to taper off with the improvement of our economy, for two very good reasons: (1) not to jeopardise the very recovery it's designed to bridge and (2) because it would be irresponsible not to limit the program to its necessary levels, given the potential debt burden for the next generation. I note that those on the other side grin. They grin in agreeance, of course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence that the recovery is underway is very clear, with over 785 jobs created over the past seven months. Fewer businesses and their employees are in need of JobKeeper and other temporary economic support. On the Gold Coast there has been a 59 per cent reduction in the number of people on JobKeeper—in one of the worst-affected regions. This job creation over the past seven months means that fewer businesses and their employees are in need of JobKeeper and other temporary economic supports. The Treasurer has always been clear on this issue. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Based on what we know today, there should be no expectation that JobKeeper will extend beyond the end of March. It was always a temporary program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Moncrieff, the government's other stimulus measures have also been very effective in protecting jobs, keeping businesses in business and of course keeping those doors open—absolutely. Over $200 million in personal income taxes has gone into Moncrieff. There have been business investment incentives, the JobMaker Hiring Credit and the HomeBuilder program, and they've all assisted the local economy. In fact, I think there was around $28 billion in support from the federal government to the Gold Coast alone across the five electorates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has delivered the tremendous support that Australians have needed: $267 billion in direct economic and health support. Of the $251 billion in direct economic support, around $148 billion has already flowed to Australian households and businesses. The JobKeeper payment has provided $83 billion of support to businesses and their employees since the start of the pandemic to date. This has kept businesses in business and Australians in those all-important jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear in Moncrieff and at the national level that the economic circumstances of families and businesses vary quite dramatically, depending on industry, location, business model and exposure to ongoing uncertainties like state government border closures. That's why I'm very focused, now and in the future, on the government tailoring further measures as required. In Broadbeach in the last week we had one of the Gold Coast's largest employers, Atlas Staff, hosting a round table with the Minister for Trade and Tourism with stakeholders from the tourism and events industry, and local ministers Andrews and Robert. I organised the round table because the Minister for Trade and Tourism knows, as I do, that supporting an industry starts with listening to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainty and confidence were the two main points that came out of that round table—certainty and confidence. That means better management of outbreaks by state governments and more stability on border conditions. That means tourists are able to move freely, with confidence, between states. That's what we need in Moncrieff and that's what we need on the Gold Coast.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  When you're a government, you make mistakes—especially in a crisis, including in a pandemic. You bring in policies that might not have had every detail thought through. You spend a lot of money and, in hindsight, you may have done things differently. That's forgivable, although you wouldn't have thought so if you had heard the Abbott opposition and subsequent Liberals carrying on a treat during and after the global financial crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But on this side, we are a responsible opposition which puts the interests of the country ahead of political pointscoring. During COVID we've been extraordinarily focused on being constructive rather than combative. We did the right thing. But we won't sit back and watch the Morrison government patting itself on the back for adopting our idea and the union movement's idea of wage support, or fail to call out the behaviour of big businesses which have pocketed JobKeeper payments when they didn't need them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">JobKeeper is the most expensive one-off program ever implemented by an Australian government. The estimate is that it will cost around $100 billion. We've supported the existence of the scheme and, in fact, we're calling for it to be maintained for businesses which have not yet recovered, and that's to protect jobs. But there are big businesses which have taken advantage of the scheme to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. These big listed companies have literally pocketed the JobKeeper funds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Premier Investments, the owner of Smiggle, Just Jeans and Portmans, made a bigger profit last year than it did in 2019. It paid shareholders $57 million in dividends, and Solomon Lew received more than $20 million of that. It also paid its chief executive, Mark McInnes, a $2.5 million bonus, taking his total pay to more than $5 million. That's not bad during a pandemic. So how much JobKeeper did Premier Investments receive? It was $40 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some big businesses which found that times weren't as tough as they expected have done the right thing—not Premier but some others. Nick Scali is an example; it has handed back most of its JobKeeper—$3.6 million. Hopefully, they'll hand it all back but what they've done is a start. Toyota returned $18 million and the owner of Rebel and BCF is repaying $1.7 million. Domino's has paid back JobKeeper. Platypus and Hype DC owner, Accent Group, took $14 million of JobKeeper funds but it hasn't paid any back. Instead, it paid a bonus of $1.2 million to its head and $50 million in dividends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After 25 years of working in the listed corporate world my experience is that while big businesses will sometimes do the right thing out of a sense of social responsibility, mostly governments need to mandate it. That's the bit I don't get from the Morrison government. It had no hesitation in hounding welfare recipients that it had overpaid. It sent them threatening letters as part of the robodebt witch-hunt, yet the Prime Minister won't support the call from the Business Council of Australia, from the former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett, from the Australian tax office and from us, Labor, who are critical of firms hanging on to JobKeeper at the same time as paying themselves huge bonuses, big dividends and making big profits. It is forgivable to make mistakes, but it is unforgiveable not to learn from and correct those mistakes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The university sector was told repeatedly last year that it did not deserve JobKeeper. Hardworking academics in my electorate are being told that overpaying big business is more important to this government than the work that they do. Most people working in the arts and entertainment industry were excluded from JobKeeper. Local government employees were excluded. Casuals of fewer than 12 months service were excluded from JobKeeper payments. People on temporary protection visas and international students all missed out. Small businesses in my electorate were left out. Where two people were in a partnership, only one person was eligible for JobKeeper, yet many big businesses raked it in. That shows you whose side this Morrison government is on. It shows you not with their words but with their actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been a 50 per cent increase in the average wealth of Aussie billionaires in the last year, yet regions like the Upper Blue Mountains, where international tourism is crucial for local jobs, are about to lose the one thing that has helped them keep some staff employed some of the time and allowed their businesses to keep their heads above water. The Prime Minister and Treasurer need to come clean on their mistake. They need to tell us how much JobKeeper support was paid to firms who had an increase in profit, paid executive bonuses and paid huge dividends. It's absolutely clear whose side this Morrison government is on.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282986" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  COVID-19 has resulted in the most severe global economic crisis since the Great Depression. Across the world, the equivalent of 600 million people have tragically lost their jobs. The global economy is expected to have contracted by four per cent compared to just 0.1 per cent during the global financial crisis. Australia has not been immune to this crisis. In April 2020, more than one million Australians lost their jobs or saw their working hours reduced to zero and the economy entered into recession for the first time in nearly 30 years. However, Australia's economy is now fighting back. In the September 2020 quarter, real GDP increased by 3.3 per cent, well ahead of market expectations and our international counterparts. From May to December last year, over 784,000 jobs were created. Ninety per cent of the 1.3 million Australians who either lost their jobs or saw their working hours reduced to zero are now back at work. That said, while Australia's recession may be over, it is important to note that our economic recovery is not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One key source of support thus far throughout these challenging times has been the JobKeeper program. It's on the lips of every working Australian. We know it has helped keep businesses in business, it's helped keep workers at work and it's helped families keep food on the table. I'm grateful to the member for Fenner for providing this opportunity to highlight the unprecedented support undertaken by the Morrison government to save lives, cushion the blow and help Australians remain in jobs. In fact, I'm very proud of this particular Liberal approach that the Morrison government has taken to keeping people connected to their jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As this motion outlines, JobKeeper is the largest economic lifeline in Australia's history. In its first phase, it supported over one million business and over 3.8 million jobs, including 6,800 businesses in Higgins. One such business in my electorate supported by JobKeeper was Carnival for Kids, a party shop and children's party venue owned by local mum, Catherine. When COVID-19 hit early last year, Cat watched her busy calendar of upcoming parties and school holiday programs evaporate and, with that, her business confidence and her dreams for the future. She feared having to say goodbye to long-term dedicated staff, and dreams and plans to expand her business felt out of reach. However, thanks to the JobKeeper program, as well as additional targeted government support, Cat has now been able to not only maintain her business but also invest in new capital and keep her staff employed in her team. In fact, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and I had the privilege of seeing firsthand just last week how local kids are enjoying the fantastic premises and fantastic cupcake-making in her glorious and funky studio, in large part thanks to the government's support. A big shout-out to Cat for hosting us; it was great fun being with the kids. Unfortunately, it was the day before lockdown in Melbourne. It was a lovely day, but we've had to backtrack now that we're in lockdown. A shout-out to Cat and all the community for the work they are doing in supporting their businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker Gillespie, you would know as much as I do that the creative and performing arts sector has also been a major beneficiary of JobKeeper, contrary to what members opposite would have us believe. Earlier this month, you, as Chair of the Standing Committee on Communications and the Arts inquiry into Australia's creative and cultural industries and institutions, which in fact I called for, heard that approximate coverage of JobKeeper within the creative and performing arts was around 50 to 60 per cent. By contrast, coverage for all employment was around 30 per cent. We are about the creative and performing arts sector and we are getting on with the business of delivering ongoing support for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So where to now? It's important that we continue to support, as we have, all small businesses, including tax relief, targeted funds for new apprentices and trainees through the JobMaker hiring credit system, and the JobTrainer system. There's so much more that we continue to do. We're about jobs, building back the economy and rolling out the COVID vaccine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly the historic and grand nature of the JobKeeper scheme highlights the Morrison government's commitment to ensuring that Australians are supported when they need it most.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  Let me put on the record that at every step of the way the Labor Party has backed in JobKeeper. It was our and the union movement's idea, and we backed it in from day one. We gave the government all the licence in the world. In fact, we backed laws in the parliament that gave the Treasurer extraordinary powers—wartime powers—to change the JobKeeper requirements as he saw fit. We'll get to that later.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of 2020, 1.54 million Australia were still on JobKeeper. There is a recovery underway, but let's not forget 1.54 million Australians still need this payment. This includes 24,000 Tasmanians who still rely on the subsidy. They need this to keep the lights on, to put food on the table and to get the kids to school—life's essentials. The figures are better on the mainland but in Tasmania a quarter of the jobs lost during COVID are yet to return, so JobKeeper is absolutely essential to my state. More than 45,000 Tasmanians remain unemployed or underemployed, and the recovery from the pandemic in my state is precarious. There's a budget update out today in Tasmania. Unemployment is forecast to be 6.75 per cent in 2022 and 5.5 per cent on the mainland.</span>

                  </a>  Before the suspension I was saying that Tasmania is still in a precarious employment position, with forecast unemployment of 6.75 per cent for 2022 and 5.5 per cent on the mainland; jobs growth in Tasmania projected to be 0.5 per cent in 2022 and 1.5 per cent on the mainland; and economic growth projected to be three per cent in 2022 and 3.5 per cent on the mainland. I give those figures to show that the jobs recovery in Tasmania is not as fast as on the mainland, which is why JobKeeper is so important to our state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The unfortunate thing is that the government just doesn't seem to realise this. The government seems hell-bent on saying 'end of March; that's it'. We have Hobart City Mission in Tasmania preparing for a doubling of demand for emergency relief support. We have the TasCOSS CEO, Adrienne Picone, calling on the Tasmanian Liberal government to:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… go into bat for Tasmanians by advocating for the JobSeeker payment, which currently sits well below the poverty line, to be restored to a liveable, humane rate.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course she's saying that, because with JobKeeper coming off more people will go onto JobSeeker, which is unliveable now. The welfare people in Tasmania know there's a cliff coming. They can see the cliff coming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families and small businesses that are working hard to recover from the COVID-19-induced economic downturn are bracing themselves for the unplugging of the JobKeeper lifeline. Entire sectors, including tourism and hospitality, are now in crisis without government support. These sectors have not recovered. They are not recovering as fast as we would hope. We have lockdowns in Melbourne this week. The situation is fluid, and tourism and hospitality in Tasmania is not recovering as we would hope. Sadly, in the communities built around these sectors jobs have already been lost, and more will go. The tourism industry is crying out for support. Luke Martin, CEO of the Tourism Industry Council Tasmania, says: 'You can't just leave a whole bunch of businesses to fall off a cliff in March and not expect a lot of trauma. There has to be some form of support.' It's not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would like to turn my attention to the rorts side of this equation. Labor support JobKeeper, we always have. We gave extraordinary power to the Treasurer to fix issues. The government got the payments out quickly—terrific; we supported that. We gave the Treasurer the power to fix the problems as they emerged, and he chose not to exercise that power. When the issue emerged of highly profitable businesses giving their CEOs and their executives, their boards and their shareholders millions and millions of dollars in dividends and bonuses, he could have stepped in and fixed it like that. He chose not to. Yet this is the same government that will go to the ends of the earth to chase down $10 from a Centrelink recipient. It's not good enough. It's a double standard of gargantuan proportion. I fully support the member for Fenner in his call for an inquiry into this. Who got the money? If they didn't need it, they should be made to pay it back. The government can't sit on its hands and pretend this problem will go away. It's unfair. It's so demonstrably unfair to the millions of Australians who pay taxes in the belief that it's going to where the relief is needed and not to those who don't need it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VASTA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  JobKeeper has been a lifesaver in my electorate of Bonner. Since JobKeeper was rolled out in March 2020, the payments have provided $83 billion of support to date to businesses and their employees. In my electorate of Bonner more than 5,200 businesses utilise this payment to stay in business and to keep staff in their jobs. While those opposite accuse this program of being a waste, I ask them this: is it a waste to save lives and livelihoods? Is it a waste to save our economy and help businesses recover quickly? Is it a waste to protect Australians from a recession and far worse consequences?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the Reserve Bank of Australia confirmed that our government's quick action to roll out JobKeeper helped reduce total job losses by at least 700,000. That's 700,000 people who were able to put food on the table, pay their mortgage, buy school supplies for their children, keep the lights on, afford medicine and health services and put fuel in their cars. Thanks to JobKeeper and our economic recovery plan 80 per cent of those Australians who, sadly, lost their jobs, or saw their work hours reduced to zero, are now back at work. I wouldn't call those outcomes a waste; I would call them a win for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When JobKeeper first rolled out, I knew we were doing the right thing. In my electorate, I had businesses who had never contacted me before get in touch to share their gratitude for this vital support. Here are just a couple of examples. 'Dear Ross. I just wanted to provide a message of support for the federal government's suite of measures in support of small business during the COVID-19 crisis. The small business stimulus and JobKeeper program will provide a lifeline to our business that will contribute greatly to our chances of survival and recovery on the other side of the pandemic. Despite the inevitable flak that the government will cop in the coming months when a small minority attempt to take advantage of this program, I know that this is excellent public policy. This support will make a substantial difference to the lives of all those who are connected to our business. I would be grateful if you could pass this message on to the team of policymakers. Regards, Anthony of MIG Training.' Consider the message delivered, Anthony, and thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next feedback is from Peter at Wallum Nurseries: 'Our business was falling off a cliff prior to JobKeeper. Once the wage subsidy scheme was implemented, we were able to ensure that we could maintain all our staff, and since then we've even hired another four people part-time.' And, finally, there is some feedback from David at Tangalooma Island Resort on Moreton Island: 'The Morrison government's ongoing leadership and management through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be underestimated. We are deeply appreciative of this critical support we have received as a business in the hospitality and tourism sector during this crisis, specifically regarding the provision of the JobKeeper stimulus package. During this crisis, JobKeeper has been the single most effective form of support our business has received from any level of government. It has enabled us to endure crippling economic conditions and provide an opportunity for our business to build our recovery on the other side. Tangalooma Island Resort employs over 350 staff and provides essential services to our property owners, government emergency services and the ongoing operation of our general resort, hotel and tourism services. The COVID-19 crisis placed us in a position of extreme financial vulnerability, which escalated drastically when we were forced to shut down due to the Queensland government's restrictions. The JobKeeper initiative allowed us to continue our operations, where practical, provided our staff with an ongoing link back to our company and provided us with the opportunity to navigate the complexities of resurrecting and reopening our multifaceted business and broader community again. The significant impact that JobKeeper has had on our business is difficult to articulate but, to put it simply, it's like we would still be in a shutdown mode and would have been forced to lay off in excess of 90 per cent of our employees had this initiative not existed.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those opposite JobKeeper has been deemed a waste, but to the thousands of businesses and people this wage subsidy has helped it has been a wonderful lifesaver.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  I'm grateful to the member for Fenner for bringing this important motion forward for debate and I urge anyone who is watching or listening to get behind his efforts to scrutinise the uneven and unfair application of JobKeeper. That's something you'd think that the government itself might do in relation to the largest one-off commitment of taxpayer's funds in Australia's history but, unfortunately, you'd be wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a basic obligation on government to take action that's necessary and effective, but to do so in a way that is honest and fair. After being dragged by Labor to accept the need for a wage subsidy in the face of a pandemic, the Morrison government has delivered a program that is full of holes and full of blind spots. There is no support for universities, no support for arts and cultural workers, no support for local government employees and no support for nearly a million casuals in Australia at the time of a pandemic. But when it comes to large, profitable companies, companies which actually increased their profits through the circumstances of the pandemic, they have been well looked after. They have received tens of millions of dollars of taxpayer money. As a result, they've paid enormous dividends and executive bonuses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Crown Casino received $111 million in JobKeeper and yet paid a dividend to shareholders of $203 million. Harvey Norman's profits jumped by 160 per cent. They received $9 million in JobKeeper support and then paid $75 million in dividends. And Premier Investment, a retail conglomerate that includes Just Jeans, Portmans and other businesses, received more than $40 million in JobKeeper support but made a bigger profit in 2020 than in 2019. It paid out $57 million in dividends, of which the chairman, Solomon Lew, alone received $24 million. In the circumstances of a pandemic, with economic pain and suffering all around, those companies received $160 million of taxpayer funded support they clearly did not need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the Prime Minister say about that situation? He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Now, if there are some companies that feel that they want to hand that back, great! Good for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Good for them! What did the Minister for Human Services say about the people the government had wrongly and illegally targeted with the industrial-scale cruelty of robodebt? He said: 'We'll find you, we'll track you down, you'll have to pay those debts, you may end up in prison.' No good for poor people, no good for disadvantaged Australians, for veterans, disability pensioners and the unemployed. Not good for them; for them threats, collection letters and legal action. For them penury, deprivation and despair. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As millions have struggled through this pandemic, lost jobs and lost wages and been forced to ransack their superannuation in a falling market, the billionaires of Australia have seen their wealth increase by 50 per cent. How can that be right, and how can a government program contribute to that kind of grotesque outcome? Those massive holes and blind spots, the squeezing of those who have least and taxpayer funded sunshine for those who have plenty corresponds exactly to the value system of this government. We've seen it from the beginning. It goes back to Joe Hockey and the concept of 'lifters and leaners'. While they peddle the rubbish of transcending ideology and occupying the magic world of the pragmatic middle ground, look at the reality: business tax cuts that never trickle down; penalty rate cuts that result in no new jobs; wages as a share of national income at a 50-year low; and unemployment support below the poverty line, with fully one quarter of all single-parent households below the poverty line. At the same time, there are tax cuts for profitable big businesses; personal tax cuts, the vast majority of which benefit high-income earners; and taxpayer funded handouts to businesses whose profits have gone up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a hands-off government. It's a 'nothing to see here' government. It's a 'how dare you question us' government—a government of the spreadsheet for the spreadsheet of their own self-interest; a government that is always there for friendly companies that could use $80 million for water that never arrives or $30 million for Leppington land worth a tenth of that. But it is never, never there for those doing it tough. There are millions of dollars worth of carrots for those doing well, and for those doing it tough it's always the stick. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know what the government will say. They always get wounded and indignant and say, 'We reject the politics of envy.' In the meantime Solomon Lew profits $24 million while a million unemployed Australians crunch back down to $40 a day. In the meantime Australian billionaires grow their wealth by 50 per cent in a single year while 17,000 university workers lose their jobs and a million casuals are denied support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What will the Prime Minister do? He'll get angry and defensive and say, 'We're not into class warfare.' Not half they're not. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (17<span class="HPS-Time">:32</span>):  The Morrison government has always maintained that JobKeeper is a temporary program designed to taper off as economic confidence and momentum builds. Based on what we know, expectations that JobKeeper will extend beyond 30 March are not on. However, we also know the way COVID-19 can extend another wave. We'll have to be flexible, and the Treasury is aware of that fact. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it always has been a temporary program. We're seeing through the 750,000 jobs created so far in the past seven months that fewer businesses and their employees need JobKeeper and other temporary support measures. The government's economic plan also includes a range of stimulus measures apart from JobKeeper and JobSeeker to keep Australians in jobs and in business, including personal income tax, HomeBuilder, the apprenticeship wage subsidy scheme, instant cash write-off and business investment incentives, and JobMaker hiring credits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the economic recovery well under way, Australians have a cause for optimism and hope as we emerge out of this COVID-19 recession. Let's keep the fingers crossed there. JobKeeper remains available to those businesses and organisations experiencing a decline in revenue until the end of March. We'll see what happens after that. All these calls have been received about job shortages. There are lots of industries in my electorate that are saying they cannot get workers to their businesses. I can quote Emerald Tavern. It's short of 10 staff: bottle shop, bar staff, kitchen staff and a chef. The Biloela piggery has vacancies for six workers, but cannot get one. SwarmFarm, a robotic farm near Emerald, at Gindie, wants 10 extra workers—mechanical engineers, an agronomist and market developers and leaders to market their products. Many restaurants in and around Gladstone and Biloela are short of workers. That's the problem Australia's got. I say: let's get Australia working again.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  Like many of my colleagues in this place, I love to spend non-sitting weeks on the streets of my electorate, speaking with small businesses and having in-depth conversations with constituents. Back in August, when I drove my 'conversation caravan' down to Mansfield, a small town on the edge of the Victorian Alps in the south of my electorate, the message was clear from the main street small businesses, local tourism operators and local financial advisers. All of the people I spoke with told me that JobKeeper was a critical lifeline. There was a mood of restrained pessimism. JobKeeper had saved countless businesses from financial ruin and kept employees with no immediate alternatives with pay in their pocket and a connection to their employer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast forward to last week, when I drove that same conversation caravan down to Murrindindi shire and the townships of Alexandra, Yea and Marysville on the fringe the Yarra Valley just outside Melbourne. I spoke with many businesses and community organisations, from Helico Australia and the Grant Street newsagency in Alexandra to the Lake Mountain reception centre and the Marysville and Triangle Community Foundation. It was clear to me that community views have pivoted dramatically since August. For the first time in months I felt a spirit of optimism and energy to get business engines running again and employees back on the books. Quite a number of businesses had already stopped using JobKeeper, and many were keen to do so soon. Some were also concerned that the blunt incentives that JobKeeper is built upon had been open to exploitation, and some told me about market distortion as a result of JobKeeper. All of that might have been a forgivable consequence when we needed to get money out the door asap at the peak of the crisis, but we need to be more diligent now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important to note that it's not optimism all around. I've heard from many travel agents, event businesses, catering services and the like that JobKeeper is still a critical lifeline to them. These businesses aren't ready for any kind of bounce back soon, not least the end of March, and to do so for them would be a disaster. We must also not forget local artists and dedicated academics and administrative staff at our regional universities—all our universities—who were nonsensically locked out of JobKeeper and remain in insecure positions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this tell us? We have to apply common sense when it comes to tapering JobKeeper. First, we need to be there for the businesses ready to jump back in again. They're brave, and we should acknowledge and support their courage and enthusiasm. We should offer these businesses a staged process to make sure they're best positioned to hit the ground running. It also means we should be there if the unexpected happens again, like the snap lockdown in Victoria. This road is not a straight one. Second, we cannot abandon those who are still in economic peril—wedding businesses, casual academics, local painters and freelance graphic designers. The list goes on. These businesses and contractors are still hurting. If the government were not able to be there for them last year, they have a higher duty to them to show up now. Third, we need to get other macroeconomic settings right. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While RBA Governor Philip Lowe was optimistic in his statements earlier this month, they were very cautious and based on some long-bow assumptions. The cash rate remains at 10 basis points. We've just seen another $100 billion out the door in government debt. Wage growth is stuck at the bottom of the barrel, and all prudent economic modelling suggests no significant improvements until 2024 at the very earliest. Sure, you cannot run the Australian economy on tax dollars forever, but that does not mean you can abandon fairness and equity. For example, permanently raising JobSeeker to give those who have few savings the chance to income-smooth and bounce back is smart, value focused economics, not state dependency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The same goes for how we taper JobKeeper. This should not be about turning the tap off overnight. It's also not about picking winners and losers sector by sector. It's about being rational, considered and specific about how we wean off JobKeeper so that the economy at large is best positioned to recover and thrive again.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr DRUM:</span>
                  </a>  The horticulture industry in Victoria is facing an unbelievable crisis on the back of the total inaction from the Daniel Andrews government in Victoria. Unpicked fruit is now being left by the pickers—fruit that would be picked each and every year. The farmers are now having to go through the heartbreaking role of going into the orchards, picking their very best fruit and leaving 20 to 30 per cent of perfectly good fruit on the trees because they have been unable to get the labour force they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 11 December, after some heated questioning at the national cabinet, Daniel Andrews faced the media and acknowledged that he had a role and a responsibility to bring 15,000 to 20,000 workers into Victoria. He acknowledged that this was his responsibility and he acknowledged that other states had already moved in this area. He acknowledged that the Northern Territory had already brought in mango pickers from the Pacific islands, where they were free of the virus. He then acknowledged that Queensland had brought in pickers from the Pacific islands and put them into quarantine, on-farm protocol. That state and that territory were able to put in place the pickers they needed, and the federal government facilitated all the way through. All the way through, that state and that territory—both Labor governments, by the way—were able to get the assistance they needed with a very quick phone call. We effectively had the federal government stamping the visas and allowing these people to come in, but the guidelines and the protocols for the movements of the pickers were put in place by the states. The pickers were sourced by the states. This is the states' responsibility.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr DRUM:</span>
                  </a>  Why on earth would the member for Franklin want to come in and somehow or other start being untruthful about this? The quarantine process is put in place purely by the states. We have told Victoria—and Daniel Andrews has acknowledged this—that it is their responsibility to get these pickers into Victoria. So Daniel Andrews has now made a decision to bring in 1,500 pickers. We didn't make that decision; he made the decision to bring in 1,500 workers. Daniel Andrews has put in place a time line that will probably run post the end of the financial year, when all of the fruit will have already dropped on the ground and rotted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Normally, inaction is a course taken by the bureaucracy and the departments who don't want to do anything different to what has already been done. Normally, it's a safe pair of hands just to do nothing. But doing nothing in this area has been incredibly damaging. It is going to cost $350 million minimum—that is the cost that they are putting on the farms. Not only that; there is the opportunity of creating a Queensland fruit fly phenomenon that they'll never be able to get back on top of. Normally, a few fruit falling on the ground in backyard orchards in the towns creates a huge problem for getting on top of Queensland fruit fly. But to have literally thousands of tonnes lying on the ground around the orchards is going to create an absolute haven for Queensland fruit fly and create serious problems into the future because we've been unable to get this fruit off the trees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is one thing for a government to have a gigantic failure. I understand it. They're absolutely scared senseless that they're going to bring the virus into Victoria. I get that. But they showed that they could do it for the tennis championships. To bring the Australian Open and to make it work, they've taken huge risks, and it looks like they may get through this. But, if they can take huge risks for a tennis tournament, surely they can take the lesser risks, because they're not bringing these pickers in from countries that are rife with the virus; they're bringing these pickers in from areas that are clean. They have proven that they can take these risks for the Australian Open, but they've also proven that they will not take any risks for the people of the horticultural industry, and it's a disgrace.</span>

Here again is the federal government trying to walk away from its responsibilities, like it does all of the time. I mean, really: what is the point of them being in government? They're responsible for quarantine, they're responsible for the Seasonal Worker Program and they haven't done either in this case. Yes, there's fruit rotting—absolutely. There has been at least $45 million to date. I've been up to see some farmers in my home state, and they're having the same issue. They have dumped fruit because they haven't been able to get workers. It is happening all over the country because the government didn't do its job and because the minister didn't do his job.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Agricultural Workforce Strategy has been sitting on the minister's desk since October. What has he done? Absolutely nothing. That's what he's done. It's disgraceful that the farmers, after what they went through last year with droughts and fires, now have got the good weather and a bumper crop but can't pick it, because the government didn't do its job. And they want to come in here and blame premiers? That is just outrageous. It is outrageous that they are trying to blame state premiers when they didn't do their job as a government, because that's exactly what's happened here.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government is responsible for quarantine. The federal government is responsible for seasonal workers. Queensland is going to be in a similar position in weeks because they still don't have enough workers either. This is the member's government that hasn't done its job. The minister came out and he said he had all these workers lined up and he was going to do this workforce strategy, and we have nothing. We have nothing because the government didn't do its job in quarantine and still isn't doing its job in quarantine. The member's government hasn't done its job in terms of the Seasonal Worker Program. They have not done their job.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have farmers who are just beside themselves with their bumper crop that they thought would turn it around after everything that's happened to them. After everything they've been through, finally they get a bumper crop and they don't have the workers to get it off, and that is the government's fault. It is not the state and territory governments' fault.</span>

They haven't been able to get the produce off because the government hasn't done their job. That is absolutely what has happened here. I cannot believe that they would put a motion like this, trying to blame one state premier for an issue in one state, when this is a nationwide issue. It is happening all around the country.

Where is the empathy for all the families and friends I know that have gone in to help the farmers pick their crop and for all the local employment programs, where people are actually trying to get people trained to get this produce out of the farms and onto the tables and into the supermarkets around Australia? I'm standing with the farmers; it's a shame the government didn't.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281688" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  I rise to offer my support to this motion moved by the member for Nicholls. Along with Nicholls, my electorate of Mallee is a leading producer of horticultural products. The north-west and South Australian region, which almost entirely encompasses Mallee, produces 100 per cent of the almonds grown in Victoria, with a gross value of over $480 million in 2019. We also produce 99 per cent of Victoria's table grapes, valued at $347 million; 98 per cent of Victoria's oranges, valued at $66 million; and 62 per cent of Victoria's nectarines, valued at $59 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the horticultural products produced in Mallee and around the country are highly labour intensive, and the sector is dependent on overseas workers to get their products to our plates. Growers in both Mallee and Nicholls, as well as many other regions in Australia, are currently staring down the barrel of massive losses due to a lack of workers. I've spoken to several growers who are worried that their fruit is going to fall to the ground. Many have already made the heartbreaking decision to plough their entire crop into the ground. One such farmer in Lake Boga, in my electorate, is Ian McAlister, who aimed to pull off a fabulous crop but is down 25 to 30 workers. Shockingly, he had to plough in his entire peach crop valued at $300,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I met with young innovators and farmers, Dean Morpeth and Mick Young, creators of SHARP Fruit, in <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Roboto;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Woorinen, </span>at their packing sheds. I was so impressed with their set-up and the workers who were packing the most beautiful fruit. They are currently over 20 workers short. Normally they would employ well over 60 people but this year they are down to just 40. They've had to shut down an entire packing line. This is lost revenue for the entire district. If producers can't sell their fruit and it can't be packed and sent in a timely manner, they lose it. This has a flow-on effect for all of our towns—the cafes and the other businesses. Mick and Dean expect next year to be worse if international borders don't open, as more people on working holiday-maker visas are forced to return to their home countries. I've also met with Darren Minter of Minter Magic, in Iraak. Minter Magic is famous for asparagus. I can tell you firsthand the asparagus is amazing. But asparagus is incredibly labour intensive also. Darren can see the writing on the wall and so is transitioning away from asparagus and into less labour-intensive crops, such as almonds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These decisions are facing many producers around the country. A report by consultancy firm EY released in September last year painted a grim picture of expected workforce shortages. The analysis showed that industry could expect a shortfall of up to 26,000 workers between June 2020 and December 2021. This translates to a net gap of 20 per cent to 33 per cent over an 18-month period. Consequently, the horticulture industry has suffered greatly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August 2020 the Commonwealth and state governments, through the national cabinet, entered into an agreement to restart the Seasonal Worker Program. As mentioned in the terms of this motion, the Commonwealth has worked with partner nations to develop a pool of 20,000 pre-vetted work-ready Pacific Islanders who are eager to come to Australia to help with the harvests around the nation. It is the responsibility of each state and territory government to put in place arrangements for managing the arrival of workers, consistent with their respective public health orders and within their caps on international arrivals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately for the horticulture industry in Victoria, the Andrews Labor government has failed to implement adequate quarantine measures in a timely manner and therefore to provide workers to farms. While the Andrews government has entered an agreement with the Tasmanian government to quarantine 1,500 seasonal workers in Tasmania, this measure does not meet the demand for Victoria's growers and comes too late for too many. Clearly COVID-19 has made it more difficult to find workers, but these challenges have existed for many years, prior to the pandemic, and will persist into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Providing growers with better access to legal, sustainable sources of low- and semi-skilled workers for seasonal work is something I am passionate about. That's why I recently produced a policy document on the seasonal workforce to take to the Nationals policy committee. The COVID-19 pandemic provides the perfect opportunity to act on this urgent issue in order to secure the future of this vibrant industry.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E09" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for moving this motion on the horticulture industry, because it gives me an opportunity to talk about horticulture in the area I live in, which of course is Greater Sydney. I doubt that many people know this, but agricultural production in the Greater Sydney region is valued at about $1 billion, compared with the state's $16 billion. So, it is actually an incredibly large part of the food production for the region. In fact, 20 per cent of the fresh food that goes into the CBD is grown in the Sydney basin, including in the member's own seat of Nicholls. It really is quite incredible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we can't conclude that this situation will continue, because the planning that the New South Wales government has introduced allows so much of our really good-quality agricultural farmland to be concreted over and turned into urban sprawl. If the current trend continues, in the next decades we're likely to see the 20 per cent of fresh food that is going into Sydney from local farmland go down to five per cent. That is a significant shift, and going the wrong way, given the changing nature of our climate and the kinds of circumstances that will impact our food supply chains locally—bushfires, changing climate, overseas disruption et cetera.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be looking at what several other countries around the world are looking at: how we reduce our food miles and fragment our supply chains so that there are a variety of sources of food quite close to where we live. I know that a number of organisations in Western Sydney, including a range of businesses, are working on just that. I want to point out that there's a really great project coming our way, courtesy of the New South Wales state government. I don't always praise the New South Wales state government, but the Western Sydney Aerotropolis research centre for agribusiness is actually a very good idea—a world-class research and innovation centre proposed for the precinct, focused entirely on agribusiness, at the Western Sydney Aerotropolis, which will tap into the region's history of food production—and we have quite an extensive one. We also have quite a history in food processing. In fact, Western Sydney is the largest food processor in Australia. So, we are very much about food; it's just that we don't always realise it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan will be on exhibition until 28 February. It outlines a vision for 10 precincts surrounding the airport. This is a really great project. The University of Western Sydney is well and truly involved in this, as are the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries facility the Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute, Richmond High School and Richmond TAFE at Hawkesbury. So, we will be seeing some really high-tech work done in the Western Sydney region, and that's an incredibly important thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world faces a really interesting dilemma when it comes to food production. It's estimated that by 2050 we won't be feeding the 7.5 billion people we're feeding now; we'll be feeding 10 billion. It's estimated that over the next four decades we'll have to produce the same amount of food that farmers all around the world produced in 8,000 years. There will need to be a massive increase in the amount of food that's produced on the land we currently have and with the water resources we currently have while we deal with climate change and while we deal with that fact that whole areas that we currently farm will become less viable. We are facing quite a serious dilemma. In fact, there are many reports now that say that famine will be the issue of the 21st century, and there's no doubt that is right. We can see that beginning to happen now. We can already see the rise of famine across the world due to changing climate. Australia should be in an extraordinary position to contribute. When you talk to our farmers, there is the research being done on farms, the improvement of soil and the use of drone technology. The work that our farmers are doing to improve productivity is quite incredible.</span>

The Netherlands has half the land mass of Tasmania and it has 1,300 inhabitants per square mile.

It's important that we understand clearly the challenge Australia's horticultural producers are facing as we move through this very intense harvest period that begins, particularly in terms of southern Australia, around February and runs all the way through June, particularly as it relates to citrus. I stand in support because, as you know, Deputy Speaker Gillespie, I represent the great people of the Riverland in South Australia. Barker is an agricultural powerhouse. While there is horticulture throughout the electorate, much of it is heavily mechanised. The labour-intensive horticultural effort finds itself, if you like, concentrated in the Riverland around sectors like stone fruit, but principally citrus. As ingenious as man is, no man has been able to effectively invent a machine that can, via means of mechanical operation, harvest a citrus tree. What it requires, if anyone wants to know, is moving relatively light, yet still somewhat heavy, aluminium ladders and literally picking fruit by fruit by fruit. That harvest—</span>

                  </a>  I have to tell you, colleagues, I've done a bit of it, but, given my shape, I probably should do a lot more of it! We have such a substantial citrus industry in South Australia and across the nation that our need for harvest pickers through that March to June period is gargantuan. We're talking about thousands of people. There isn't one Australian producer who doesn't want to see Australians picking this fruit. Someone may come into this place and suggest this is a crisis that has been borne of COVID-19. No; it has simply been exacerbated by the settings. For a very long time, we've been unsuccessful in motivating Australians to travel and undertake this seasonal work. With a lot of the measures we've adopted, and this is irrespective of the government privileged to be in charge of the Treasury benches, it is effectively the equivalent of putting different forms of bandaids on a bullet wound. COVID has made this so much worse. It's made it worse because, as ABARES tells us, at any point in time we have over 63,000 backpackers in the country, many of whom do 88 days of work in regional communities to effectively earn the right for an additional period in Australia. Of course on account of the pandemic we don't have the privilege of working holiday-makers coming to Australia. I don't want to alarm colleagues but it is real; we are seeing citrus producers, who pour all their input into growing oranges, limes and lemons—using expensive water, expensive inputs like pesticides, expensive inputs like fertiliser—getting their fruit to the point where they're now very anxious about getting people into the country to pick the fruit.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has 25,000 willing workers in the Pacific Islands ready to come and do that work today. Before those opposite say this is a partisan attack on state governments, I have got to tell you, my call-out is to all state governments—Liberal and Labor—including my own state Liberal government in South Australia: look to what Annastacia Palaszczuk has done, allow on-farm quarantine. Allow these workers to come on farm, quarantine and work for two weeks and then go about making life easier for Australian producers. I don't want to see that fruit rotting on the tree. I don't want to see Aussie fruit prices in supermarkets going up because we didn't get the fruit off.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Nicholls for bringing this motion. It is an incredible opportunity for me to talk about the benefits and the great the virtues of the Macarthur electorate. The Macarthur electorate is named after John and Elizabeth Macarthur, widely known as the founders of the Australian wool industry, but in fact they were the founders of the Australian horticulture industry. Camden Park, their property, still exists. It is part of the Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute which surrounds Camden Park. Camden Park is still owned by the descendants of John and Elizabeth Macarthur. John Macarthur and Edwina Macarthur Stanham still live there. On that property are the remnants of the founding of the Australian horticulture industry. There are the grapevines. There are orchards which demonstrate where Australian agriculture and horticulture first started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting that the reasons for the beginning of that horticultural industry then are similar to the situation we find ourselves in now, in that we have difficulty accessing markets and difficulty accessing foods that we want, so we have to grow them ourselves. So it is very opportune that this motion is being moved. I think that John and Elizabeth Macarthur would be very upset if they saw what had happened to much of the agricultural land around their original property, which has now succumbed, unfortunately, to urban sprawl, because governments have decided that this urban sprawl, these houses, are much more valuable than the agricultural land that they're built on. It is a shame to see that some of the orchards that were there in my childhood are now houses for what is effectively urban sprawl. There are still, however, a large number of Macarthur residents who work in the agricultural and horticultural sector, and we still have a number of large farms in the area. As I've mentioned, the Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute is, at least partly, in my electorate of Macarthur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a society there are many lessons that we have learnt from the pandemic, which is still ongoing. One of those was that we should plan adequately for any eventuality and we should plan our workforce adequately. Unfortunately, this is something that the federal government hasn't learnt. We haven't had cooperation in getting a workforce to our agricultural and horticultural sector like we should have, and we're paying the price for that in lack of people to pick our fruit and to till our soils. This could have been planned for much more adequately had the government sought to work cooperatively with the state governments around the country. From Tasmania to the Northern Territory, to Queensland and to Western Australia it could have been done much, much better. Our horticultural products are the best in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward, with great excitement, to the developments around the aerotropolis of Western Sydney Airport, with our high-value agricultural products being able to get to markets around the world due to the access to the airport. Unfortunately, the transport around the airport has not been developed adequately—particularly from the south, where most of the agricultural land is. That will further limit our ability to get our high-value products to the rest of the world. I'm a great believer that, as a country, we should make and produce things. Support should not just be for our manufacturing industry but of course in our agricultural sector. We have huge ability to produce agricultural and horticultural products in our country. In my electorate of Macarthur we have some of the best food-processing companies in Australia and yet they're being denied adequate support, denied an adequate workforce and denied the ability to get those products to the rest of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's bizarre that the National Party are presenting motions like this, when they themselves have done very little in their electorates to promote Australian horticulture and getting our high-value products to the rest of the world. I commend the member for bringing this motion, but I'd like to see the National Party and his government do more to promote Australia's fantastic horticultural products to the rest of the world. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  Today I would like to speak on how the Morrison government is committed to making sure that Australia's agricultural sector has the workers it needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right from the beginning of this pandemic, the Morrison government has acted to make sure that our farmers are supported. We have acted to make sure that our agricultural sector can continue to operate in a safe way. Firstly, this government extended visas for overseas workers. These workers supplement our highly skilled Australian farmers. Secondly, we provided incentives for Australians to move to the bush to work in the agricultural sector. We recommenced the Pacific Labour Mobility Scheme and this government put in place the National Agricultural Workers Code to facilitate the movement of agricultural workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All this was done early on to make sure that this sector could continue to operate. In March, this government sat down with each of the states. We said that we needed to develop a plan to make sure that our agricultural sector keeps moving. In August we said that we wanted to see more Aussies working in the regions, while still relying on Pacific and seasonal workers. We pre-vetted 25,000 men and women from 10 Pacific nations to give our farmers the boost that they needed. The federal government was ready.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, at national cabinet the states said that they wanted to run their own quarantine arrangements. They wanted to do that and they told the federal government no. Daniel Andrews, who has continually failed Victoria and Victorians time and time again, now says that maybe the federal government should be running the quarantine program. I find this to be a bit rich after he told us no several times. Andrews wants to continue doing everything himself. Aspen Health, an internationally recognised organisation, put a proposal to the Victorian government, saying, 'We have a plan to take over hotel quarantine and to help Victoria's farmers.' The Andrews government did nothing for six months. Only in January did Andrews come up with arrangements to support farmers. The arrangements were light on detail and relied heavily on Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so pleased to have seen flights arrive in the Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania to help farmers and the meat-processing sector. Victoria is the only state not to bring in a single worker. Daniel Andrews is letting Victoria down again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's second largest state, thanks to Premier Andrews, is being outperformed by our smallest jurisdiction. The Northern Territory has put in place arrangements to see workers start on 5 August. They are leading the way. I believe that the Premier of Victoria should be looking out for the interests of all Victorians, so I ask: why are regional Victorians being left in the lurch? Regional Australia is the engine room of Australia's economy, but Premier Andrews refuses to provide the grease to rev the sector up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our farmers are tired of waiting on Premier Andrews. We need action from a premier that is hell-bent on locking up Victoria. Our farmers deserve better, Victorians deserve better and Australia deserves better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  I can't agree with the previous speaker; I consider the Victorian Premier better than a comedy hour!

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 220,000 backpackers in Australia when COVID hit. Half of those, according to the ABS, were employed in agriculture. When I say in agriculture, I refer to how one of my parliamentary chiefs of staff said they had hotels in Hughenden, and their backpackers were classed as rural employees. Of course, in a very real sense, they are. That's a cattle area and, when the cattle people come to town, they stay overnight, so in a very real sense they're employees. According to statistics, by June of this year there will be no backpackers at all in Australia, so where do we get 50,000 workers from? I truly don't know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hotel in Atherton—and I stay there because I enjoy all the partying by all the backpackers—had 92 backpackers stay there, but every farmer who's short of a worker just rings up the BV, or the Barron Valley, as it's called, and they will get workers out on the farm. That hotel has pioneered backpacker accommodation and backpackers as a source of workers in the area. Also, they are young people and they create an atmosphere. They swim in the big pool right in the centre of Cairns, and it's really great fun for young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this crisis has brought an issue to a head. Up until last year, I reckon everyone had the freedom that, if they didn't want to work, they didn't have to work. Well, yes, you have the right not to work, but you have no right to take money off the people that are working. If a bloke wants to lounge around all day, watching the television, he doesn't take work off some poor beggar that has to get up at 7.30 in the morning, spend an hour or half an hour getting to work and half an hour getting home in the afternoon. He should not be paying for you to sit at home all day and watch the television. We're looking at about 20 per cent of the Australian work force fitting into that category. They're hiding among the disabled. They're hiding in the university and education sector. They're hiding all over the place. If you compare the people that were working—my generation, but even the generation below me—with the people that are working now, there's a hell of a lot of them just simply hiding out. Disability is one of the great places to hide out. I think we've arrived at that point.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion outlines the need for a comprehensive approach to the reform of Australian parenting policies. Today, The Parenthood group and Equity Economics released a report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Making Australia the best place in the world to be a parent</span>—an ambitious but important goal. The report highlights the economic and social benefits of the policy proposals, including an estimated increase to GDP of 4.1 per cent, or some $166 billion, by 2050. And if we can get female workforce participation up to the same level as male participation, GDP would increase up to 8.7 per cent—some $353 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 2.6 million families in Australia with dependent children under the age of 15. In Warringah, we have 20,000 of those families, and many have told me of the need for a more supportive approach and that there is a disincentive to return to work due to the costs of child care and the discrimination experienced in the workplace. A more consistent and supportive approach to parenting strategy in Australia is required to address these concerns. From my own experience with young children, starting my career as a lawyer and then at the New South Wales bar, it was already incredibly frustrating that conferences to exotic overseas locations, holidays and ski trips were all tax deductible, but the real everyday cost of child care was not. It was, and remains, so high. The tax system is not gender neutral and it's time our system caught up with the 21st century and the reality of working parents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID-19 threw into stark relief the inadequacy of the current policy suite at supporting families in Australia. Parents across the country were homeschooling their children. Many struggled without access to carers leave and were without access to child care. The government intervened to provide temporary relief through free child care, which was welcomed by many parents, but it was a minefield, and some providers, for example, were unable to afford the rent or staff required to stay open in many areas. There is a lot of complexity around this area, but if we've seen one thing it's that the COVID recession impacted the jobs of women and female-dominated industries far more than the jobs of men and male-dominated industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget response last October to this pink recession was unfortunately a very blokey budget, and it was heavily criticised. It's now clearly squarely on the agenda for the Prime Minister and the government to address this in the May budget. In preparing the May budget, I urge the government to consider The Parenthood's report, which delivers a blueprint for a comprehensive Australian parenting strategy post COVID. The tools for achieving this include universal health and wellbeing support for parents and children through pregnancy and early years, and a parental leave scheme that provides one year of paid leave to be shared equally between parents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has one of the worst rates of participation by fathers in parental leave. We need this to improve, and we need sufficient parental leave, across both parents, to ensure that it is not one parent—generally the woman—who is disproportionately disadvantaged and disincentivised from returning to the workforce. And we need free and high-quality childhood education and care for all families, and of course flexible and supportive workplaces with universal access to paid carers leave for sick children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paid parental leave is something that's very important. Australia has one of the least adequate parental leave schemes among OECD countries. The average length of paid parental leave among OECD countries is 55 weeks, while Australia has 18 weeks. Paid parental leave in Australia is granted to one parent, the primary caregiver, whereas in other OECD countries it can be shared. More equitable paid parental leave schemes are important because they will encourage fathers into caring roles, improving their long-term bond with children, improving participation in unpaid work in households and creating an appreciation of the work involved in raising a child. It will also provide primary carers with the opportunity to return to their careers sooner and more sustainably.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Child care is commonly viewed as child minding rather than the early education of children, and that needs to change because some great gains can be made. We need attention to women in the next budget, and I would encourage the Prime Minister to have better female representation on the Expenditure Review Committee to ensure an equitable budget.</span>

I do disagree with the member for Warringah on a very important point, and that is that I think right now Australia is the best place to raise a family. Where else would you rather be? It disappoints me so often that Labor and Independent members are willing to talk down Australia and Australian society in terms of the opportunities we give to Australian families and to our kids, and that we are delivering for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've lived my whole life in the Ryan electorate, and I now raise my young family there, so it's something I can talk about from personal experience, along with the other 39,000 families who live in the Ryan electorate. They gave me the honour of representing them in this place, and I made a commitment that I would look out for the families in the Ryan electorate and across Australia in the work that we are able to do. So it is a great pleasure to talk, in response to this motion, about the significant efforts the Morrison government is making to ensure that the opportunities for Australian families are significant and to ensure that families are kept healthy and safe. There is certainly no place you would want to be other than Australia, particularly in this past year through COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just about keeping you healthy and safe, although that is important. Brand new medicines are being listed on the PBS every week—life-changing medicines for Australian families—that are possible only because of the Morrison government's commitment to the financial discipline that simply couldn't—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SIMMONDS:</span>
                  </a>  I'll take the Labor member's interjection. He says the PBS is bipartisan. But they couldn't do it. Labor members couldn't do it. They had to stop listing medicines on the PBS. Labor actually stopped listing life-saving medicines because of financial constraints. What an indictment on their government, that they couldn't achieve it. This government, the Morrison government, does achieve that for families. We have been able to put record amounts of funding into frontline mental health support services as well, such as Kids Helpline—things that are practical improvements in families' lives—and to give them the support they need, particularly at this difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is also making important strides in increasing flexibility in the workplace for families. Last year the Morrison government passed the Paid Parental Leave Act 2020, which delivered just that—greater flexibility when it comes to the parental leave system. Before this bill was passed, paid parental leave could only be taken in a continuous 18-week block within the first 12 months of the birth or adoption of a child. Now, these new measures allow families to split their parental leave entitlement into blocks of leave, with an initial period to be taken in the first 12 months and the remaining six weeks to be taken at a later time within two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures are designed to change what are traditionally viewed as social norms and encourage secondary carers to take parental leave. More importantly, they give families choice. That's what the Morrison government believes in and what I believe so passionately in—that families know what is best for them, that they know how to give opportunity to their kids. We're about enabling them to have that choice—not telling them how to raise their family or the manner in which they should do it but providing as much choice as we possibly can. We all know what a juggling act it is to be a parent. We see many private companies now responding to the changing needs of parents, particularly mums, providing more benefits above the minimum standards as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is this time as well, with COVID. Any family's life is stressful with the added pressures of restrictions and lockdowns. Many workers have had their employment interrupted, which would have been an issue for the parental leave test period. So as not to place further financial stress on families, the Morrison government has amended this test for a limited time so that parents must have worked 10 out of 20 months, not the previous 13 months, so that they won't be disadvantaged when it comes to taking this important leave. Again, it shows how this government is about supporting parents, particularly in paid parental leave, and giving them the choices they need to best raise their families. I'm very proud of what the Morrison government has achieved to support Australian families and what it is continuing to do and will do, with the vaccine rollout and other measures, to support the 39,000 Ryan families. I will continue to be a loud voice for them in this place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:41</span>):  I thank the member for Warringah for bringing this important motion to the House, speaking to the report by The Parenthood and Equity Economics called <span style="font-style:italic;">Making Australia the best place in the world to </span><span style="font-style:italic;">be a parent</span>. That means that making Australia the best place in the world to raise a child would make it the best place in the world to be a child. Just think about that, if our nation were known for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Too many Australian parents with children under five are caught in a trap of inadequate paid parental leave, lack of affordable high-quality learning, perinatal discrimination and myriad other social and economic barriers to workplace participation—indeed, the full enjoyment of family life. Too many Australian children are suffering because of this. In the first five years of life children's brains are wired to learn quickly. Early learning helps to amplify their natural skills and abilities and to prepare them to thrive in later years. Children who attend early learning services are 33 per cent less likely to be developmentally vulnerable when they start school than those who do not attend early learning services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the introduction of universal access to preschool in 2009 Australia has made progress in the proportion of children enrolled in a preschool program in the year before school. But most of our peer countries in the OECD already provide at least two years of preschool and have done so for decades. Countries in our region are rapidly ramping up access to two years of preschool, framing this as a necessary investment in human capital and future productivity—countries in our region, right next door to us. Investing in an additional year of preschool is really the next big policy opportunity for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural children and families are hit by these failures even harder. Noting that early childhood care and education is a private-public market and that our government has continued to encourage parents to shop around to ensure they are getting value for money—well, when there's one provider within 50 kilometres, if you are lucky, it's pretty hard to shop around. UNICEF has ranked Australia 32nd out of 41 nations for child wellbeing in 2020. This is shameful and it needs to change, and we can make it change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from my experience both as a parent and as a frontline worker, as a midwife, the kinds of stresses that parents face. There are parents at the emergency department in what we call the witching hours, between six and midnight—stressed, uncertain, seeking support, worried about a child who they might need to stay home from work tomorrow to look after. I know that we can get better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report published today by The Parenthood and Equity Economics provides the solutions, and they're straightforward and compelling. What we need here is action. We know from this report that we need significant investment in four key areas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need universal health and wellbeing support for parents and children, through pregnancy and the early years. Gold standard care requires access to mental health support through ongoing access to screening, telehealth and continuity of care throughout pregnancy—and that's something I happen to know a lot about. We know that continuity of midwifery care in this nation is only available to a handful of families right across our system, yet, if they receive it, we know it's good for mothers, good for babies and good for families: they're less likely to have an operative birth, they're less likely to have a preterm birth, they're less likely to have low-birth-weight babies and they have higher satisfaction and earlier onset of breastfeeding. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that mental health challenges are severe and concerning for both mothers and fathers, and we know that fathers are very unlikely to seek help. The transition to parenthood makes them vulnerable to experiencing anxiety and depression for the very first time in their life. A paid parental scheme is important for both parents. I've studied and undertaken research in Sweden, where there are 480 days of parental leave which can be shared. So, yes, we've made a beginning, but we've got so much further to go. We know that women who get more parental leave than the government system have better mental health, and if the women have better mental health and the fathers have better mental health we know that the children will do better, too. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Free and high-quality early childhood education and care for families are crucial. We should be increasing our childhood education for these young children. Finally, we need flexible and supportive workplaces, with universal access to paid carers leave. As we've seen during the COVID pandemic, we need flexible workplaces that allow parents to work from home in a blended model, if they can. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this motion to the House, and I encourage the government to step up to the plate on improving access to these services.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  I wish to congratulate and thank the member for Warringah for putting this very important issue on the agenda here today. It's an issue that is seeing a constraint on Australia's economic development and a constraint on the development of families in our community as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's Paid Parental Leave scheme was introduced by Labor and started on 1 January 2011. When the scheme was introduced, Australia was one of only two OECD nations that didn't have a national scheme of that nature, with the United States being the other. In 2021, the current Paid Parental Leave scheme is up to 18 weeks at the minimum wage, and it's below the OECD average of 50-plus weeks leave. Australia now ranks fourth among OECD nations for some of the highest childcare costs in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paid parental leave signals to employers and the Australian community that parents taking time out of the paid workforce to care for a child is part of the usual course of life and should be supported by government. It also enables participation of women in particular in the workforce. A high workforce participation rate is important in the context of an ageing population and the economic recovery from the impact of COVID. It helps to address the gender pay gap as well, particularly for those women on low and middle incomes who have less access to employer funded parental leave. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gender pay gap remains a big problem in Australia and has remained stubbornly high over the past two decades, with only minor changes which are widely attributed to the ending of the mining boom. If the Morrison government were genuinely serious about fixing the gender pay gap, they would oppose cuts to penalty rates. The vast majority of workers who have had their penalty rates cut in this country have, unfortunately, been women working in itinerate work in the hospitality and retail sectors. Those cuts to penalty rates are exacerbating the gender pay gap by making it harder for women to earn a decent income and to pay the rent and cover their bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paid parental leave is also meant to promote equality between men and women and the balance between work and family life, yet the shortcomings in the current approach are impacting constituents not only in my electorate but across the country. One example is Catherine. Catherine is the main income earner in her household, but she is unable to receive paid parental leave support because her income is too high; yet if their roles were switched and her husband were earning the same salary then Catherine would be entitled to the benefit. It's because the current test is based on the mother's income, not the overall household income. That is not only hampering that particular family's earning capacity and ability to support their family and grow it but also a handbrake on our economic development. With gender roles now less defined and double income the norm, is it the best approach to help working families if we have this impediment built into the system?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is particularly the case given that increasing childcare costs are also locking many Australian parents out of the workforce. We've seen in the recent Productivity Commission report on government services in 2021 that almost 300,000 Australians are not in the labour force because they are caring for children, and the number of parents saying they are not working mainly due to the cost of child care has skyrocketed by 23 per cent. This confirms that the cost of child care is prohibiting Australian parents from working the hours that they want. With the Morrison government itself predicting fee increases without CPI for years to come, the hits will keep on coming for Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that there is a problem in this area, and that is why Labor has developed its plan for cheaper child care—to support those working families to work the hours that they can and want to support their families. That's why we will scrap the $10,500 childcare subsidy cap, which often sees women losing money for working an extra day's work; lift the maximum childcare subsidy rate to 90 per cent; and increase the childcare subsidy rates and taper them for every family earning less than $530,000 a year. Importantly, the ACCC will be tasked with designing a price regulation mechanism to ensure that the costs are kept down. It's important that we support families to work the hours that they need to support their families as they're growing. But the current system is an impost on that, because working that extra day is often impaired by the way the subsidy works. That's why Labor's plan will deal with this issue.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>):  I'm pleased to speak on the motion moved by the member for Warringah which acknowledges the benefits to Australia from increasing female workforce participation, gender equity and outcomes for children by lowering the cost of early childhood education for all families. Sadly, women in Australia continue to take on the lion's share of family and caring responsibilities. Australian women do almost twice as much unpaid household work and caring work as men—and I'm making this speech here in Canberra while my wife, Lee, is in Brisbane with our children. Hopefully, she isn't listening to the Federation Chamber at this time! Of course women's career paths are often negatively impacted by pregnancy and caring responsibilities. Affordable care for Australian children is crucial. Without it, many parents, most often the mother, are forced to give up or turn down work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are just two and a half years into the coalition's childcare system—the one the Prime Minister dubbed a 'once-in-a-generation reform' and that he personally promised would make child care more affordable. Sadly, ABS data shows that, for parents in Brisbane, child care is now more expensive than when the Morrison system was introduced. The Morrison system has done the opposite to what Prime Minister Morrison promised. Families are struggling and yet the 2020 budget had no plan for child care. Families are being crippled by ever-increasing childcare fees. They've seen an increase of 7.2 per cent in just one year—and, guess what? Wages aren't increasing at 7.2 per cent. In fact, wages are flatlining.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that having more women in the workforce is better for the economy. A recent Productivity Commission report confirmed that the cost of child care is prohibiting parents from working the hours they want. The report revealed that almost 300,000 Australians are not in the labour force due to caring for children—all that potential. More than 90,000 of these parents say that they are not working mainly due to the cost of child care. The boost to our economy from reduced childcare costs has been modelled by KPMG and the Grattan Institute. That modelling revealed the boost to our GDP from increased workforce participation was at least $7.5 billion and up to $10 million. So it makes sound economic sense to reduce childcare costs. Every family with young children in my electorate of Moreton knows that the high cost of child care is a hit to household budgets and a brake on women's workforce participation—all that potential being untapped. It's also a huge hit to our economy as a whole.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion notes that Australia has one of the least generous paid parental leave schemes in the OECD. Parents, both mothers and fathers, should be able to take time off to look after their newborns without having to worry about how they can pay the rent. Since the coalition have been in government, they've tried to slash paid parental leave five times. The coalition have called mothers rorters, double-dippers and fraudsters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor actually understands how important it is for parents to spend those early weeks with their child. You don't get that time back. It's good for the babies and it's good for the parents' wellbeing too. When in government, Labor implemented the first national paid parental leave scheme and introduced dad and partner pay. From opposition, Labor blocked the coalition government's attempt to slash paid parental leave. As a dad and as a former teacher, I know how important those early years are in a child's life. It's important to have those days and weeks after the birth of a child to bond and for babies and parents to settle in. It's important for parents to have access to good-quality, low-cost child care so they can get back into the workforce when they are ready.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike this government, Labor, under Anthony Albanese, has a plan to bring down the cost of child care and keep it down. Our cheaper child care for working families policy will scrap the $10,560 childcare subsidy cap, which often sees women losing money from that extra day's work, will lift the maximum childcare subsidy rate to 90 per cent, will increase childcare subsidy rates and taper them for every family earning less than $530,000. Labor will ask the ACCC to design a price regulation mechanism to shed light on costs and fees and drive them down for good. With the aim of implementing a universal 90 per cent subsidy for all families, the Productivity Commission will conduct a comprehensive review of this crucial sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time that working families were rewarded. We value the family. It's time that we put that extra reward in there. It's time that second-household-income earners, who are usually women, are encouraged, rather than discouraged. That's the current set of arrangements engineered by Prime Minister Morrison. It's time that second-household-income earners are encouraged to work more and contribute to our economic recovery after the pandemic. It's time to fix the coalition's broken childcare system.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Ronald Bartsch of Cheltenham has been appointed as Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to aviation law, safety and compliance. Professor Bartsch is considered one of the world's leading experts on aviation law and aviation safety. He's been a barrister and a lecturer in law for over 25 years, and, as managing director and chairman of Avlaw Aviation Consulting International, he works with almost 100 specialist aviation consultants and lawyers across the Asia-Pacific.

Graham has been a fixture on Australian radio and television for four decades. He's been a presenter on television shows, including <span style="font-style:italic;">Better Homes and Gardens</span>, and runs <span style="font-style:italic;">The Garden Clinic</span> on 2GB. He operates Ross Garden Tours, a local family-operated garden tour company, which is one of the best in Australia. Starting as a teacher at Ryde TAFE, he has been a passionate advocate for horticulture and for young people choosing careers in gardening. I particularly think of the work that he's done through the Australian Garden Council. He's also a major identity in the Beecroft community, always finding ways to contribute, not just nationally but locally as well. Today I acknowledge the immense contribution Graham has made to horticulture.</span>

Mrs McCrindle was one of the founders of Pacific Hills Christian School, one of the great schools in my electorate. She worked as a teacher there from 1979 and was on the board of the school until 2018. She has been a volunteer with Christian Missions International and is on the international management committee. Mrs McCrindle has also been a volunteer with the West Pennant Hills Community Church for over 50 years and has been a volunteer with Crossroads since 1996.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  The Order of Australia is a truly great honour for Australians who are committed to serving their communities, but I'm quick to point out that there are many Australians who have not yet been awarded the Order of Australia who are incredibly committed to our community. I encourage those Australians out there that when you know a good Aussie who is doing a brilliant thing for our community and for our country, to nominate them. The Northern Territory has the smallest population for any Australian jurisdiction, with just under a quarter of a million residents, so I'm very proud to pay tribute to the wonderful Territorians who have been acknowledged for their hard work in our community on the Australia Day Honours list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hon. Trevor Riley, QC, is now an Officer of the Order of Australia. He is a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. His legal career has spanned almost 50 years. He worked on the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which, of course, is important work as we reflect today upon the efforts that are still required to close the gap. During his tenure as chief justice he was outspoken on such issues as alcohol abuse, high imprisonment rates and cuts to legal aid. He's made a colossal contribution, and Territorians are very thankful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also a newly appointed AO is Professor Alan Cass, Director of the Menzies School of Health Research. I spoke with Alan at a breakfast we had just the other day for the anniversary of the Apology to the Stolen Generations. He's a kidney specialist and he's doing amazing work to get better health outcomes, particularly for the First Australians. Unfortunately, the NT has some of the highest rates of kidney failure in the world, so Professor Cass's work is literally life-saving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His colleague Professor Amanda Jane Leach has now been awarded an AM. She is doing fantastic work in fighting an ear infection which causes long-term hearing loss in First Nation's kids. When you consider that hearing loss in children often leads to less-than-great outcomes at school—dropping out of school et cetera—then this work that Professor Leach is doing is so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Long-time and recently retired Katherine mayor, Fay Miller, has done tremendous work for her community. A member of the other side of politics, Fay has been a tireless advocate for Katherine for more than 30 years, including as deputy opposition leader in the NT legislative assembly. She has faced down huge obstacles, such as breaking her neck and rebuilding her home twice after the flooding that went through Katherine over the years. So I send a heartfelt and very apolitical thank you to Fay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Chief Magistrate of the NT, Hugh Bradley, was also honoured this year for his service to the law and the judiciary—well done, Hugh. David Watters was honoured for his service to law enforcement in the NT. Thank you, David, very much for your service. And congratulations to the Hagan family of Tennant Creek and also a special shout out to Katie Woolf of Mix104.9 FM, who I speak with regularly on-air. She is a great voice for our community, speaking truth to power. She has also positively channelled her grief from losing her father six years ago to prostate cancer. She started the NT Run with Dad charity to raise community awareness about prostate cancer. She's a top Territorian and so well done, Katie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As is David Dinh, who received a medal for his service to the NT Vietnamese community. On the weekend I went to the Tet celebration for the new year, which is a fantastic event. Good on you, David—we're much better off in our community for your excellent contribution. And you grow delicious mangoes! Well done, mate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Carley Scott is CEO of Equatorial Launch Australia. ELA is doing fantastic work out in East Arnhem Land for the growing space industry there. Getting NASA rockets launched from a spaceport in the outback is fantastic work—keep it up Carley! And, lastly, but very importantly, I want to pay tribute to our Public Service medallists. There is a Jodie Ryan, a long-term public servant in the Northern Territory—well done—and our Chief Health Officer, Hugh Heggie. He is doing a fantastic job with our COVID response, which has seen the Territory not have one community transmission so far. Well done, Hugh Heggie, and well done to those great Territorians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  I would like to thank my colleague, the member for Berowra, for putting forward this motion to recognise the men and women who were awarded an Order of Australia honour on Australia Day this year. On behalf of my community of Lindsay I would like to take this opportunity to celebrate the awards to people across our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Bravery at its best' is how the Royal Australian Navy characterised the actions taken by Leading Seaman Steven Palu, CSM, of Glenmore Park. In August 2017, Australian Clearance Diving Team 1 was called on to recover three missing United States marines from the wreckage of an MV-22 Osprey—a military aircraft. In what was a demanding and hazardous dive, the efforts of Leading Seaman Palu in overcoming a challenging environment and malfunctioning equipment guaranteed the return of the body of a marine to the grieving family. He said, 'We had a job and we got it done.' But this was no ordinary job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Royal Australian Navy notes that no Australian clearance diver has recovered human remains from a ditched aircraft at that depth in recent history. Leading Seaman Palu was awarded a Conspicuous Service Medal, citing his meritorious devotion to duty. Leading Seaman Palu's devotion to duty is unquestionable, as is his courage, determination and dedication. This truly was bravery at its best and I congratulate Leading Seaman Palu on his recognition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also receiving recognition on Australia Day this year was Mr Shaun Danby, ACM, of Kingswood. Shaun started with the Department of Juvenile Justice in New South Wales as a vocational instructor back in 1996. Since 2017 he has been the Corrective Services Industries Operations Manager, leading a team on construction, emergency and urgent building and maintenance works. Shaun develops inmates through managing, coaching, instructing and encouraging the members of his team to help improve their skills and experience, helping them to get a job after their release and to become productive members of the community. Shaun's citation notes that he is, 'a selfless and committed leader, and his dedication is exemplary'. Typical of the humble fashion in which he goes about his work, Shaun attributed his success to his team but it is appropriate that he has been recognised with the Australian Corrections Medal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Eric Easterbrook, OAM, of Emu Plains received the Medal of the Order of Australia for services to the community, particularly to war widows and their families. Eric served our country in the Royal Australian Air Force for 20 years before serving as a public servant for another 22. As the Vice-Chairman of Legacy Australia, Eric is an integral part of Legacy's efforts to support the families and loved ones of Australian Defence Force members who gave their lives, or who helped during or after their service to our nation. Eric has done all of what the member for Berowra notes as 'a range of fields of service to our community'. He is a member of Legacy, a volunteer for the Uniting Church, a leader of the Emu Plains Lions Club and a member of local sports, including Emu Plains Soccer Club and the Little Athletics. He was a volunteer with Blaze Aid and with National Parks and Wildlife Service NSW—so much for our community. I was proud to meet Eric last year and talk about the work he was doing in our community in encouraging younger people to take part.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Warrant Officer Christopher William Rohweder, CSM, of Glenmore Park was awarded a Conspicuous Service Medal. He was recognised for his meritorious achievement in the training and development of the Australian Defence Force Explosive Ordnance Disposal Remediation Program. He is known for being an outstanding professional who displays exceptional dedication to duty. His development of innovative assessment and instructional tools, subject matter expertise and professional work ethic were crucial to achieving a successful trial of the new course, that has delivered improved training outcomes, and a number of resource efficiencies that have advanced defence capability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so proud to represent the people of Lindsay. We are all proud of our community and what it has achieved—particularly to have Leading Seaman Steven Palu, CSM; Mr Shaun Danby, ACM; Mr Eric Easterbrook, OAM; and Warrant Officer Christopher William Rohweder, CSM, as members of our community. They truly are outstanding citizens. I am particularly pleased about the work that is being done to encourage younger people in our community to serve as well. I congratulate all of them on their Australia Day honours and look forward to their ongoing contributions to our community of Lindsay.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms VAMVAKINOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  [by video link] I would like to thank the member for Berowra for introducing this private members' motion to the House, which gives me the opportunity to speak about three of my local constituents who received Australia Day honours this year. Our Order of Australia awards recognise those who give extraordinary service to Australia. I certainly know how important they are to the recipients, their families and their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to begin my congratulating Greenvale resident Michael Panormitis Pakakis, AM, Member of the Order of Australia, who was recognised for significant service to STEM education in Victoria. Michael is the director of the Victorian Space Science Education Centre at Strathmore Secondary College and works closely with the education heads of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to develop STEM teaching resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael is a child of the post-Second World War nation-building migration program. His parents migrated to Australia from the island of Rhodes in Greece when he was 13 months old. In fact, Michael and I may have come to Australia in the same year. Certainly, our families came here for similar reasons: a better future for their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an only child, Michael spent many hours watching science fiction TV series and reading. Both parents were at work, his mother a seamstress and his father a toolmaker. This is a very familiar migrant story. Michael had an interest in science and recalls that on the day the Americans landed on the moon, 20 July 1969—who could forget that?—he told his dad that he wanted to do something related to science. He loved acquiring knowledge but he also wanted to impart this knowledge, so he became a teacher. Michael has been teaching since 1985. Reflecting on his service and contribution, Michael says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">During my first years in teaching, I taught disadvantaged kids from migrant and refugee backgrounds, often with poor English and learning difficulties. I used to tell them that I am a migrant too and they can achieve anything they dream of, if they put some effort in. I wanted to be a role model for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael's motto is one that NASA instils in its astronauts: 'Failure is not an option. Perseverance is the only option.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Greenvale resident Mrs Samia Baho, OAM, received a Medal of the Order of Australia for services to refugee welfare for the African community of Victoria. Samia came to Australia as an Eritrean refugee 30 years ago. She too shares the enduring story of refugee settlement in Australia. From an early age she had to overcome challenges by being resourceful and visionary. She spoke seven languages and quickly learned English, and she went on to obtain a social work degree, a master's degree and a postgraduate diploma in women's health at the University of Melbourne, as well as a certificate in cultural practice, law and health at La Trobe University. Samia became the founding member of the Centre for African Australian Women's Issues. Her experience of being a refugee has pretty much shaped her advocacy work and drives her determination to help those refugees who come here. She has led on issues related to racism and sexism, working to ensure that there are appropriate and equitable services available for African women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past five years Samia has worked on projects associated with sexual and reproductive health improvement for Sahel African women and is the statewide coordinator for the Reproductive Rights Education Program. She conducts important work in addressing perceptions about African women and family violence. Samia is very passionate about helping people find a job, especially women. As she says, 'If you get employment, your life will change in a lot of aspects.' Samia has set up a specialised centre in Melbourne's west whose main goal is to help people into employment. She connects with a wide network of other services and people who are sympathetic to her cause who work together to make it happen. Samia is a great woman, and I want to congratulate her especially.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Craigieburn resident Kevin O'Neill is one of four Cricket Australia scorers who officiated for their club in Victoria's premier cricket competition to receive an OAM. Kevin is the Carlton Cricket Club's scorer and has held the first-grade scorer's chair since 1971. He has been appointed scorer in 33 test matches, 63 one-day internationals, 186 first-class matches and 39 list A matches. Since his first match, Kevin has been Carlton's first-grade scorer in 596 matches. And what a good club Carlton is! Kevin and I obviously share an association with Carlton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations, therefore, to my three constituents—Michael, Samia and Kevin. You represent the breadth of the Australian story and are rightly recognised by our Australia Day awards, and I want to congratulate you very warmly. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to recognise the following residents for their outstanding service. Emeritus Professor Wayne Sampson, AM, was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his significant service to dental education in the field of orthodontics. Professor Sampson has played a leading role in South Australia's orthodontic field since being appointed a senior registrar in orthodontics in 1975 at the Royal Adelaide Dental Hospital. Since his appointment, Professor Sampson has gone on to serve as a lecturer and senior lecturer at the University of Adelaide while assisting the dental department at the Royal Adelaide Dental Hospital in the roles of senior visiting dental specialist and senior consultant throughout the 1980s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, as a former president and longstanding member of the South Australian branch of the Australian Society of Orthodontists, Professor Sampson was awarded an honorary life membership in 2014. Currently, as the emeritus professor of orthodontics at The University of Adelaide, Professor Sampson has authored more than 70 publications in refereed journals and was presented with a Meritorious Service Award from the Australian Society of Orthodontists in 2008. Through a distinguished career, Professor Sampson has mentored and guided generations of students, not just through their degrees but well into their professional lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Roy Scragg, AM, OBE, was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his significant service to medicine, to epidemiology and to professional medical associations. A former representative of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea, Dr Scragg was a member of the House of Assembly, the Constitutional Committee, the Legislative Council and the Executive Council. For his public service, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, PNG, in 1971.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While significant, Dr Scragg's dedication to public service is only exceeded by his medical achievements. A longstanding medical professional in Papua New Guinea and in Australia, Dr Scragg has been an influential figure in the fields of medicine and epidemiology since joining the Department of Health for the Australian administration of the then Territory of Papua New Guinea in 1947. Following his tenure as director of the department, Dr Scragg went on to become a foundation Professor of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Papua New Guinea in 1970 and served as a founding member and president of both the Australian Society for Epidemiology and Research into Community Health—now the Australian Epidemiological Association—and the Australian Public Health Association, which is now the Public Health Association of Australia. Dr Scragg's achievements in these fields have earned him a life membership of the Australasian Epidemiological Association in 2012 and an honorary doctorate from The University of Adelaide in 2014.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The following local residents were awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia in the 2021 Australia Day Honours List. Ms Fiona Thomson, OAM, was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for her service to youth through Girl Guides and to academic librarianship within the University of South Australia and the late Mr Douglas Robert Scott, OAM, was awarded for his service to the community through a range of roles.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to recognise Detective Superintendent Kym Hand, APM, who was awarded the Australian Police Medal for his significant service within South Australia Police. Detective Superintendent Hand has served in South Australia Police since 1977, with a focus on leadership and criminal investigation roles while bringing significant reforms into the police force. This includes leading projects which implemented the deployment of portable fingerprint scanners, mobile computing and mobile automated number plate recognition. Additionally, the detective superintendent was also the officer in charge of the further development of firearms regulations in 2017.</span>

Thank you all so very much for your outstanding commitments and your efforts, both within your professions and as volunteers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:22</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Berowra for bringing this motion forward today. It is certainly a true privilege to receive an Order of Australia award. These awards recognise local people who have demonstrated outstanding service or an exceptional achievement during the year. Often they are the quiet achievers of our community who are doing their bit every day to help our community and to give back, never wanting or expecting anything from it. This year we have seen even more why these people are so special. I am always delighted to have an opportunity to celebrate people like this in our community on the New South Wales South Coast and I want to take the time now to thank each and every local recipient for the work they do every day in our community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Robert Constable, AM, of Kangaroo Valley became a Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to music education, to performance and to composition. Dr Michael McDonald, OAM, of Gerroa, received the Medal of the Order of Australia for his service to the Catholic Church and to the community. The Reverend Dr John Pender, OAM, of Berry, received the Medal of the Order of Australia for his service to the Uniting Church in Australia and to education. Mrs Merrin Ross, OAM, of North Nowra, received the Medal of the Order of Australia for her service to the performing arts—particularly to musical theatre. And Mrs Julie Sydenham, OAM, of Milton, received the Medal of the Order of Australia for her service to the creative arts. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all these amazing community members, and congratulations on this magnificent achievement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The meritorious service awards hold a special significance this year after our community's experience during 2019-2020 bushfires. All of our frontline workers deserve our praise and recognition for the work they did, but I am thrilled to congratulate some special members of our local emergency services who received special recognition in this year's awards. Chief Inspector Peter Volf, APM, from Moruya, received the Australian Police Medal for his years of work and leadership in the New South Wales police force, including during the Tathra bushfires in 2018, and for his work as local emergency operations controller during the 2019-20 far South Coast bushfires. Mr John Dun, AFSM, of West Nowra, a stalwart of Fire and Rescue New South Wales, received the Australian Fire Service Medal. Captain Dennis Stannard, AFSM, of Sussex Inlet, received the Australian Fire Service Medal for his dedication to the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, including as a heavy plant supervisor, sector commander and divisional commander during the recent Currowan bushfires. I would like to make a special mention of Captain Stannard for his role in successfully rescuing two firefighters from an overturned fire tanker during the unprecedented bushfire in Conjola on New Year's Eve 2019 in what were extremely dangerous and difficult conditions. Thank you, Captain Stannard. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Coast is also extremely proud of the locals who received recognition as part of the Order of Australia's military division this year. Congratulations and thank you to these recipients. Lieutenant Commander Daniel Hodgkinson, CSM, of Vincentia, received the Conspicuous Service Medal for his meritorious devotion to duty as the head of officer initial training at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Creswell</span> and as the executive officer of the Royal Australian Naval College. Lieutenant Commander Hodgkinson's leadership has been described as 'tireless, flexible, influential, inclusive and inspirational'. He has been credited with making a substantial contribution to remediating the Royal Australian Navy's officer workforce shortage. Well done!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Warrant Officer William McConnell, CSM, of Cambewarra, received the Conspicuous Service Medal for his meritorious achievement in the field of Navy aviation maintenance. Warrant Officer McConnell's technical mastery was said to have been critical in overcoming the unique, complex and challenging circumstances associated with the introduction and development of the maritime support helicopter capability for the Royal Australian Navy. Once again, thank you and congratulations to all our 2021 Order of Australia and Australia Day honours recipients for your dedication and service to the people of the South Coast.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:27</span>):  I commend the member for Berowra's motion and acknowledge those outstanding individuals who joined the Order of Australia on 26 January this year. Recently I had the privilege of recognising 12 local heroes in my electorate who received an Order of Australia for their distinguished service to our community and the nation more broadly. I was delighted to recognise 11 constituents in the Ryan electorate who recently joined the general division of the Order of Australia and one who joined the military division of the Order of Australia. The first was Sue Thompson, who was awarded an OAM for her longstanding service to music education in Queensland. Sue has taught piano for 45 years and has obtained just about every honour in the music sector that you could imagine. At 94 years of age, she still teaches 10 students, who continue to excel in their studies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also Bronwyn Sheehan, the founder and CEO of the Pyjama Foundation, who was awarded the OAM for her tireless work helping the youth in our local community. Bronwyn plays an instrumental role for children in foster care. She started the Pyjama Foundation in 2004 to provide a service that could offer practical, hands-on support to foster children, which is so very important. There is Kirsty Brown, another member of my electorate, who became a Member of the Order of Australia for her significant service to our youth through Scouts Queensland. She was very humbled and honoured to be recognised for her selfless efforts this way. I know she didn't do it for the recognition but for all those scouts she has helped mentor. She has been involved in Scouts Australia for years and, whilst she has never sought recognition, she has been devoted in her service. Also among the recipients was Thomas Ryan, who received an OAM for his work in medical research and to rugby union—a talented individual across a number of jurisdictions. Finally, Warrant Officer John Franklin was added to the military division of the Order of Australia for meritorious service as a sergeant major of the band of the 1st Regiment in the Royal Australian Artillery. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very privileged to commend such worthy individuals from the Ryan electorate to the House today. It is people like Sue, Bronwyn, Kirsty, Thomas and John, who sacrifice an enormous amount of time and energy, that make Australia and the Ryan electorate such a fantastic place to live. It is their contribution to the local community and recognising it that will inspire others to step up and lead by example, just as they have done. It is so important to recognise our local heroes, whether it be through the OAM process or just in general. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year it is important to recognise the other local heroes—those who have worked on the COVID-19 vaccine at The University of Queensland. Although a vaccine hasn't come out of their work, they worked tirelessly day in, day out, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, particularly through the Christmas period, to produce their very best work on behalf of Australians. I thank all of those involved in The University of Queensland research and all of those from the Ryan electorate who received honours in the Australia Day list.</span>
