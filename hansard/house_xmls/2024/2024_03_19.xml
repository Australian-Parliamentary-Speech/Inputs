                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report considers a proposal referred in November 2023 from Airservices Australia for its per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances remediation of a former fire-training ground at Launceston Airport, Tasmania. The total cost of the proposed project is $24.01 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known collectively—and thankfully!—as PFAS, are a group of over 4,000 human-made chemicals which have been found to be harmful to the environment and to human health. Until approximately 2010 to 2011, aviation rescue and firefighting services provided at airports such as Launceston used aqueous firefighting foam containing PFAS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A detailed site investigation and previous studies commissioned by Airservices Australia have since identified PFAS in the soil, the sediment and the groundwater at Launceston Airport with concentrations above relevant guidelines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This project will remediate contamination resulting from historic firefighting training operations at Launceston Airport. Reducing the PFAS levels will minimise the risks to the environment and human health.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts, which acts as the regulatory office for leased federal airports, considers the proposed works essential. Without this project, PFAS contamination will migrate from the source area to the broader airport precinct, neighbouring properties and nearby waterways. Elevated concentrations of PFAS have already been detected several kilometres from the site. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The works aim to remediate 90 per cent of the estimated PFAS mass residing in the soil and sediment on the site. The remediation will also address the environmental remediation order that was issued on 30 March 2023 by the airport environment officer.</span>

A key principle of this agreement is that governments will cooperate to 'deliver a more effective, proportionate and efficient response, especially where contamination crosses jurisdictional boundaries'. The committee has suggested in its report that Airservices continue to engage with key Tasmanian stakeholders throughout the remediation period and beyond, particularly state and local government, to ensure the remedial works reduce risks to the surrounding land.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  It goes without saying in this chamber that we are indeed living in dangerous times. The government has said as much over the last year in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">strategic review</span> and on other occasions. The strategic order that we have enjoyed since the end of the Second World War has broken down into disorder. We see this in the South China Sea, we see it in the Red Sea, we see it in Israel and Gaza, and we see it in Ukraine. It's the authoritarian powers which are the source of this strategic disorder. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last couple of years, Australia has had to rethink our defence posture, to build our capacity to deter an adversary but also maintain our edge in a war-fighting scenario. It is why the former coalition government moved to acquire nuclear powered submarines through AUKUS, and that was supported by the Labor Party. Last year the Albanese government selected the Virginia class submarines and, as I said, AUKUS as the optimal pathway moving forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we are debating legislation to enable AUKUS. It's about executing the plan and building out the legislative framework that will bring pillar I and pillar II of AUKUS to life. It's about building a uniform system of export controls and offences across our three countries—the US, the UK and Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation we pass today will interact directly with the United States and the law that was passed in congress last year on 15 December 2023. The 2024 National Defense Authorization Act is hugely significant for Australia. Much of the public missed it, but I just want to restate exactly what that act means for Australia. It established a national exemption for Australia and the UK from US defence export licensing and adds Australia and the UK to the Defense Production Act. Specifically, it authorises the transfer of three Virginia class submarines to Australia. It also authorises the maintenance of US nuclear submarines in Australia, which is a critical part of the Optimal Pathway and of establishing Submarine Rotational Force - West. It has implications for small to medium enterprises, particularly in Perth, who not only will be part of the supply chain and deep sustainment of our US and UK partners but also will include our submarines when they pass into our hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDAA authorises Australian contractors to train in US shipyards to support the development of Australia's submarine industrial base. I know the Deputy Prime Minister would be watching that closely as we send over industry workers and APS and ADF personnel to understand the very complex system that is a US shipyard. It also establishes a mechanism for the US to accept funds from Australia to lift the capacity of the US industrial base, particularly their shipyards, which will increase the submarine delivery cadence, which is below two, to above two. If AUKUS is going to be realised, those submarines need to be popping out at a higher rate than two per year, and the funding to the US helps them to scale up and improve their efficiency in their shipyards. The NDAA also gives Australia a national exemption from US export control licensing requirements, enabling the free flow and transfer of controlled goods and technology between our three countries, enabling pillar II particularly. It will increase the speed of foreign military sales and exports not covered by the national exemption. Finally, it adds Australia and UK to title 3 of the US Defence Production Act, opening new opportunities for Australian small to medium enterprises as the US production base expands. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here's the catch: section 1343 of the National Defence Authorisation Act requires that within 120 days the US President determine and certify in writing Australia has (1) implemented a system of export controls comparable to the US and (2) implemented comparable exemption from their export controls of the USA. The Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill 2023 and the Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill 2023 establish that comparable export control system, which is a really important signal we can send to the Americans that we're taking this seriously and that we're building uniformity into our system. Now, not only did this involve us accelerating these bills through the PJCIS for the Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill 2023, but it also accelerated the Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill 2023 through the Senate Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee. I commend Senator Fawcett for the work that he did collaborating with his Labor colleagues in that committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the children sitting up there in the gallery, this is very significant today. We are passing legislation that will bring nuclear-powered submarines to our country. But it's more than just the submarines. It's a massive national endeavour. We're going to rebuild our Australian industrial base. The jobs of the future are going to be incredible for young Australians, whether they're serving in uniform, whether they're supporting industry or whether they start a small to medium or large business of their own that supports our submarines, and of course there will be plenty of jobs in government to make sure this happens. These bills implement the export control regime that is required by Congress. It means that President Joe Biden—kids, you've seen him on the TV!—will be able to sign off and say that Australia met its obligations through this parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I do want to raise that there were concerns with academic and defence industry stakeholders. They have expressed concerns about the regulatory burden and the unintended consequences of these bills, but they appreciate that, in the national interest, we need to move quickly. This year is a big year for Australia, for the US and for the UK. We know there is a presidential election in November. Who knows when the election will be held here—potentially in November. We'll be ready regardless. Of course, we can expect an election in the UK no later than January next year. It is important we establish this export control regime in Q1 and Q2 of this year. It looks like we're going to get there, working on a bipartisan basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge Ambassador Kennedy and Ambassador Rudd, who provided briefings to the opposition on this. That was helpful as we considered this. During the committee process in the Senate, we were very glad to have received the recommendations that there will be a statutory review within three years of the Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill 2023 and that industry working groups established by Defence will be used for the codesign of the regulations as well as the transition and implementation of the regime. And, finally, we're very glad that the membership of the defence industry working groups will be expanded to include Australian owned small- to medium-sized enterprises, which are uncertain about how this will play out and which will also feel the bumps and bruises as we work our way through this. It's important that they have a voice on the industry working group, as they will be most sensitive to the changes, and I'm glad that the government has accepted that recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should also note that the Deputy Prime Minister is committed to establishing a joint statutory committee on defence. This has been a long-term project for parliamentarians from both sides. On our side, I acknowledge Senator Linda Reynolds, Senator David Fawcett and the late Senator Jim Molan, who have advocated for this for some years. In the wake of the Brereton inquiry I said that this is a missing piece of institutional architecture. I think that when Australians go to war we should all support our troops in the field, but there should be a forum where we can ask hard questions of our generals—particularly on strategy and operations. I think that's the missing piece.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think as well that this sends a signal to the US and to the UK, as we go forward with AUKUS, that we're serious about ensuring that we hold defence accountable—that we ask the right questions but that we do it behind closed doors. That's because our adversaries are watching and are looking for any cleavage they can find. We're seeing that right now in the media, with a former prime minister doing his best to undermine the AUKUS agreement. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his willingness to move at speed on this. I also note, of course, the member for Bruce and his work through the war powers inquiry into international armed conflict decision-making and his recommendation for the establishment of a joint committee on defence. If I can be so bold, I see this as being a comparable committee to the PJCIS: it would be bound by secrecy provisions, include parties of government and sensible people, and be a training ground for people who might one day serve as defence minister. I think that would be a really important development for a lot of parliamentarians who care about our troops and want to see the best for them. Once again, I'm looking forward to seeing that legislation when it comes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to mention a few things relating to AUKUS—and thank you for attending the chamber, Deputy Prime Minister; it's a good opportunity for me to mention them! I want to highlight a few things that I think are of concern about Submarine Rotational Force West. We know that the plan to upgrade HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span> doesn't begin until 2025, so timings are tight, and I urge the government to move at best speed to make that happen. I'm also concerned about the housing shortage in WA. Many of us across the country feel the housing shortage; it's acute. But, if we're going to have US and UK families coming to WA, it's going to be even more acute. We talk about 'social licence' for nuclear powered submarines; I think there's also a social licence required for foreign personnel living alongside Australians, particularly when there's an existing housing shortage. I know that local governments are quick and very keen to sign off on development approvals, and they need leadership from the state government. We need to get more houses built at speed so that we can welcome our friends when they come in 2027.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue that has been raised with me is that the top two occupations of US military spouses are nursing and teaching. Nurses and teachers: we have a shortage of those in this country and their accreditation is not recognised in Australia, so when they post it will be hard for them to find work. But we need more nurses in WA and we need more teachers. New Zealand recognises those professions, and so I'd encourage the government, through whatever mechanism, to see how we can enable families who are posted here to get involved in our economy, particularly in those two areas of health and education, where we have large shortages at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want the government to think about an AUKUS visa. I think that's a really important part of this. We need to be able not only to move technology and equipment quickly between our three countries—and the intellectual property, capital and everything that goes with it—but we also need to move people fairly quickly. So we need people who have visas and recognition of their security clearances. I think those are things that we should pay close attention to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to mention the recruitment and retention crisis in the ADF. We know the ADF is below strength. We know we're not hitting the targets. Deputy Prime Minister, we want to see more people in uniform serving our country. AUKUS is a great opportunity, kids, so keeping looking up there. You are the future of this country. I benefited greatly from an education in the Australian Defence Force, just over the road at the Defence Force Academy. At every opportunity I get to speak to high-school students, I mention the opportunities that will come with AUKUS. The message has to be one of service, one of opportunity and one of aspiration, and we need to get cracking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I'm glad we could get this done. I look forward to working to make sure that our Navy personnel and the Australian people have everything they need in the years ahead. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265585" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  I can make it clear that both the Nationals and Liberals will be opposing the tax in the Agriculture (Biosecurity Protection) Levies Bill 2024 and related bills. This is a tax. What we are doing is going to tax Australian farmers to pay for the biosecurity cost of their foreign competitors bringing product to Australia to compete with Australian farmers on the supermarket shelves in this country. In what parallel universe does a government charge its own farmers to help their foreign competitors bring product to this country? It makes no sense. This is a direct assault not just on Australian agriculture but on Australian families. In the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, when food has already gone up over nine per cent, this government is going to make Australian produce even more expensive. They are going to tax farmers for that biosecurity cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our biosecurity system needs to be robust. On our side we have a proud history. The former coalition government spent over $1 billion in strengthening those borders to make sure that we didn't just protect Australian agricultural production systems but protected the natural environment as well. But what we need to do is move to a model that actually charges those that pose the biosecurity risks to this country. What we are saying is that there are risks posed by foreign importers that don't have the biosecurity standards that we have and that have many of the pests and diseases that we don't have in this country. They can bring their product to this country and the good old Australian farmer's going to pay for it, but that has to be passed on. That has to be passed on to the Australian consumer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian farmers already pay over $500 million a year in levies. There are levies for research and development but also for biosecurity support, particularly in cases of incursion, to Plant Health Australia and Animal Health Australia. Part of that $500 million already goes to a biosecurity system, and this government is now going to ask them to pay for someone else's. The government should understand that, when we export—and we export $80 billion worth of agricultural production around the world—to other countries and those products need to be processed through the border, we pay for that. We pay for the cost and the risk that we pose to their biosecurity system. But for some reason this government has decided to charge Australian farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad indictment on this is that the last order I gave as the Australian agriculture minister in March 2022 was for the department to finalise the consultation process with importers about a cost-recovery model. That cost-recovery model would mean that they would pay a container levy of somewhere between $20 and $25 a container. That's not about us trying to make a profit out of importers. Under WTO rules we had to be able to clearly identify the cost imposed by biosecurity at our borders in processing those containers and, again, a different cost-recovery model for bulk commodities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, in the last consultation piece we had with industry they were quite eager for this. They wanted an efficient biosecurity system at the border because we were holding them up. They needed to have the funds there to be able to fund that biosecurity system. Otherwise, having these boats sitting out there, bobbing around, waiting to be unloaded and reloaded, costs them about $140,000 a day. They were quite eager to see that the department of agriculture had an efficient, properly funded biosecurity system at the border.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be funded by the simple principle that those who pose the risk should pay the cost. But this government has deviated from that and is now going to charge Australian farmers. It was so bad. The fact was that the incoming minister would have had an incoming minister's brief from the department saying that this was the model—a cost-recovery model—that was ready to be implemented. In fact, it was to be implemented in MYEFO in December 2022, straight after the election. But the new minister has obviously gone against the brief of the work that the department had done and has come up with his own ideological view of charging Australian farmers on their research and development levies. With that $500 million a year, he came up with the grand idea of a 10 per cent levy on those levies every year. That's double dipping, because in that $500 million are biosecurity costs that farmers are already charged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of this government deciding to blow this all up and put the cost back on Australian farmers, there was a sensible alternative that would not mean that farmers would have to pass this on and, in fact, drive up the cost at the check-out. The government, in its wisdom, has now even moved away from the path they were going to go down, of the 10 per cent levy on the R&amp;D levies. Now they're going on the gross value of each commodity over a three-year period, meaning some commodities will pay a significant amount and some commodities will pay nothing. It should come back to the simple principle that those who pose the risk pay the cost of the biosecurity. This is a principle that this government has thrown out for reasons no-one can understand, in any ideological view, other than that they don't understand agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian farmers have felt under siege from this government from the very beginning. The Prime Minister said that no-one will be left behind and everyone will get a go. Well, unfortunately, if you live in regional Australia you've missed out. In their first budget they not only changed the biosecurity levy but took $27 billion worth of infrastructure out of it. Roads and rail are important arterial infrastructure that get product from a paddock to your plate or, importantly, to a port that pays the bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They banned the live export of sheep, with no scientific or economic reason, and walked away from an industry that creates 3,000 jobs in Western Australia. They removed nearly $100 million of export income to this country with the stroke of a pen—without even having the courage of their conviction to turn up and face the Western Australian farmers and export industry, to look them in the eye and tell them, 'These are the scientific and economic reasons why.' But they don't have reasons. We have the best animal welfare standards in the world. Sadly, what will happen is that that decision will have a perverse animal welfare outcome—not here in Australia, but around the world—because the countries that will take up that market, that we are signing ourselves out of, don't have the animal welfare standards that we do. So you will see a perverse outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also seen the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. They've reshaped the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. They've walked away from the very plan that they implemented. They're now changing the rules to take an extra 450 gigalitres of water. They've taken away the restrictions that we put in place around water buybacks. Water buybacks don't hurt the farmer; they hurt the small community that's left behind: the machinery dealer, the pump shop, the agronomist, right through to the cafe, because the economic value of that community is lost. But they've taken away 450 gigalitres of extra water—that's a Sydney Harbour every year. They've taken away the tools that farmers need to produce our food and fibre, taken away our food security and driven up your food prices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then it gets worse, looking at the vehicle emissions that this government wants to bring in, taking away the tools of trade that we need in regional Australia. The only electric ute available is $92,000, but the big kicker is that it can only go 150 kilometres. Now, where I come from, on some properties they wouldn't even get to the front gate before they'd need to recharge. This is the insanity of what this government is imposing on Australian agriculture. But this biosecurity tax, this fresh food tax, is also a kicker to Australian families. I implore the government to go back to the drawing board. The work has been done. The department has done the consultation. We can introduce a container levy on importers, we can get a cost recovery model on bulk importers and we can make sure that there is a properly funded biosecurity model in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, another big kicker is that the money they're raising out of this doesn't even go back into biosecurity programs but to consolidated revenue. So, how does Australian agriculture have confidence that this government is going to continue the legacy that we put in place of over $1 billion for protecting our biosecurity borders? And that was with technology, with boots on the ground, with dogs on the ground—making sure that, whether it was a container or people through a port, the protections were put in place to protect our environment and protect Australian agriculture. Whatever reason it was that this government changed their mind, it is one they can't explain, because they still haven't completed the model on how they're going to charge this and how much will be paid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has an opportunity to pause, plan and go back and get this right. If they don't, this cost will be passed on to the Australian consumer. It is something that any government would think differently about if they understood the pressures Australian families are under every day. Families are going to the supermarket every week and making real-life decisions about what they take off the shelf and what they put back on it because they can't afford it. All we will do today is drive up that cost of fresh produce at those supermarkets, where those families, when they walk in there, will make those tough decisions, because it will be more expensive, when it didn't need to be—a senseless decision by a government that doesn't understand agriculture. And when you don't understand agriculture, every Australian pays.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And every Australian is about to pay for the actions of this government, which has ignored the calls of over 50 industry groups that had the temerity to write to the Prime Minister and implore him to go back to the model that was proposed before the election and that importers were happy with and exporters were happy with, and we had a properly funded biosecurity system. Instead, in pure arrogance, they have ignored farmers, ignored farming groups. But one thing this government has done for Australian agriculture that I must congratulate the minister for is that finally one minister has united all industry groups in their hatred of one force: the Albanese government.

Overall, it has our support because we believe the amendments outlined in this legislation are sensible, responsible and practical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will help ensure the Primary Industries Research and Development Act 1989 is modernised, upgraded and fit for purpose while also repealing an act that is no longer needed. From the outset, when it comes to the Primary Industries Research and Development Act 1989, it's important to recognise the major role it has within the Australian primary production sector. The purpose of this act is to authorise and regulate four of our rural research and development corporations—or RDCs, as they're known. For more than three decades, the RDCs, which include fisheries, cotton, grain and agrifutures, have driven forward evidence based innovation, boosted strategic partnerships and helped secure targeted investments in each of their respective industries. They allow the federal government and primary producers to co-invest in collective efforts to benefit not just the entire industry but many communities throughout rural, regional and remote Australia. Therefore, it's essential our RDCs operate as effectively as possible, and the measures in this bill will help do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Significantly, this legislation will enhance the operation of the Primary Industries Research and Development Act 1989 by improving the efficiency and administrative processes which relate to its governance and appointments. Specific amendments include streamlining and clarifying the nomination of RDC board members by a selection committee, which are then recommended to the minister for agriculture. It also removes the requirement for an annual report to be provided to the minister if no activity has been undertaken by the selection committee, acknowledging the RDC meet twice annually. This bill will remove the requirement for the four statutory RDC chairpersons to have a coordination meeting each year. The coalition believes this is a sensible change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second major component of this bill includes repealing the outdated Rural Adjustment Act 1992 and making transitional provisions to allow information and documents held by the rural adjustment authority advisory council to be provided to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Given that the rule adjustment scheme ceased in 1997, all financial commitments were acquitted in 2000 and funding for the farm business improvement program ended in February 2008, repealing this act just makes sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the federal coalition supports this bill. We commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  I'll say at the outset that we will be supporting this non-controversial bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support and Family Assistance Technical Amendments) Bill 2024, and note the urgent nature of it in relation to the Child Support (Assessment) Act. We support the government in moving quickly to address concerns around this child support scheme operating as it has always been intended and the doubt cast on that as a result of a Federal Court decision following an AAT decision. In particular, we note that Services Australia identified the government concerns that the 2018 amendments to the child support and family assistance legislation were at risk, if not already, of not operating as intended, due to unclear drafting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2018 amendments had the unintentional consequence of limiting the circumstances in which interim period assessments can apply. All those in the child support agency and those who are subject to these orders understand the significant role that the interim periods play in Australia's child support scheme. In essence, these interim period arrangements encourage compliance with written care arrangements and prevent parents who withhold care of a child from benefiting through higher child support and family tax benefit payments than they should be receiving. In February this year, the Federal Court confirmed that the 2018 amendments did not operate as intended, and that has therefore led to the urgent legislative change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we will support the changes to ensure that the act continues to operate in the way that has been intended and to ultimately ensure that no benefit accrues to a party that's subject to child support arrangements but is not adhering to the requirements of those written and otherwise agreed arrangements. That plays an important role in ensuring, as far as humanly possible, adherence to child support arrangements that can often occur against the backdrop of significant rancour between parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These interim period arrangements are an important feature of the act, and we therefore provide our unequivocal support to these very technical amendments. We note they don't have a financial impact. This is ultimately just ensuring that the law, as it has always been intended to apply, continues to do so in light of the drafting concerns and, of course, in light of the recent court decisions that emphasised and highlighted the hole that potentially, if not in practice, now exists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, in that sense, wholeheartedly supports the amendments and will provide swift passage through this House.</span>

                    <a href="241067" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I rise to speak on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Community Television) Bill 2024. It is about a very important issue, which is the allocation of spectrum for community television—in particular, community television in Melbourne, Geelong and Adelaide that is broadcast under channels 31 and 44. Community television is where a lot of people get their start in the television industry, and there is a lot of important content that appears on those channels broadcast under the use of spectrum. Spectrum refers to the use of the airwaves, be it for television or indeed for mobile services that are so popular around the country. This is about how the government manages that spectrum. It's a really important issue because we have seen the minister mismanage spectrum very badly in relation to round 6 of the Mobile Black Spot Program—that notorious round where the minister personally directed which project should get funding, and in Victoria and New South Wales 100 per cent of those locations were in Labor electorates. That's one hundred per cent of the locations for which the minister directed funding as part of her allocation of spectrum—which is very relevant to today's bill. That was a shocking misuse of taxpayers' funding. That is why the Auditor-General is looking into this and doing very thorough and diligent examination of the conduct of round 6 of the Mobile Black Spot Program. We look forward to his report, which is due by May.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Spectrum is really important, and this legislation would extend the deadlines for Australia's two remaining community television stations to remain on the air using radio frequency spectrum. It would scrap the legislated expiry date of 30 June 2024 and instead give the power to the Australian Communications Media Authority—ACMA—to set a new deadline. There would be a two-stage process which would effectively provide the community television stations with 12-months notice before they would move to delivery via an online platform. Under stage 1 of the proposed changes, ACMA would determine: first, the alternative use for the spectrum, and then there would be a six-month process for ACMA to formally determine this declared use. Under the second stage, once the determination had been made, it would be up to ACMA to set a date for when the licenses for the use of that spectrum would expire. The decision on that date would be via a disallowable legislative instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a number of extensions to the spectrum before—the most recent was in 2021. I would say that the government has taken a long time to address this issue—it has been almost two years since it was elected. It has been absorbed in other issues such as the Voice debate and other issues last year, and this could have been dealt with a lot earlier. But, given that deadline of expiration is almost upon us, the government is now acting. The coalition won't be standing in the way of passage of this bill and will support it. We would have liked to have seen the government deal with this issue more quickly and in a more competent fashion, but we will not oppose this legislation and will support its passage through the House. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  The last annual report tabled before the Attorney announced his attack on the AAT, the 2021-22 annual report tells the story of a body meeting or exceeding its benchmarks. The user satisfaction rate to 30 June 2022 was 74 per cent, above the target of 70 per cent. That is quite extraordinary when you remember that the users are the people who bring a case before the AAT and who, in many cases, will be dissatisfied with the final result of their case. It continued to outperform that target in the 2022-23 financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now let's look at some of the other measures of the tribunal's performance. In relation to the decision-making quality, the 2021-22 proportion of appeals allowed by courts was below the benchmark of five per cent. In that same year, just 1.3 per cent of appeals were allowed from all appealable decisions. To put it more concretely, in 98.7 per cent of cases that went before the AAT in that year the matter was resolved in the way that the AAT said it should be resolved. It continued to outperform that target in the 2022-23 financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to transparency, in the final year to 30 June 2022, the AAT exceeded its performance benchmark of 5,000 decisions published. It continued to exceed that benchmark in the 2022-23 financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of clearance ratio, in the 2021-22 financial year, the AAT fell just short of its target primarily due to jump in post-COVID lodgements. Having been at a 119 per cent clearance ratio before the year 2021-22, it subsequently dropped to 95 per cent in the face of a sudden surge in lodgements. The number of lodgements dropped off significantly in 2022-23, and the AAT is back to the position of finalising more cases that are lodged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of output, which means the number of AAT applications and referrals finalised, in the year 2021-22, the AAT reached 90 per cent of its target. This was despite continued disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic such as lockdowns and other restrictions, which affected our operations in various locations during the reporting year. In 2022-23, after the pandemic, the output target was reduced, and it met the targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was by no means a perfect body, with the timeliness of the decision-making remaining a concern. As we here on this side have said, we are not opposed to improvements in this area. But these are not the performance measures of a body for which the only reasonable course of action is to abolish that body.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before concluding, it is worth putting a few things on the record in relation to the sham process that the government has adopted in relation to these bills. These three bills, the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023, the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 1) Bill 2023 and the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 2) Bill 2024, deal with a system that provides merits review under more than 400 pieces of Commonwealth legislation. There are interactions across the entire Commonwealth statute book that reach into virtually all portfolios. These changes that are being debated today impact on matters ranging from veterans' entitlements to FOI to small-business taxation and visa decisions. We are looking at 678 pages of new primary legislation, with 631 pages of explanatory material. This week, we are being asked to vote on a bill establishing an entirely new administrative review body, plus 33 schedules of amending legislation. There are consequential and transitional provisions that make changes across something like 248 Commonwealth acts, and the decisions that we make here today during this debate will directly affect 67,000 cases that are currently on foot before the AAT.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, extraordinarily, we are in a position where we are being asked to pass these measures when the government's own legislation drives home the point that we cannot be certain this legislation is right and correct. The second consequential and transitional measures bill makes changes to the ART Bill. That's right: the government has already introduced amendments to the centrepiece of its own reform efforts. It doesn't make sense. The Attorney must have been distracted when he was finalising that legislation, because, just two months after introducing his primary legislation and before a single committee hearing had taken place, he introduced changes to the bill. These changes do not go to minor, inconsequential issues; they concern the way that the tribunal will deal with preventive detention orders in terrorism cases. In effect, the Attorney-General is admitting to unforced errors. It is a powerful indication that the ART Bill was not quite right, not quite correct or not quite finished when it was introduced. This reinforces our point that you shouldn't simply wave these sorts of things through without scrutiny, because if the Attorney-General is telling us that these two swings are needed then what else has he missed?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just us saying that. Let's look at the process and how we got to this point. Shortly after Christmas, the first two bills in this package were referred to the House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, which gave stakeholders just a few short weeks—over the Christmas and New Year break, mind you—to make submissions. Many simply couldn't meet that time frame. The Law Council of Australia, Australia's premier representative body for the legal profession, had to ask for an extension. Here's what the Law Council of Australia said about the Attorney-General's abuse of the parliamentary committee process:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst the Law Council is pleased to have obtained an extension to 2 February 2024 to lodge its submission, it remains very concerned that the Committee's truncated inquiry period will undermine or diminish the democratic and proper scrutiny of the Bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General should have taken this more seriously. When the legal profession is telling him that he is undermining the democratic and proper scrutiny of these bills, that's a very serious allegation that needs to be taken notice of. The Law Council went on to dismiss any arguments about urgency:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is understood that the Commonwealth is seeking to establish the Tribunal as a priority, having first announced its intention to abolish and replace the AAT on 16 December 2022. However, the Law Council is not aware of any public commitment to establish the Tribunal by a specific date. In the circumstances, the Law Council queries why the Attorney-General has caused these significant Bills to be subject to such an expedited inquiry process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They called out the 'limited opportunity to engage comprehensively with the bills' and were forced to take the extraordinary step of saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… views in this submission must be considered preliminary and subject to change …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another point to record is that the House committee had just one hearing, for just two hours in total. The only witnesses that the committee heard from were the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Home Affairs and the Department of Social Services. That's about 40 minutes per department—work that out. Really, is that sufficient time? If you share those 40 minutes per department between the government, the opposition and the crossbench, then you get about 13 minutes on such a serious matter. That's just over six minutes per bill. The committee didn't even look at the second consequential and transitional provisions bill. It only looked at two of the three bills that they were debating on that day. Any reasonable observer, I would suggest, would tell you that the House inquiry process was a sham and should not be regarded as an adequate scrutiny process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, things are not looking much better in the Senate. You may have thought that the government would have learnt from the Law Council's warning that it was undermining the democratic and proper scrutiny of this legislation, but sadly it seems that this is far from the case. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee insisted on doing its job and set a time frame for inquiry that, firstly, would allow witnesses a number of weeks to consider and prepare submissions, would facilitate multiple committee hearings so that we as a parliament could take a proper look at whether these proposed changes work and are fit for purpose and, finally, would give the committee time to compile and finalise these reports into three separate bills and hundreds of amendments across the statute book.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney was furious about the committee doing its job, and we know this because he told us. In an answer to a dixer on 8 February, he told us how disappointed he was that the Senate committee had insisted on performing its proper functions, describing it as 'disrupt and delay tactics'. He was angry that the Senate committee had refused to be bullied into cutting short its ordinary parliamentary process. This was despite the very clear warning from the Law Council that a shoddy and rushed process risked undermining democratic and proper scrutiny of this legislation and that there was no tenable basis for a rush. But, having lost the fight on the deadline, it appears that the government wants to ensure that no hearing actually takes place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So far the government has agreed to just a single hearing, with 3½ hours for all three bills. There is every indication that all attempts to schedule future hearings will be resisted. It is worth illustrating what this means in practice, because the simple reality is that, as it stands, the coalition senators have been given just 10 minutes to ask the disability sector about these three different bills that will affect each and every one of them in the sector. The veteran sector has not been fully heard from at all. We have not heard about the FOIs. We have not heard about small business and their concerns. We have not heard from the countless other stakeholder groups who are directly affected by this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a process that is being conducted in good faith. We haven't even heard from the Law Council. We call on the government to conduct these inquiries properly and not put this to a vote until those inquiries are completed so that any vote can be informed. The Attorney-General was an advocate for transparency while he was in opposition. Now it's time for him to put that into place and into practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude that the coalition will not be supporting these bills in this place if they go to a vote this week; I can tell you that. The process has been a farce, and we are not prepared to sign off on any major reforms without appropriate scrutiny. We will reserve our position in the Senate, and I thank the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  It's quite extraordinary that a coalition member should quote with approbation the Law Council of Australia, having ignored so many submissions the Law Council of Australia made about so many bills that the opposition brought forward when they were in office. The Law Council was generally supportive, and I was on this inquiry, which was referred to by the member for Braddon, the inquiry into the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill and the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 1) Bill 2023, which was chaired so ably by Susan Templeman, the member for Macquarie. She chaired that inquiry, and there was a report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And this is not the first report; it's not the first inquiry. When those opposite were in power they engaged the Hon. Ian Callinan AC KC to complete a statutory review of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which was tabled in July 2019. That review found that the AAT was 'not always meeting community expectations, and workloads and backlogs were preventing the timely and final resolution of matters'. It made a series of recommendations, which those opposite squibbed. So, we are in a position where we're having to clean up the mess—and those opposite know this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting that the member for Braddon talks about the fact that they're going to oppose this legislation, because three members of the coalition served on the committee which recommended unanimously that this bill be passed. There was no dissenting report at all from those opposite. The coalition members of that committee were: the member for Cowper, the deputy chair; the member for Hughes; and the member for Menzies. They did put a sort of clarification at the end. They could have dissented, but they didn't dissent at all. So, this is a unanimous report that recommends that this legislation be passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation has a long history. The AAT also had some history. It was established on 1 July 1976 following reviews of administrative decision-making that took place in 1971. There was a need for a mechanism for external review of government decisions that was accessible, informal and relatively affordable. That was necessary. The Whitlam government tried to bring in this legislation. And this is one of the things that happened when Malcolm Fraser became the Prime Minister. A number of good things that were initiatives of the Whitlam Labor government were taken up by him, and one of those was the AAT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Braddon talk about how we should be concentrating on cost-of-living issues—and we are. If only those opposite had actually asked questions in question time about it, it might show that they had some veracity or truthfulness about their concern about the issue. But they haven't. The member made out in his speech today that this is something that is almost esoteric, that it doesn't affect too many people. But if you have a look at this report—and I'd refer the member to pages 4 and 5—it includes a table showing how many people affected by decisions of government sought review. For example, in 2022-23 there were 41,037 lodgements in the AAT, 42,689 finalisations and 66,131 cases still on hand. If you add those numbers together, that's far more than the number of voters in any single constituency in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of Australians are affected by decisions of government—veterans' affairs, social security, migration et cetera. They have a right to have their cases dealt with expeditiously, fairly and impartially if they feel that they haven't been treated well by government decision-making. This is not an obtuse issue. It's not an issue that doesn't affect many people. It's a lot more people than are at the MCG on a Saturday to watch Collingwood play Carlton. It's a lot more than those going to see the Broncos play the Cowboys at Lang Park. This affects a lot of Australians. So don't give us lectures saying that we're not concentrating on issues that affect Australians. We're cleaning up the mess of those opposite. And the idea that somehow this wasn't even looked at, when former Justice Callinan did a review for the previous government in 2019—we announced on 16 December 2022 that we would abolish the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and we did public consultation on this issue back in April and May of 2023. Guidance was sought from an administrative review Expert Advisory Group chaired by former High Court Justice the Hon. Patrick Keane AC KC, and it was engaged on across the government and the AAT. Consultation with a whole bunch of stakeholders was conducted in September and October 2023. So this idea that the Attorney-General went into his office and got out his laptop and started typing, or took out his pen and starting writing, without consultation with the Australian public and those people who are affected is arrant nonsense from those opposite. It is rubbish! The government has engaged in a consultation process. In addition to this, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee will be examining this bill—as they often do in the other place—and reporting in July 2024. Yet there are these ideas that we haven't looked at this bill, that it hasn't been the subject of community consultation, that somehow it doesn't affect many Australians—that it's an obtuse little issue that doesn't affect Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It affects many Australians. So I listened to the member opposite, and he was saying that it's not really a very important issue and the government should be concentrating on something else. Yet, at the same time, he talked about there being so many issues and said that we'd rushed this through, allegedly, and that it's going to affect many people. I couldn't understand the logic of those opposite; it was totally inconsistent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And have a look at this report. There are over 60 pages in this report that deals with it. The Law Council suggested some constructive defining amendments and made some important comments. Generally, the submitters in this thing talked about the failure of the AAT and the fact that it needed reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have two bills before the chamber that are absolutely critical. They'll affect a lot of Australians. Maybe those opposite don't believe that government decision-making affects Australians. But we, on this side, believe that government is a force for good, and, when it's not a force for good, Australians have the right to seek to have those decisions reviewed and for that to be dealt with in an affordable, timely and fair way. That's why this legislation before the chamber today is so important. And that's how disingenuous those opposite are about this particular issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to speak on this particular bill, because it's an important bill. We're cleaning up the mess of those opposite. You could be a failed state LNP member in Queensland or candidate for this place, or an LNP former federal MP—the AAT was a sort of retirement village, a financial retirement home, for LNP and Liberal and National Party appointees and grandees, with 85 of them appointed. Even the Leader of the Opposition at one stage talked about how politicised the AAT had become—as if they'd forgotten they'd spent nine years over here politicising it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are having to abolish the AAT and bring in a new system because it has really served its purpose and it needs major reform. Those opposite knew it because, three years before they got turfed out, they had a report that said it needed major reform—and they squibbed it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the bill implements all three recommendations from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee's report <span style="font-style:italic;">Performance and integrity of Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s administrative review system</span>; four recommendations from that royal commission that those opposite don't want to know about, the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme; and the government's response to two recommendations from the Rapid Review into the Exploitation of Australia's Visa System. So there's a long history to this matter, even before these bills have been debated. It's not true to say that all of a sudden it's come up and been foisted upon the Australian public. The bills were informed by extensive stakeholder consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problems at the AAT extend well beyond the absence of a merit based selection process under the former government. They failed. If they had stopped to think about who they had kept on appointing to the AAT, then this bill might not have been necessary. If the AAT had been managed better, this bill might not have been necessary. Many of the people appointed by those opposite had no relevant experience—no legal experience. Some of them were active lobbyists, and that was well known. We've inherited an AAT that's not on a sustainable financial footing; an AAT beset by delays, with an extraordinarily large backlog of cases and operating multiple and aging electronic case-management systems. It's the legacy of the mismanagement of those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was an amalgamation of the AAT with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. The fact that there is an inefficient administrative system of review in this country comes at a real cost for tens of thousands of Australians every year. Cumulatively, well over 100,000 Australians are dealing with this system at any given time. These Australians feel abandoned by government. That's why people feel a loss of faith in government—because of decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The robodebt royal commission noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Effective merits review is an essential part of the legal framework that protects the rights and interests of individuals; it also promotes government accountability and plays a broader important role in improving the quality and consistency of government decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite claim that they're Liberals. They should be in favour of individual liberty and the individual ability to stand up and argue a case against government. If they were truly Liberals, they'd be on the side of John Stuart Mill and those people that believe in individual liberty and want to support the little bloke or the little woman who wants to take on government decision-making. But they don't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need is a new system in this country, and we're going to have it: an administrative review tribunal bill which establishes a much-improved tribunal that's fair and just; that resolves applications in a timely way, with little legal formality and at little expense; that is accessible and responsive to needs across a broad jurisdiction of law; that improves the transparency and quality of government decision-making; and that promotes public trust. That's crucial—you must have public trust in judiciary, in executive, in government and the legislature, and in administrative law in this country. You must have it. If you don't have it, people lose faith in government. A central feature of the new body will be transparent and merit based decision-making, with the appointment of non-judicial members—in stark contrast to the LNP mates of those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years, Centre for Public Integrity board member Geoffrey Watson SC has said the damage to the AAT was too extensive to just replace the existing members over several years, so it's really necessary to start from scratch with a whole new body. That's what we found, as well—in that committee of which I am a member. Mr Watson was supportive of the government's approach and has argued that it will help restore integrity, openness and accountability and allow it to function independently of politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what has happened under those opposite. They politicised this whole process, and then they criticised it. The weird thing about it was how many times they stacked their mates on the AAT and then proceeded to criticise the decision-making that took place, on migration issues in particular, again and again. We saw it on the front page of newspapers. They'd say it publicly at press conferences. The great inconsistency: you put your mates on to get the decisions you want and you don't like the outcomes that you get.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The backlog was immense, and that's why we need to deal with it. This needs to be an ART that functions transparently and independently of politics. That's really, really important. It's important we also implement the recommendations of the royal commission into robodebt. By the way, I heard this from people over the weekend, and I heard it at my recent mobile offices. They want those recommendations of the royal commission to be carried out. People want royal commission recommendations to be carried out—just as we're doing. We've done it in terms of banking and in terms of aged care. With robodebt, it's necessary as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this legislation picks up some of those recommendations and makes sure that we carry them out. People need faith in government. They don't need letters saying you owe a lot of money to the government when you don't actually owe it. This government opposite, when they were here—the government-in-waiting, as they think they are—knew very well that robodebt was wrong and that it was unethical and illegal. They knew about it, but they didn't do anything about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're picking up recommendations from the royal commission here, and it's important that we do. That's why I'm so supportive of this legislation. Those opposite are a disgrace. They're disingenuous about this legislation. They know the system's not working. They knew it in government, they know it in opposition and they should be supporting the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:19</span>):  While I am the first woman to represent the electorate of North Sydney, I'm not the first Independent. Like many in my community, I'm proud that Ted Mack, the father of the Independent movement, once represented us. A renowned advocate for greater transparency and accountability in government, Ted famously offered the following quote:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… government should be totally open to public scrutiny and elected representatives should enable people to not only participate in all decisions that affected them, but to ultimately find ways to have people make decisions for themselves … the very basis of democracy is that a decision taken by the public as a whole would be right more often than decisions taken by an elite group …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is through this lens that, along with members of my community, I have reviewed the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023, the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 1) Bill 2023 and the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 2) Bill 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's administrative review system provides protection for individuals from unfair use of public power, and it's essential for public confidence in government. Sadly, the current Administrative Appeals Tribunal, known as the AAT, is plagued by inefficiencies and failures. After years of abuse, this package of reform provides a much-needed opportunity for the government to rebuild public confidence in this process. Theoretically, we should all welcome this reform. It is the result of long-term advocacy from many across our communities. Yet there remain inconsistencies and challenges in the package that, without change, will continue to condemn people seeking redress under the AAT for visa or citizenship issues by ensuring that they know that to be a noncitizen is to be second-class in this country. These issues could be addressed through modest changes in the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 1) Bill 2023, and these changes would strengthen the overall system by ensuring all people are treated equally under the law. For this to happen, this government must show they are prepared to do more than pay lip service to the very principles of international human rights law and show courage to lead us to a better place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For over three decades now, the mistreatment of refugees and asylum seekers in Australia has tainted our international human rights reputation. Noncitizens, including those seeking asylum, refugees and the stateless, experience structural exclusion and intersecting barriers to accessing justice immediately upon entering Australia. These barriers include the impacts of trauma, language barriers, mental health issues, financial distress and cultural differences. In the pursuit of equality before the law, any reform to the administrative review in our country must account for this and ensure all applicants can equally access a fair and just review process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While these bills have the potential to pave the way for a fairer and more efficient operation of Australia's administrative review system, in their current form they do not achieve that outcome. There are positive changes to be welcomed in them. They include the implementation of an independent merit based process for appointment and reappointment of members; the re-establishment of the Administrative Review Council; and the abolishment of the Immigration Assessment Authority and the fast-track process. In particular, the implementation of an independent merit based process for appointment and reappointment of members is welcome, as the previous process had become highly politicised, with the governmental politics of the day exerting far too strong an influence on the decisions of those appointed to the AAT. In fact, data from the Kaldor Centre Data Lab reveals the policies of the political party of government at the time a tribunal member was first appointed to the AAT had a significant effect on the outcomes of their decision-making in protection visa cases in particular. Ultimately, the new system should encourage applicants who have the relevant knowledge, skills and expertise for such a position to apply with confidence, knowing that any lack of party connections will not be a hindrance to their potential employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Complementing this reform is the introduction of the Administrative Review Council. This body will contribute to the independence, transparency and accountability of the new system. If done well, it could play a key role in reviewing complaints about members and in collecting and analysing data on the operation of the tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the abolition of the Immigration Assessment Authority and the fast-track process will see an end to a system that is cruel, inefficient and heavily politicised. Both were established to allow a review of the refugee status determination decisions made under legislation passed to deal with what is known as the legacy caseload of asylum seekers who arrived in Australia as unauthorised maritime arrivals between 2012 and 2013. But both failed in their duty to provide fair and effective review of asylum applications, with little done to expedite or resolve the legacy caseload. In February 2023 over 12,000 cases remained unresolved. In truth, many of the people refused under the fast-track process are indeed refugees with strong claims for protection, but they have not received a fair, thorough or robust assessment from the IAA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I echo calls, then, for this government to introduce a policy to ensure that those previously refused under the fast-track process receive a fresh review. I also reiterate my calls for a royal commission into our offshore processing of asylum seekers. At some point we must turn a light on this long-term government policy, to not just hold to account those who've been instrumental in the destruction of literally thousands of lives but also ensure past mistakes are not repeated. Ultimately, while these bills seek to strengthen integrity and improve accessibility to the ART, I hold serious concerns that they fall well short of that goal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The design of this legislation means that many of the benefits being introduced broadly will not apply to the Migrant and Refugee Division. Indeed, the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill maintains the carveout of a separate, more restrictive procedural code for the Migration and Refugee Division in the Migration Act 1958. The decision to retain this code undermines a lot of the good this legislation could do as it creates a disparity in the treatment of migrant and refugee applicants compared to applicants generally, preventing them from equality under the law. This just seems incomprehensible when viewed within the self-described ambition of this reform to establish a unified, cohesive tribunal with flexible powers and procedures that best meet the needs of applicants. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This tribunal is intended to play a vital role in protecting the rights and interests of members of our community. It will be required to pursue that objective by providing administrative review that is fair and just; resolves applications in a timely manner; is accessible and responsive to the diverse needs of people involved; improves the transparency and quality of government decision-making; and ultimately promotes public trust and confidence in the tribunal. Yet, the carveout of separate and more restrictive procedural codes for migrant applicants contradicts these very principles. The justification for such a carveout is on the grounds of efficiency, and it is true that the AAT has historically faced a major struggle in processing the backlogs of migration and refugee applications. But, rather than what is currently proposed, these applicants have incredibly high needs that require dedicated measures to improve accessibility not carve out and hinder them. This differing treatment of some is not reflective of meeting diverse needs; rather, it is discriminatory. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As evidenced in the Refugee Advice and Casework Service submission to the inquiry on this bill, migrant and refugee applicants typically experience barriers to accessing justice that others do not. In this context the distinction between citizen and noncitizen releases the ART from obligations to comply with procedural fairness for all. Ultimately, the shortcomings of this separate procedural code can be broken down into three core areas. The first of these is the inconsistency in the time limits for migrant applications. Where this legislation generally allows the ART to extend the period during which an applicant may apply to the tribunal for review of a decision, it provides that this time extension does not apply to reviewable migration or protection decisions. The only other options available to these applicants would be to apply for a judicial review in the Federal Court or to seek the exercise of the minister's non-reviewable, non-compellable discretion. Both channels are currently overwhelmed and come at a significant cost in terms of time and resources. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second shortcoming is the codification of the natural justice hearing rule for migrant and refugee matters, which when compared to the common law approach for others does not make sense. In fact, it significantly increases the resources required by the tribunal's members and staff, including additional training. Thirdly, it should be deeply concerning to all of us that this bill retains provisions that restrict the right of migration applicants to be represented. I cannot be clearer when I say that the exclusion of legal representation for migration and refugee cases in contrast to all other cases at the ART is wrong. People with migrant and refugee applications are often unaware of the legal requirements of their appeal and often need assistance to explain their case to a decision-maker. The lack of support for migrant and protection applicants in accessing legal assistance and representation is not only bound to hinder the success of the case; I believe it is morally corrupt. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unhindered access to legal assistance for migrant applicants needs to be brought into line with others generally in the ART. At the same time, there needs to be adequate funding so that applicants who cannot afford legal assistance and representation are able to do so. Ultimately, my community joins me in arguing that the substandard treatment of migrant and refugee applicants is neither fair nor just, and we must do better. For these reasons, I will be moving a second reading amendment to the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 1) Bill 2023 when it is brought forward at the end of this cognate debate. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  The cost of everyday essentials is through the roof. Last year, we saw the price of milk increase by 19.4 per cent. While a couple of cents on the household essentials may not seem so severe, how much more is a healthy lunch box for our kids costing, and what are Aussies having to sacrifice to fill up their cars? Labor's ute tax is costing families and tradies as much as an extra $25,000 on vehicles. We all watched them fork out $240 million on the Voice, only to be met with a resounding 'no' from everyday Australians. Disappointingly, those are the same taxpayers whose hip pockets are hurting. Aussies have been left high and dry by a disconnected government who cannot seem to devise a plan to tackle the rising cost of living.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite promising Aussies $275 off their electricity, we have sadly seen bills rise by 20 per cent. I've had far too many fearful and frustrated Bonner locals and small business owners reach out to my office about the rising costs of their electricity. They ask: 'What about the $275 savings we were promised at the last election?' One business owner in my electorate even said that they will have no choice but to close up shop if electricity goes up in the next quarter. I've been very, very sorry to see that the strong economy left by the coalition has all but evaporated completely. So, next time you're at the shops picking up some milk and sugar or paying for your electricity bill, I urge each of you to stop and ask: 'Why am I paying so much more?

Glenda is a highly experienced community leader who has an in-depth understanding of the not-for-profit sector. She has expertise in a range of social policy areas, including gender issues, health, education, children, housing and homelessness, and volunteering. A former Air Force air traffic controller and past chair of the ACT Council of Social Services, Glenda is involved in several community organisations that focus on empowering women and girls. Glenda is an active volunteer with Zonta International, a strong contributor to the social enterprise and small business taskforce with the Canberra Business Chamber, and the CEO of Fearless Women, a program that provides girls and young women in the ACT with a support service to help them find their voice. It offers short-term counselling, equips girls and women with the tools and resources they need and offers longer term mentoring support. The program caters to girls and young women who may need additional support due to internal or external factors. Thank you, Glenda, for your tireless and fearless effort in mentoring and empowering future generations of Canberra women.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  Last Friday, it was wonderful to welcome the shadow minister for small business, industry skills and training, Sussan Ley, to my electorate of Casey. We had a Politics in the Pub at the Chirnside Park Country Club—thank you very much for hosting. It was wonderful to talk to many tradies and small business owners about the challenges that they are facing. I am fortunate to represent the electorate of Casey, which has the highest number of tradies in any electorate across the country as a percentage of workforce. In talking to the plumbers, the sparkies, the bakers and some builders that were there as well about the challenges they are facing, one issue of great concern that came up is apprentices and being able to get access to apprentices. It's harder than ever, and under this government, in Labor's first year in office, Victoria lost one in 10 apprentices and trainees. It's a drop of 11,630 people. It's getting harder and harder for businesses to bring apprentices on. In many cases they're being required to pay and put up money that they don't have to support these apprentices. It was an issue that kept coming up, along with things like energy and the continued cost increases in raw materials. While our businesses are doing it tough, they still have a sense of optimism that they will be there, and they're going to keep providing the materials, the buildings and the work we need across this country. Thank you to the deputy leader, Sussan Ley, for coming out, and thank you to all those tradies for the work they do building our nation.</span>

For over 16 years, this organisation has been a steadfast ally in the fight against hunger, poverty and social isolation in our community. During my recent visit, I witnessed firsthand the dedication of BB and her team of volunteers and staff, who tirelessly provide essential services to those in need. Find a Penny serves over 6,000 individuals weekly, providing much-needed meals to those most in need. From street soup kitchens to home deliveries, they have catered to diverse groups such as the homeless, low-income families, refugees and seniors. Their commitment to creating inclusive spaces and providing nutritious food is truly commendable and serves as a beacon of hope for our community. I am proud to support the vital work of the Find a Penny Foundation. The support they provide to thousands of at-risk individuals is irreplaceable. I am proud to represent wonderful charities like the Find a Penny Foundation in the Parliament of Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  The national statistics are shocking: one woman is killed every week by a current or former partner, and one in four women experience sexual or intimate partner violence in their lifetimes. The local impact on every community is shocking. Domestic violence is not confined to just one part of the country, and, sadly, my community in Wentworth is not immune. In fact, police commanders tell me that domestic violence is responsible for around half of the police work in our local area, and I've heard countless heartbreaking stories of women subjected to this terrible abuse.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why having local support services is absolutely critical. We are lucky to have several such services in Wentworth, but they're under serious strain. The Lokahi Foundation, which supports survivors of domestic and family violence, is dealing with government funding not being renewed. Just last month, we thought it might be forced to close its doors, and it's only been able to stay open thanks to a generous private donor. Another organisation, JewishCare, has received so many requests for support, from people of all faiths and none, that it needs additional resources to keep up with the case load. It's turning away up to 10 people daily—people seeking refuge either from DV or from other issues. It is absolutely critical that the government continue to fund domestic violence services, particularly in my community but also around the country, and I call on them to do so.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Last week I wrote to the independent offshore gas regulator, NOPSEMA, to voice my concerns and the concerns of my community regarding a seismic exploration proposal by TGS-SLB in Victoria's Otway Basin. I requested that NOPSEMA halt the approval process in light of 'the deeply flawed and insufficient consultation process' conducted by the companies. Surfers, First Nations people, fishers and community groups have all come to me to express their frustration. I included their criticisms in my letter. These included poor advertising of public meetings, long and often confusing documents, a lack of transparency and clarity, avoidance of face-to-face meetings, and a failure to consult with culturally appropriate people. Overall, these groups stressed that consultation was neither sufficient, meaningful nor accessible and did not meet regulatory permit requirements. Seismic exploration is carried out using underwater air guns which generate sound waves to find gas reservoirs beneath the ocean. If consultation is not conducted properly, it can have adverse implications for our environment, our marine life, jobs and the economy. That's why it's important for the regulator to look more closely at this proposal. I will meet with NOPSEMA this week to discuss this significant issue for my community, who love our coastal environment. Like them, I know our oceans are such an important part of our way of life.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Men need to hear this. For way too long, women have shouldered the load of driving the conversation about violence prevention, basic decency and respect. Violence against women is a men's problem. Men, today I ask you to be the ones to step in and to know the steps you can take to move from being a bystander to being part of the solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in the supposed lucky country, yet we count dead women. In the first 10 weeks of this year, 19 women have been killed in Australia. In 2023, 75 Australian women and 11 children lost their lives, mostly at the hands of men they knew. Experts know what's needed: crisis housing, legal services, frontline services, prevention, better data and sustained funding. But they, and we, need men to show leadership to bring the change. I say to the Prime Minister: you have to lead this, to be that man. Use your authority from the most powerful office in this land and please speak as a man to men. It's a national emergency. Enough is enough.</span>

I want to take a moment to celebrate and congratulate some Fisher businesses for achieving incredible things. Mooloolaba Fisheries were named finalists in the Queensland Seafood Industry Awards, featuring in the top three in the Best Large Seafood Company and Best Fish and Chip Shop in Queensland categories. Who doesn't love fish and chips? Who doesn't love fish and chips in Mooloolaba? Moffat Beach Brewing had a stellar show at the Royal Queensland Beer Awards, taking out the Grand Champion title for the third time in four years. I have to disclose that I am a teetotaller, so I'm going to have to take the judges' word on that, but Moffat Beach Brewing are a great local business and everybody speaks about how good their beers are. Sow 'n Sow in Maleny is a great local business run by Michelle Brady. She stocks sustainable Australian native giftware at our very own Parliament House gift shop. I was there just a couple of days ago and they're doing a great job.</span>

Well, not for much longer. You see, the poor old NAB must be doing it tough at the moment. The $7 billion profit they made last year apparently isn't enough to keep the Cessnock branch open. Without any consultation with the community of Cessnock, its customers or its representatives, last week the NAB announced it would close the Cessnock branch in June. This will mean that the NAB doesn't have a single branch or ATM in the Cessnock local government area—an area of more than 65,000 people.</span>

Regional people have traditionally been loyal in how they shop and how they bank, but loyalty is a two-way street. These NAB fraudsters haven't shown much loyalty to their customers in the Hunter. I believe we no longer owe any loyalty to them. The NAB has turned its back on the motto: 'More than money'. I encourage them to reconsider their decision, do the right thing and choose people over profits. What an absolute disgrace, NAB.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  Last Saturday I attended the 70th anniversary of the Loftus Volunteer Bushfire Brigade, a steadfast pillar of support for our local community. Down in my part of the world we live in the best part of the best country in the world, but the land of droughts and flooding rains takes its toll. That's why the Loftus Volunteer Bushfire Brigade is such an important part of our local community. Its support extends not only to the residents of Loftus and the Sutherland shire but throughout the whole of New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly locally, the brigade has responded to incidents at the Caltex oil refinery as well as many motor vehicle accidents and also provides crews for hazard reduction. This is a vital activity for our community, as we adjoin the Royal and Heathcote national parks. The brigade also plays a vital role in education, with bushfire preparedness, and year after year the brigade receives tremendous support from its local Santa runs. The strength of the Loftus brigade also lies in its diversity, with operational members ranging from the ages of 19 through to 92. Volunteer members of the brigade come from a wide range of vocational and professional backgrounds as well as defence and emergency services. It currently has 14 new probationary members, which sets it up for a very fine future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, on behalf of my electorate I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Loftus Volunteer Bushfire Brigade. To all of you who have been or are part of the brigade: thank you for your service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  I'm proud to stand here as a member of the governing party that is doing the right thing again, in this case bringing forward the modern emission standards for vehicles. The government's proposals bring us in line with the rest of the world bar Russia and North Korea. The US have had these standards for 50 years. They've had them because they're better for the environment, better for health and better for the hip pocket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to make this change a positive for all, so we've been engaging with manufacturers, peak bodies and dealers to ensure this happens. In Hasluck, I've met with a number of dealerships from the Midland car area to better feed their valuable insights into this process. I've also met with people across the community like Dr Colin Hughes, who knows that this plan is good for the health of every one of us and the health of our children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Better emissions standards will save lives and improve outcomes for people who suffer from respiratory illnesses. And these new standards will make it cheaper for Australians at the bowser. Now everyone who buys a new car, not just people buying electric vehicles, will save money at the pump. People buying petrol or diesel vehicles will now save, too, because they're buying a more efficient vehicle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fuel emissions standards are another example of how this government is finding innovative ways to address cost-of-living challenges. The opposition could have done this years ago, but they squibbed it. They have cost Australians over $4 billion because they squibbed and delayed introducing what this government, as a responsible government, is doing today.</span>

The Prime Minister claims coal is no longer viable, but if you're the barman and tell someone, 'No more drinks for you, mate,' unsurprisingly, he won't stick around. Meanwhile, it's drinks on the house for wind turbine and solar farm proponents, while the bouncer is telling the nuclear energy businessman he can't come in—all while the Allan Labor government keeps locking gas out, despite gas keeping the lights on.</span>

Disgracefully, Premier Allan has doubled down, fast-tracking the planning process to give more freebies to wind turbines while she rides roughshod over legitimate community concern. Even after the Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner, Andrew Dyer, called them out, TCV keep spurring on Labor's out-of-control, reckless renewables railroad. I spent considerable time organising meetings at Tragowel and St Arnaud between TCV and Mallee residents, but TCV pulled out at literally the eleventh hour, to the outrage of local people. I went ahead with the meetings, filming testimonies and forwarding them to TCV, through the commissioner, so that Mallee people would be heard.</span>

It's a constant in the lives of millions of Australians with chronic conditions and all too familiar for millions more Australians who suffer from acute illnesses at any time. It's also a constant expense. Unfortunately, many Australians who have been feeling the effects of the cost-of-living pressures have had to ration their medications or even go without. No Australian should ever have to choose between paying their bills, feeding their family or filling a script.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the 2022 election, the Albanese government promised to make medicines cheaper, and our policy is helping now more than ever. On 1 January 2023, the Albanese government slashed the PBS co-payment to $12.50, the largest reduction in the 75-year history of the PBS. Since then, Australians have saved $280 million. My community has saved $1.5 million since the co-payment was reduced and is set to save more during 2024. Australians can now fill their scripts for cheaper at a growing list of pharmacies across the country, and Australians are set to save more with the recent expansion of the medicines eligible for 60-day dispensing. The Albanese medicines policy is providing ongoing cost-of-living relief and ensuring Australians can keep more of what they earn.</span>

We lost a stalwart of public service and a true son of Mareeba, Mr Tom Gilmore OAM. His passing not only leaves a void in the hearts of those who knew him but also marks the end of an era of dedicated community service that is rare to behold. Tom was more than a political figure; he was an icon and a true leader. Born and raised in Mareeba, Tom's journey from local council through to the Queensland parliament and back into the mayor's office is a testament to his unwavering dedication to our region.</span>

He was a man who valued family, community and service above all else. I extend my deepest condolences to his wife, Sally, his daughters, Elisa and Catherine, and the broader Gilmore family and their friends. Tom will be remembered not just as a fine public servant but as a true friend, a mentor, a dedicated visionary and a proud Far North Queenslander. Vale, Tom Gilmore. Thank you for your service and your friendship. You will be sorely missed.</span>

Of course, the latest form of denialism is not to outright deny but to put up smokescreens for denial, specifically to suggest that nuclear energy is the right path for Australia's transition to energy. The shadow minister, the member for Fairfax, really gave the game away on that form of denial in his recent <span style="font-style:italic;">7</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span style="font-style:italic;">30</span> interview, when he said words to the effect of, 'Well, yes, we do want coal to last for as long as possible.' It is astonishing that a party that likes to present itself in this place as a sound economic manager would endorse, in this country, such an unviable, ruinously expensive and hazardous venture as nuclear energy—an industry that currently doesn't exist here, that essentially hasn't been developed in the form being proposed by those opposite anywhere in the world, that all the experts tell us would be the most expensive, most uncertain way for Australia to meet our future power needs and that Australian power companies have said they want nothing to do with. This is just the climate denial wolf dressed up in nuclear sheep's clothing. Australians deserve a government that secures their nation's energy future and that is on their side, working to drive costs down—not on a horrifically expensive, ideologically driven nuclear frolic.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  Many people join our Defence Force by calling a number—it's 131901—but, for most, that seed and that desire are planted earlier. We heard that, for Jack Fitzgibbon, it was decided next to his dad when he saw an Army truck go from Singleton through the electorate. On those very same streets that he would have seen an Army truck, his family, his friends and those who served with him gathered to say goodbye. I want to say to his dad, Joel, his mum, Di, and his sisters, Caitlin and Grace: you all spoke beautifully about your son and your brother.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the members of the Defence Force Special Operations Command—2nd Commando Regiment, in particular— his platoon, the Corps of Signals—he was a signaller—and the Commando Welfare Trust: thank you so much for gathering on that most solemn of occasions to say farewell. His dad, Joel, said that when Jack's name came up on his phone he would call him by his full name, Jack Fitzgibbon, like we would to a naughty child but one that we loved dearly. In the pamphlet for him, it says: 'Whatever we were to each other, that we are still. Call me by my old, familiar name.' Rest in peace, Jack Fitzgibbon.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Today the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> reports that Australians' power bills are set to fall. There's much more work to do, but, gee, this was nice news to wake up to! The article reads:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Homes and businesses will start to feel some relief from soaring electricity bills within months, as authorities move to cut prices for hundreds of thousands of customers on the eastern seaboard by as much as 10 per cent …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not surprisingly, the article goes on to point out that 'the continuing influx of cheaper renewable energy' has contributed to this draft default market offer. Newsflash to the Liberals: actually having an energy policy works! Our coal and gas price caps, opposed by the Liberals, have helped, and our investments in renewables and batteries have helped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People know that solar panels and batteries on their homes help with power prices. Experts know that large-scale renewables lead to cheaper wholesale power prices. But, inexplicably, the Liberals and Nationals continue their ideological opposition to our national energy transition. Instead of the cheapest form of new energy, they want to invest in the most expensive form of new energy: nuclear. Australians elected us to take action on the cost of living, and we are—by giving every Australian tax cut. And by having an energy policy anchored in renewable energy, we want Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  I rise today to commend the Prime Minister and Minister Watt for achieving in WA agriculture what no-one else has managed to do—that is, to unite the Western Australian Farmers Federation and the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia to form a formidable front to fight this government's war on farmers. Precipitated by Labor's politically motivated decision to ban the live export of sheep by sea, this fight has also been fuelled by a plethora of assaults on agriculture, such as Labor's ute tax, the new biosecurity levy, agriculture visa changes and farm labour shortages.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">WAFF president, John Hassell, and PGA president, Tony Seabrook, say they have no choice but to get political, and they're raising a $6 million war chest to challenge Labor in marginal Perth seats at the next federal election. PGA president, Tony Seabrook, named the Labor seats of Tangney, Hasluck, Swan, Pearce and Cowan—and I'm betting that we'll have plenty of retired cockies backing them to win back Curtin as well. The PM needs to understand that there will be a political price to pay for persecuting WA farmers, whose only crime is to feed and clothe our great nation, and export specialist product, like live sheep, to nations that cannot produce their own.</span>

Unlike those opposite, we want to make sure—and we'll act in this place to ensure—that there is real cost-of-living relief for Australian businesses and Australian households, and to make cheaper energy.</span>

They all voted against capping coal and gas prices. We also want to invest in renewable energy—the cheapest form of energy, and something that those opposite have fought each and every day in this place. The other thing we've done is give $3 billion of investment in electricity price rebates to households and small businesses, something that those opposite voted against. That was because we know that the cheapest form of energy is renewable energy.</span>

He wants to make Australian consumers, Australian households and Australian businesses pay through the roof for their energy bills. Well, we're going to keep investing in the cheapest form of energy. We know that solar and wind are part of their ideological war against lower power prices, but we know those things are good for the environment and good for Australian households.

In January of this year, a record 125,410 visa holders arrived in Australia, far outstripping the housing stock available here in our country. Given permanent and long-term overseas arrivals are outpacing the construction of new homes at a rate of almost four to one, can the Prime Minister tell the House how many new homes or units were built in January?</span>

Indeed, just last week the Centre for Population put out a population forecast which showed that the Australian population is now expected to be smaller in 2030-31 than the pre-pandemic forecast published by the former government, when this bloke here was the cabinet minister responsible for migration. Here's what the population statement said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">For 2030-31, the expected population is … 0.6 million people (2.1 per cent) below what was projected prior to the onset of the pandemic in the 2019-20 MYEFO.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just when he was the minister, because this is what the Leader of the Opposition has said with his current title, of Leader of the Opposition. He said this on 2 September 2022: 'We do need an increase in the migration numbers.' </span>

                  </a>  Speaker, it's become a practice now from those opposite standing up to take a point of order to not nominate any standing order at all that they think is being breached. In previous parliaments, when it has got to this point, there have been times when the Speaker has simply insisted that, at the start, someone has to nominate what standing order they're raising, because otherwise it's just being used as extra speeches.</span>

                  </a>  I think we'll sort this out one way or the other. Moving forward, if you get up and don't say what the standing order is, you'll leave the chamber immediately. Just so that everyone is crystal clear: there will be no more coming to the dispatch box, giving a speech or asking a question. Under the standing orders, there is one time to take a point of order on relevance. It's pretty easy to do. You simply get up and say, 'I'm taking my point of order on relevance.' This is the warning shot. It is happening more and more. Question time is not going to operate like that. If you do that, you won't stay. The Prime Minister in continuation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:06</span>):  I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. Like everyone on this side of the House, she has no higher priority than helping her community on the South Coast with the cost of living, helping her community earn more through strong wages growth and helping them keep more of what they earn through tax cuts that this government will deliver to every taxpayer on 1 July. She also promised her community cheaper medicines. We've delivered on that promise as well. We've cut the maximum yearly medicines bills for pensioners and concession card holders, meaning that around two million Australians right now are paying up to 25 per cent less for their medicines every year. Last year we delivered the biggest cut in the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the PBS, meaning that general patients are paying around $20 million less for their medicines every month, and around 200 common medicines are now available for a 60-day supply at the cost of a single script, saving patients time and saving them even more money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the opposition voted against those cheaper medicines, and they said the sky would fall if we proceeded with them. Instead, I'm happy to report that the number of applications to open a new pharmacy has been 50 per cent higher since we announced that measure than in the same period before the announcement, and I am delighted about that, because our government wants cheaper medicines and a strong community pharmacy sector—a pharmacy sector in strong financial health delivering even more services to Australian patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm also delighted that 3,000 pharmacies so far have signed up to become providers under the National Immunisation Program since we allowed them to do that, since 1 January. And it's why I'm also delighted that we signed a heads of agreement with the Pharmacy Guild last week for a new community pharmacy agreement to start in July, delivering cheaper medicine, better patient outcomes and a strong community pharmacy sector underpinned by an investment from this government of up to an additional $3 billion, which we were able to do because of the strong budget management of this government and this Treasurer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a robust negotiation; there is no doubt about that. And there's nothing wrong with that. We know that those opposite would have given in at the first hint of pressure. They would have wilted like a daffodil in a stiff summer breeze and left patients high and dry, paying more for their medicines, just as they did over that long decade. Well, that's not our approach. We were determined to get an outcome that is good for community pharmacy and also good for patients, and that is what we did last week. </span>

This government promised Australians a $275 cut to their electricity bill by 2025, but households in my electorate of Lindsay are owed a $1,027 cut to deliver on this promise. Today's release of draft regulator prices for electricity confirm this government's failure to deliver, with annual bills in Western Sydney up 37 per cent on early 2022. Will the minister admit this promise will never be delivered?</span>

What the announcement by the Australian Energy Regulator today shows is that energy prices are stabilising and falling after the highest energy prices the world has seen in 50 years. I would have thought that would be welcome news to the House. Nobody should underestimate the cost-of-living pressures that the Australian people are under and the need to be constantly vigilant to do more to help Australians with those cost-of-living pressures, including when it comes to energy prices.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These announcements by the Australian Energy Regulator today are the result of several events. They are the result of the coal and gas caps that have been put in place by this government, which those opposite voted against. They are the result of reducing international pressure. We pointed to the international pressure when prices went up; we point to the international changes when prices go down. They are the result of getting more renewables into the grid because renewables are the cheapest form of energy—</span>

                  </a>  That always sets them off, but it's true. These announcements are also the result of a request by me as the federal minister, supported by state ministers, to the Energy Regulator to prioritise the needs of consumers—which overturned a previous request from the former minister for energy, the former member for Kooyong, changing that direction to the Australian Energy Regulator—and that has been reflected in the results today. These are all positive developments. They're a welcome development in the face of ongoing pressures.</span>

                  </a>  I do appreciate the sensitivities of those opposite, who voted against the coal and gas caps and voted against the energy rebates that were in the budget, which provided support to millions of households. I also understand the sensitivity of those opposite because the draft that was released today is the default market offer. That was released in accordance with the law; released openly and transparently. I did not sign a regulation to hide it. I did not instruct the Australian regulator today not to release it. It is possible to do such a thing. It has been done in the past. The former minister for energy signed such a regulation on 31 March 2022—which I table, signed by the member for Hume—instructing the Australian Energy Regulator not to release a 20 per cent increase in power prices just days before the last federal election, which was a very dishonourable thing for the honourable member to do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:14</span>):  I thank the member for Swan for her question and for hosting me regularly in her wonderful seat in Perth. She knows that making health care more affordable is one of the key elements of this government's plan. Making it more accessible is part of our plan for a better future. That's why we've rolled out 58 urgent care clinics right around the country. That's why there'll be more included in our budget coming up in May. That's why the centrepiece of our last budget was tripling our investment in bulk-billing—the largest-ever increase in support for the Medicare system since Medicare was introduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other element, of course, which the health minister has presided over, is the important reform of making medicines cheaper. First, we had a policy that we announced during the election campaign of a reduction from $42.50 down to $30 that came in on 1 January. Since then, that has resulted in savings of around $300 million. But there's more, because our historic 60-day prescription policy has already saved Australians $12 million between September and January alone. Most importantly, it means fewer trips to the doc. It means fewer trips to the pharmacy. It means people can get the care they need with the regular prescriptions they need, be it for diabetes or heart conditions, so they can have that certainty of the availability of 60-day prescriptions. And, importantly, there is now broad support for 60-day prescriptions, including from community pharmacies. The only people who are still opposing 60-day prescriptions are those opposite, who say, 'We want people to go to the doctor twice as often, we want them to pay twice as much, and we want them to be so inconvenienced.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're supporting pharmacists as well to deliver more primary care services, which is something spoken about by those opposite but never delivered. What this is about is making sure that it's easier for Australians to get the care they need when they need it, taking action on cost of living on health care together with our tax cuts that come in on 1 July for every taxpayer, together with cheaper child care, together with the 300,000 fee-free TAFE places that commenced last year, together with our energy price relief plan that has had a positive impact—all of them opposed by those opposite, an opposition bereft of any ideas or any—</span>

You've said you will make political donations transparent, ban lies in political ads and reduce financial influence in elections. The next election is looming. Given the high public interest in this issue, will the parliament and the public have an opportunity to comment on an exposure draft, or will we be presented with a bill by the major parties that's designed to lock out political competition?</span>

And if the member for Curtin wants me to talk about some of the lobbying that's going on, including from crossbenchers, I'm happy to do so, because one of the issues that does need transparency is the issue of political donations. We have had a long position in the Labor Party—something that was overturned by the former government; something that goes back to the period of the Hawke and Keating governments—that was then overturned by the Howard government, and then there were reforms under the Labor government and then those were overturned further on.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are consulting very broadly including with members and representatives of the crossbench and the minor parties as well as across the major parties to see if reform, as proposed by Minister Farrell, can receive very broad support. One of the objectives that we have here is to land reform that stays, not reform that comes and goes with changes of government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My view has been very clear: there needs to be transparency when it comes to political donations, and there needs to be a stopping—to give just one example—of the sort of largess that we saw from Clive Palmer during the last two election campaigns. I don't think it is tenable at all to have the sorts of dollars washing around the system such as occurs in the United States. I think that is unhealthy and I think it undermines our democracy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make no apologies for the fact that we will engage, as I have engaged with the member for Curtin and other crossbenchers at meetings that have been held about these issues. I will continue to do so. Senator Farrell, as the minister, will continue to make himself available to see if we can, indeed, entrench greater support for our democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I realise that in a whole range of ways there are a range of changes in technology and changes in practice that are undermining faith in our democracy. That is something we've been determined to do. We promised to have a national anticorruption commission up and running. We did that. We did that in record time. It was promised previously by former governments and was delivered by this government, consistent with our approach to cleaning up politics.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:22</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Boothby for the question. From day one, this government has been working hard to improve paid parental leave for working families. First, we made the changes from 1 July 2023 to give more families access to the payment, made it more flexible to support parents and the transition back to work and made it much easier for parents to share care by creating a single payment that both parents can access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we took another significant step forward. With the successful passage of our legislation in the parliament, we are delivering the largest expansion of paid parental leave since Labor established this back in 2011. By expanding the scheme to a full six months by 2026, families will receive an extra six weeks of paid leave following the birth or adoption of their child when fully rolled out. That is over $5,000 more to help with the family budget, but we're not stopping there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has recently announced that we will pay superannuation on the government paid parental leave scheme. Paying super on the government paid parental leave scheme will help normalise paid parental leave as a workplace entitlement just like annual leave and sick leave and will reduce the impact of taking parental leave on retirement incomes. Many, many people have called for this and have welcomed this announcement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Women's Economic Equality Taskforce have provided their report to the government, and they made this a key recommendation. Chief Executive Women said, 'Paying super on paid parental leave is a huge milestone for women.' The Business Council of Australia called it the 'right thing to do for both women and the economy'. The Parenthood said, 'This is a game changer for families across Australia.' The Financial Services Council said it would increase the financial and wellbeing of Australian women. CPA Australia said, 'Paying super on paid parental leave is well worth it.' And the ACTU, of course, called it a 'historical step'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amongst all this positivity about our super announcement, it was disappointing that the first instinct from those opposite was to express negativity and reservation about our positive plan. Now, this is not a surprise, considering that those opposite called women of Australia, the mums of Australia, double dippers when they dared to take their leave provided by their workplace and the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme. Well, this government is standing up for working women, and we hope those opposite will too. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The latest national accounts confirm that Australia is in an entrenched per capita recession or a family recession. At the same time disposable income per person—living standards—has collapsed by 7½ per cent under Labor. Right now, population growth is the only thing left driving the economy. Treasurer, why are hardworking families paying the price for this government's failed economic management?</span>

There was debt and deficit as far as the eye can see. We were paying far too much to service the debt that they left behind—the trillion dollars of Liberal debt. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr CLARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:29</span>):  I thank my good friend the sensational member for Solomon for his question. The Northern Territory has some of the most disadvantaged communities in the country. At the moment it also has the most underfunded schools in the country. At the moment they're funded at less than 80 per cent of what David Gonski said they should be. In other words, one in five kids in class in the Northern Territory today aren't being funded at all. In other words, they're not getting the support they need and that other children take for granted to learn to read, write and finish school. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Until last week, that wasn't supposed to be fixed until 2050. That's the date when they were expected to hit 100 per cent of what David Gonski said they needed. We announced last week that we are bringing this forward by more than 20 years. To do that, we are going to double Commonwealth government funding to public schools in the Northern Territory. This is the biggest new investment in schools in the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth government ever. It is not a blank cheque. As I've said here and elsewhere, we're going to tie this funding to the sorts of things that help children who fall behind to catch up, keep up, finish school and then hopefully go on to TAFE or to university. It's also part of a bigger plan with every state and every territory to fund all public schools properly, where the Australian government chips in and where the states chip in, just as the Northern Territory government has chipped in, and where we tie this funding to real reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Northern Territory is different. The disadvantage there is bigger, and the challenge is bigger. Today, right around the country, children are doing NAPLAN tests, and if the last few years are a guide then one in 10 of the children sitting those tests won't meet the minimum standards we set for them. In the Northern Territory, one in three children won't meet those standards. The challenge is huge. That's why what we announced last week is so important, because if we are serious about helping those children who are falling behind and who are behind then this is what we've got to do: properly fund the schools that they go to and tie that funding to the sorts of things that help those children who fall behind to catch up, keep up and finish school. That includes things like catch-up tutoring. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to build a country where no-one is held back and no-one is left behind. These are not just words; this is backed by action, and that's what this billion-dollar investment in Northern Territory schools is all about. This will be a game changer for the Northern Territory and a life changer for the children who live there. </span>

Some of that waste is being stored onsite while we wait to find a location to store it long term. You heralded in the last parliament a proposed solution about how this would all work out, and then the courts found that that was all unworkable and all stuffed up—all as a result of those opposite. ANSTO has informed me that they are quite able to store those low levels of radioactive waste in the short term while a longer term answer is found. We would certainly welcome—but we're not holding our breath—a bipartisan response or approach to that. But, in the absence of that, we will get the job done. </span>

It gives us confidence that inflation is moderating in welcome and encouraging ways. Inflation has come off very substantially since its peak in 2022. And as I said a moment ago, in quarterly terms, inflation is now around a third of what we inherited from those opposite, and we know from the Australian Bureau of Statistics that our policies are contributing to the moderation and inflation. The budget restraint has given us the first surplus in 15 years, but we also know that the combination of our policies on electricity bill relief, early childhood education and rent assistance—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that it's not anything like 'mission accomplished', because people are still under considerable cost-of-living pressure. This is why our cost-of-living relief—including our tax cuts—is so important and it's why it has been designed to take the pressure off inflation rather than add to these inflationary pressures. It's also why we've ensured that we can fund tens of billions of dollars in cost-of-living help at the same time as we clean up the mess that those opposite left behind in the budget. People are under pressure—we acknowledge that—but because of our efforts people are earning more and they are keeping more of what they earn, inflation is moderating, the budget is in better nick, and the default market offer, as the energy minister said a moment ago, shows price reductions in the electricity market.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank governor has said before that our efforts in the budget have been very positive and very helpful in this fight against inflation. The governor will have an opportunity to expand on and explain the decision that they have taken today at the press conferences that the Governor Bullock has undertaken to do after each decision. I think this is a really good change; it has been well supported and it has been well received. It's one of a number of really important initiatives that came out of the Reserve Bank review undertaken by this government, and I encourage the parliament to support the other review recommendations as well.</span>

The answer to the second part of the question is that we won't rule out any state or territory. In answer to the first part of the question, the first nuclear reactor that we will need to be dealing with comes into play in about the 2050s, so we do have time in which to go through a process by which we determine where that nuclear waste will be stored. Part of being a responsible nuclear steward in the context of AUKUS is that we take responsibility for the full nuclear cycle, which includes the disposal of the reactors. We take that very seriously. We have indicated that we will go through an exhaustive process to assess where that will occur. The one statement that we've made up to this point in time about where is that it will happen on the current or future Defence estate.</span>

The Albanese Labor government is taking significant action in support of the critical minerals and rare earths industry of Australia. In Darwin last week, with many of my colleagues, I announced over $800 million of support from the Albanese government to Arafura Rare Earths to help deliver Australia's first combined integrated rare earths mine and refinery. The importance of this rare earths projects cannot be overestimated. It will sit 125 kilometres north of Alice Springs. It will bring 300 new jobs and deliver $1.4 billion of benefits right across the great Northern Territory. This is a job-creating economic boost for Alice Springs. Importantly for the communities of Alice Springs and right across the Top End, Arafura have set and are determined to meet their 20 per cent Indigenous employment target. The project is an ambitious step forward for our rare earths and critical minerals industry. It will open up new, secure supply chains and ultimately supply five per cent of global rare earth oxides. People may well ask: what do you use rare earth oxides for? They're very important to power the green energy revolution. They are integral ingredients in superstrong magnets that go into all sorts of green technologies, including electric vehicles. They are important for everyday mobile devices and laptops. They go into defence applications. So these rare earth oxides that will be produced north of Alice Springs will be vitally important.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, as you know, traditional resources exports of iron ore, coal and LNG are the bedrock of our national prosperity. The new resources industry of rare earths and critical minerals builds upon this exceptional tradition and will create more opportunities right across the country. The Nolans rare earth financing package includes $500 million under the Critical Minerals Facility, up to $115 million on Export Finance Australia's commercial account and $200 million from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. This financing will draw in another $840 million of finance from international equivalents of our Export Finance Australia, as well as commercial banks from Germany, France, Canada and the Republic of Korea, demonstrating how important international cooperation and collaboration are to develop the rare earths industry in this country.</span>

The program, as you know, will provide funding for planning capability, to get more housing approvals through the system more quickly, and for getting strategic plans in place to unlock new sites for housing investment, whether they be in Wodonga, in Benalla, in Beechworth or in Bright, or anywhere else across Australia. The funding will work alongside the planning reform blueprint, through which first ministers agreed to a range of planning reforms to accelerate housing supply in well-located areas. The Housing Support Program will also fund connections to essential services so that new housing isn't held up by delays to sewerage, to local roads and to connection to utilities. State, territory and local government have been calling for this funding, including in regional communities like the ones that the member for Indi and I represent. I'm pleased that this is a program that the Australian government is delivering, and I will welcome the applications from local government and state governments following the announcement next week.</span>

Members may be aware that Australian 3G networks are being switched over this year, and this impacts different devices in different ways. There are devices that rely solely on 3G, including 3G-only handsets, some EFTPOS machines and medical alarms. 3G-only handsets won't be able to make any calls after the switchover, and that will be apparent to users. The industry has been identifying and contacting customers with these devices.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there's also a subset of 4G handsets that use 4G for voice and data but are configured by the manufacturer to use 3G for triple 0 calls. Now, this category of handset is of more concern because it won't be apparent to users that their handset can't call triple 0 after the switchover; they'd only discover this during an emergency. My department has been seeking information on this issue to determine the scale, the scope and the actions being taken by industry. I was recently briefed and learnt that up to 740,000 devices may be impacted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Based on this advice, and particularly the scale, I am not satisfied that adequate efforts have been made by industry to identify and inform their impacted customers. Immediate action is needed, and that's why I've tasked mobile operators with establishing a new working group so industry collectively acts to improve their customer and handset identification and public information on this matter. I've asked Telstra, Optus and TPG to give me their action plans by 25 March, and fortnightly updates, and I've told CEOs directly that consumers must have easier ways to check if their handset is affected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government takes this issue extremely seriously. We'll continue to monitor the switchovers. I note that options exist in law—including potential proposals to delay 3G switchovers, if that is in the public interest and subject to consultation processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians rightly expect the triple 0 service can be relied on when they need it. It's one of the most critical public interest requirements for mobile carriers. The industry is now on notice to resolve this as an absolute priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Telecommunications should enrich people's lives and support public safety. That's why we're investing over $2.2 billion to strengthen our networks, including mobile network resilience and much-needed technology upgrades to the NBN, enabling speed boosts and helping Australians to get more for what they pay on their telco bills. The government understands that telecommunication services are vital, and we're making it a priority to keep Australians safe, connected and informed.</span>

Compulsory super is a really proud creation of the Labor government and the labour movement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our retirement income system is the envy of the world, but that doesn't mean it's perfect. It has its imperfections, and one of its imperfections is the gender gap when it comes to superannuation. To put it bluntly, parents—and especially mums—take much too big a hit when they take time off to have kids. The combination of the gender pay gap and the super gap means that women retire with about 25 per cent less super than men. Of course, we can't fix it overnight, but we are working hard to address the gender pay gap and the super gap at the same time. That's why we are really proud to have announced that we will now be paying the super guarantee on the government Paid Parental Leave scheme. We have said for some time that this is a priority for this Albanese Labor government, and now we will make it a reality for the mums and dads of Middle Australia. This will benefit about 180,000 families a year. It will boost retirement incomes for women. It will reduce some of the impact of interrupted work patterns. It will help make superannuation fairer. And, for all of these reasons, this is not just good social policy; this is good economic policy as well. We are paying super on paid parental leave and we are expanding and extending parental leave itself as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here I pay tribute to the social services minister for getting the paid parental leave extension through the parliament this week. What a really proud achievement of this minister and this government. I pay tribute to her and I pay tribute to the Assistant Treasurer. I pay tribute to Minister Gallagher and, before her, the environment minister. I pay tribute to the member for Newcastle and others who have campaigned for so long for this really important change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is all about ensuring that Australian women can earn more and keep more of what they earn and retire with more as well. Our tax cuts are better for women. Our wages policy is better for women. Our retirement incomes policy is better for women as well, and all three of these important policy areas are working together to close the pay gap and to close the superannuation gap as well. This is how we build on proud Labor legacies like paid parental leave and compulsory superannuation, to deliver for mums, dads and families; for local communities; and for the national economy as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:56</span>):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Tomorrow the Greens will introduce a bill to create divestiture powers so we can finally break up the Coles and Woolworths duopoly and end the price gouging—powers that already exist in Europe and the United States. Will your government stand on the side of Australians and take on the big supermarket corporations, or will you just trot out your weak excuses about the Soviet Union and let the giant supermarkets continue to ride roughshod over Australians?</span>

I could barely hear that question because of the noise, so can we just make sure that questions are heard in silence, and hopefully answers will be heard in silence as well.</span>

Who would've had that on their bingo card? When it comes to supermarkets what we have done is intervene in a range of ways. Firstly, we have directed the ACCC to conduct an inquiry into supermarket prices and we have made it very clear that, if the ACCC recommend to us further mandating of the current voluntary code of conduct, then we are completely up for that. We've appointed Dr Emerson to lead a review of the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct. We're partnered with CHOICE to provide Australian households with better information on the comparative cost of goods. We've increased penalties for anti-competitive conduct. We've banned unfair contract terms. We've introduced legislation in this House to allow designated small advocates to fast-track complaints through the ACCC, and we look forward to it being supported.</span>

He has said that the coalition were too slow, and on that we agree with the Leader of the Nationals. He has said that the Nationals wanted to move a lot quicker in terms of a compulsory grocery code, and I say to the Leader of the Nationals: break away! There are opportunities to break away from the shackles of the Liberal Party that have been holding you back for all of this time. I encourage you to break away.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm surprised that the Nats, in breaking away, have indicated their support for the Greens political party. I didn't see that coming, in spite of the colours on their how-to-vote cards. The Leader of the National Party is now saying that the tail, instead of being at the back of the Liberal Party dog, will be wagging away in conjunction with the Greens.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:01</span>):  I thank the wonderful member for Moreton for his question. Eighty-one thousand taxpayers in Moreton are getting an average tax cut of $1,554 right back into their pockets. This government, the Albanese government, is laser-focused on delivering cost-of-living relief for families. That's why we took action to deliver cheaper child care last year—reforms that increase the childcare subsidy for one million families right across Australia. Those reforms, according to the ACCC, reduced out-of-pocket expenses for centre based care by an average of 11 per cent. More affordable early learning means that more children can access the transformational benefits of early learning in those key first five years, which we know are so important to child development. But it also means that the primary caregiver, who is often the woman, can go back to work if she so chooses, can take on extra work if she so chooses and can contribute to the family budget and also add to that cost-of-living relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government, not only will families earn more; they'll keep more of what they earn, because from 1 July our tax cuts mean that every single taxpayer—that's 13.6 million Australians—will get a tax cut. Thirteen point six million Australians are getting a tax cut. For example, a family with a household income of $120,000 a year will get a tax cut of $2,676. Thanks to our cheaper child care reforms, which lifted the childcare subsidy for them, if that family has a child in early childhood education and care, they'll get a further $1,700 back into their pockets through our cheaper child care reforms. That's real money, real cost-of-living relief right back into the pockets of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can compare that to those opposite, who, when in office, had keeping wages low as a centrepiece of their economic reform. That was their centrepiece. That was their policy. They were very clearly proud of that being their policy. Well, we on this side want to see wages moving again. Those opposite want people to work longer for less, but we want people to earn more and to keep more of what they earn.</span>

This is a continuation of the misinformation that those opposite like to peddle, and we will continue to point out the facts, with some support from those honourable members opposite who know the facts, like the member for Bradfield, who pointed out that the evidence from overseas was that there would be no material change in the price of any vehicle and that they would not expect any material change in the price here. That was the member for Bradfield when he actually stood for something and actually argued for reforms that he believed in, which is a change in events.</span>

I also point out in relation to price impacts, which I was asked about by the honourable member, that the FCAI, the peak group which has made claims, in this case, in terms of price impacts, clarified their position on the weekend and said, 'This is not a forecast on price impacts,' which is a considerable change.</span>

We run a consultative government which listens to people, works with people and takes on board sensible suggestions as to how we can best implement our policies.

Indeed, the government is very focused on the fact that renewables are the cheapest form of new energy and that firming capacity through gas or the use of batteries will be important in driving that home. But we have had some alternatives floated, and the Leader of the Opposition's media team were around the gallery yesterday saying they were going to make a decision last night and were going to announce their nuclear policy. Today he went to the party room and said, 'Well, there were a few details that were outstanding—just four: safety, disposal, cost and location.' So, apart from safety, apart from the disposal, apart from the cost and apart from where they're going to go, it's all sorted out for those opposite. Good news, team! Other than that, everything is ready to go. It's ready to rip. We just need to buy the land, pour the slab, build the walls and put the roof on. Then we have a new house. Unbelievable!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, nuclear power is a lot like the Liberal Party: no help to anyone today, completely wrong for Australia's future and notorious for waste that takes forever to clean up. But we've been cleaning up their waste. This farce shouldn't come as a surprise. This is the mob who thought the NBN should be built not with fibre but with copper wire. This is the mob that were promising commuter car parks where there were no train stations. It's amazing they're so opposed to turbines when you consider how much wind they generate over and over again. The climate is changing, but they never will. They had 22 policies on energy in opposition. Now they've come up with a 23rd, but they can't land it. They couldn't land it in government, and they couldn't land it in opposition. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that, during their decade in office, 24 of the country's coal-fired power stations announced they would close. Eight of them actually closed on their watch, in spite of the fact they had a prime minister who would come in here with a lump of coal saying that it was all okay and they didn't need to act. The truth is that they left a mess. They left a mess when it came to the need to have a proper energy policy. We've got one. We look forward to them announcing their policy when they sort out those four little issues. </span>

That's their position as they go forward. They say there won't be any utes. They say that it will all go backwards. The fact is that what we have, as the member for Bradfield repeatedly said when he was the minister—he put forward the case for the need to have proper emissions standards. </span>

We're putting forward a proposition which, when we were the opposition and this minister approached this shadow minister for transport, we said yes to. We said, 'We will provide support for this reform because it is in Australia's national interest.'

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  I thank the member for Makin for the question and for the commitment that he shares with every member of this government, that we want people to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. I just want to focus on one particular example, because we've often gone to the big statistics in terms of what's happening with real wages now returning in terms of growth or what's been happening with the gender pay gap getting to its lowest level ever. I want to just focus on one employer and one set of laws and what changed on laws that this side supported and those opposite opposed. That is the change that went through with secure jobs, better pay, which was to abolish the zombie agreements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This article came out when parliament wasn't sitting, but I think we should refer to it. It was by David Marin-Guzman in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> at the end of last year. The article referred to a labour hire company called AWX, which is a subsidiary of PeopleIN. That labour hire company had an old zombie agreement that dated back to 2004. When we've talked about zombie agreements before, we've talked about them in the context that they mean a particular company has an unfair advantage against their competitors. But when a labour hire company has a zombie agreement it means they can go to every single workplace and offer rates of pay that are not only below an enterprise agreement but below what the award rate had become.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For this particular subsidiary, the Sunday penalty rate—they covered people on the Restaurant Industry Award—that they were able to offer was $12 an hour less than the award rate of pay. It was $12 an hour less on a Sunday than the minimum rate of pay for the award. Now, you can imagine what that meant. They could go from business to business. Even if you didn't have an enterprise agreement, if an employer was paying the lowest amount that was meant to be the legal minimum, this labour hire company could come in and say, 'We can undercut that.' We had argued that that principle needed to be fixed in opposition. Those opposite voted against it when they were in government. They have voted against it now that they're in opposition. It meant that people were able to be paid $160 a week less than if they were directly employed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When those opposite say, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that they will have a targeted package of reforms on industrial relations, we know exactly who it's targeted against. It's targeted against casuals, targeted against job security and targeted against closing the gender pay gap—targeted against ordinary Australian workers.</span>

                  </a>  During the Liberal Party party room this morning, I advised my colleagues that the Labor Party would be completely hypocritical to attack any policy on nuclear—firstly in relation to waste, because they had signed up to disposal of waste under AUKUS. Secondly, I made the point in relation to safety. They would find it hard to criticise a policy on safety given that they had decided to house the nuclear submarines at Henderson, a matter of kilometres from residential suburbs, and in Osborne in South Australia, where submarines would regularly, for decades, be docked within kilometres of those suburbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third point I made was in relation to location. I said they'll find it hard to criticise that, because we've said that we would restrict the locations to a handful of sites which are end-of-life coal fired generators—bring them to an end—and bring in latest zero-emissions nuclear technology. In relation to cost, I said that the Labor Party would find it hard to dispute that, because, as we know, in Ontario, it costs 50 per cent less than what we pay here for electricity, and, in the US, it is one-third of the cost. I made the point that we had a little more work to do in relation to the cost aspect and that we would make our decision and our policy known in due course. So for the Prime Minister to come in here today to again show how weak he is as a leader, how pathetic he is as a prime minister, should come as no surprise to anyone. </span>

If those two are in then I don't think that is going to help the order of the House, so I ask you to consider that, because, as you know, Speaker, I personally have a great respect for order in the House, as do all my colleagues, and we would like to see that good order continue. </span>

The first of them was used 15 times by the now Leader of the Opposition in the last term, so they've certainly been used in the House; they've been used at this dispatch box by your leader. I just offer that for context.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="231027" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TAYLOR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  Before the election, this Prime Minister promised that Australians would be better off under his government. He didn't promise it once; he promised it many times over. In fact, his $275 promise on electricity prices was made 96 times. He promised cheaper mortgages. He promised a broader lower cost of living. He promised 1.2 million more houses over five years. But none of these things have come to fruition; not one of these things has come to fruition. Australians are experiencing a collapse in their standard of living, a collapse the likes of which we haven't seen in our lifetimes, and right at the heart of it is a huge increase in taxes being paid. We're paying a 20 per cent increase in personal tax, a 12 per cent increase in interest rates, a 10 per cent increase in prices on average of many, many items that are absolutely essential to the household budget and a 27 per cent increase to gas prices, which is substantially more, just to take an example. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are experiencing a family recession. The latest economic update that came out in the last week or so confirms that Labor has been missing in action on managing the economy. The Prime Minister and his team have spent the last year wasting time on their $450 million frolic for the Voice referendum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians scraped through the pandemic only to find life harder than ever, with less to show for it. There is a better way, and I'll come back to that in a moment, but it is worth dwelling for a moment on what happens to our economy. We are facing a GDP per person recession. At the end of the day the only thing that matters to someone in the economy is what they're feeling, what the family is feeling, what the household is feeling, what the small businesses of Australia are feeling. As I said, after two years of Labor, they haven't seen it so bad, with higher taxes, higher prices and higher mortgage rates. The economy is grinding to a halt, and the sad reality is that we have got to a point where the only thing left growing in this economy is the population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 12 months we've seen the population grow by 2.6 per cent. Meanwhile, we're seeing the economy growing at only 0.2 per cent per quarter. The sad reality is this is a government that thinks it's okay to have an economy that is only powered by immigration growth—over 500,000 in one year, with population growth over 600,000. Today, we read that the housing requirement for that extra 500,000 is about 75 per cent down on where it needs to be. Only in one in four of the houses required for Australians relative to that population growth is being built. If you dig a little deeper, you see that the combined impact of a 23 per cent increase in personal income taxes being paid, the 10 per cent increase in prices and the 12 interest rate increases has led to a 7½ per cent reduction in disposable income for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see it on the ground wherever we go. I make a point—and I've done this with many of my colleagues behind me here—of going to food banks in my colleagues' electorates to hear and see what Australians are feeling. We're seeing people at food banks who have never been there before. We see people relying on Vinnies, a wonderful organisation, for clothing and other supports who have never required that support before. People who are working, people with double incomes and people with mortgages are all looking for this sort of support under this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cause is straightforward. It is a government that is distracted. It is a government that's spending more time on politics than on managing the economy. It is a government that thought spending a year on a referendum that the Australian people unashamedly rejected last year was a good way to spend its time, rather than focusing on the economy. But the response of Australians is the most striking thing of all. Australians are a stoic lot. If they have a bad government that's doing the wrong thing and making the wrong calls, they cope. But they cope in ways that hurt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, we have almost a million Australians now working a second or third job—almost a million Australians. It's only way they can pay the mortgage or make ends meet. We see Australians, essentially, no longer saving. We saw the savings rate drop to just over one per cent of disposable income. They've essentially given up on saving. If you are a young Australian, the only way you are ever going to own a home is to save the money for a deposit, and they've given up under this government. We know savings rates need to be at seven or eight per cent to be sustainable. They are nowhere near that. We see people cutting back not only on their discretionary spending but also on their non-discretionary spending. When they're cutting back on the food bill, we know things are absolutely desperate. This is supposed to be the lucky country, but Australians aren't feeling lucky under Labor, and it's bad decisions from Labor that are making the difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've already pointed to the mismatch between immigration and housing. Immigration rates are over 500,000. The government itself is forecasting over 1.2 million people immigrating to Australia over the next four years, and every indication is that the number is going to be substantially higher than that. What we also know, as I said, is that only one in four of the houses required is being built. Even on the government's own forecast for housing, they're expecting 20,000 houses a month to be built, and, in fact, they're building about 12,000. I don't know where they think these people are going to go, but I do know that young people I speak to in my electorate and across this country cannot find housing. They cannot find housing because it's simply not there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, there is a better way. That's why we have said that it's right and proper that Australians should be able to access their superannuation for housing. It is a bizarre situation where the only house Australians can't invest in with their super is their own house, but it's a situation that is okay by this government. We see a government that is spending in a way we haven't seen for many, many years. We've seen over $209 billion of additional spending since this government came to power—that's $20,000 per household—and the $450 million referendum is just the beginning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer is a doctor of spin, not a doctor of economics. He hasn't even bothered turning up here today. In the whole time that he has been Treasurer, he's not bothered to turn up to an economic debate like this one. This Treasurer has instead set up a $40 million spin unit. That's what you do when Australians are doing it tough: you set up a spin unit to tell them they've never had it so good. Australians know far better than that. Meanwhile, he is going down a long list of taxes that he's imposing or, no doubt, planning to impose: unrealised capital gains—we haven't seen a government go there before—franking credits, a tourist tax, recycling and clothing. Every farmer under this government is going to see an additional tax when they sell a head of sheep or cattle. It's going to be there on the invoice. They'll see it. This is a government that is very happy to go after farmers, but it's not only going after farmers; it's also going after tradies and families with their utes. It's a government that's happy to say, 'You should pay $15,000 more for your HiLux'—or $14,500, to be exact—and substantially more for many of the most popular cars in Australia.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, we see the energy minister crow because energy prices are not going up as much as they were, having promised a $275 reduction. This is a hapless energy minister who will never deliver the promise that he made to Australians. Meanwhile, we see small-business failures increasing rapidly and exits from the industry increasing at a rapid rate—and I have no doubt that under this government we're going to see far more of the same. There is a better way, but it's not the way that this Labor government has taken us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248353" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:36</span>):  I wasn't sure if the member for Hume would hang on for his MPI today or get himself packing to avoid the scrutiny, but it appears he is still here at the moment. Are you staying, Member for Hume, or going? He's going. He's so deeply interested in this topic, so deeply interested in his own MPI that he's leaving the chamber now. But here we all are, having been reminded of the many ways the opposition is standing in the way of providing cost-of-living relief to working families in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having torched the place with a decade of junk economics, they now have the gall to stand in the way of a proper economic strategy, relief from cost-of-living pressure in a way that does not add to a nation, repair of the budget position and supply chains, the first surplus in 15 years, and reform which lays the foundation for future growth. This is the work of a serious government—hard choices taken to ease financial pressure on Australians and set up our economy for the long term. I acknowledge the leadership of our economics team in this work. I suggest that the Australian community has seen through the bluff and the bluster and the confected outrage of the other side. The good people of Dunkley certainly have. Let me take the chance to put my congratulations to the member for Dunkley, Jodie Belyea, on the record. She will be a fantastic local member for her community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the other side, it looks like they have already bailed out. They have suffered through the rubbish of the member for Hume, holding their breath, hoping he doesn't start talking about Vegemite again, breathing a sigh of relief when it's over and then quickly running for the door, where they've all just gone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to add a small detail to the member's speech, something about his own community, just up the road in New South Wales. There are some 79,000 taxpayers in the member for Hume's electorate, and 68,000 of them will be better off under the Labor's tax cuts than they would have been under the Liberals' plan. For those without a calculator, 68,000 is 86 per cent. In my electorate on the Central Coast of New South Wales, it's 88 per cent—hardworking teachers, nurses, food manufacturers and others who deserve the financial relief that tax cuts will bring. The hardworking staff from Warnervale Public School, whom I welcomed here to Parliament House yesterday with their students, are among the 88 per cent of workers in my community of Dobell who are better off under Labor's tax cuts. This fact repeats over and over around the country, which is why, for all their bluff and bluster and confected outrage, the opposition actually voted for this change. They voted for this change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government wants Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn, and our bigger tax cuts for more taxpayers will help make this happen. Labor's legislation will deliver a tax cut for every taxpayer, and more tax relief for more people to help with the cost of living. As we know, and as the Treasurer says each day, people are still under pressure, and there is more to do. Anyone who listens to their communities understands this deeply. Again, I echo the words of the Prime Minister: it's not the job of a leader to sit back and wring their hands when confronted with new challenges; it's their job to act, to take responsibility and to do the right thing. That is exactly what we're doing with rent assistance, fee-free TAFE, energy bill reductions, housing and, of course, wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said we'd get real wages moving again, and we are. Real wages growth is back and ahead of schedule. Annual real wages grew at the end of last year. The most recent wage figures show a 0.9 per cent rise in the wage price index for the December quarter, meaning wages were 4.2 per cent higher through the year—the equal-fastest annual growth since 2009. This is the first time since 2018 we have seen three consecutive quarters of real wages growth. On this note I will mention aged-care workers, and the invaluable contribution they've made and the proper recognition they will now receive for the work they do providing dignity to older Australians. Since the election, nominal wages have been growing at an annualised average of four per cent—almost double the average under those opposite. We've turned that around in less than two years. The Liberals want people working longer for less, and that meant annual real wages were falling 3.4 per cent, as the Treasurer said in question time today, when we came to office after a decade of deliberate—this was by design—wage suppression and stagnation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to an area of responsibility I have in the health portfolio where major government initiatives are helping ease pressure on Australians: restoring and strengthening Medicare, bringing bulk-billing back from the absolute brink it was at under those opposite, supporting the health workforce and growing access to free, quality urgent care services under Medicare. I've said before that physical and mental health have particular importance in this discussion because health outcomes aren't just a result of access to clinical care, as important as that is; financial security or insecurity itself is a direct driver and important determinant of physical and mental health. Those with financial security generally have better health than those without. Those in work generally have better mental health than those looking for work. As I said, in mental health, when you're under financial strain you are much more likely to experience distress. We see the cost-of-living agenda as a health agenda too, and the government's record investment in Medicare shows how deeply seriously we are taking this task.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor we have brought bulk-billing back to the beating heart of Medicare. In the first two months since the tripling of the GP bulk-billing incentive, we have stopped the absolute freefall that bulk-billing was in under the former government and seen a big increase in the number of Australians getting their GP appointments for free. This is a health measure, this is a cost-of-living measure and this is making a difference in communities right around the country. We should never have Australians putting off visits to the doctor because they simply can't afford to go. It is estimated some 360,000 additional GP consultations were bulk-billed in the first two months of this policy, saving Australians some $15 million in gap fees. I look forward to more data showing more Australians benefiting from bulk-billed GP appointments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to bulk-billed GP appointments, Australians are also benefiting from quality, free health care at 58 Medicare urgent care clinics—more than the number promised in our election commitment and with further growth to come, as the Prime Minister confirmed in question time today. So far there have been more than 225,000 presentations to Medicare urgent care clinics across the country since the first Medicare urgent care clinic opened its doors in June last year. Across the country this represents an estimated potential saving to public hospital emergency departments of over $60 million in avoided patient episodes. This is a health measure and this is a cost-of-living measure, and this is making a real difference to Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Working families have been the main beneficiary of this landmark investment in Medicare. More than one in four patients presenting to urgent care clinics across the country have been under 15. More than one in four visits have taken place over the weekend, and on weekdays one in four visits have taken place after five o'clock. This is showing the real difference. This is a health measure and this is a cost-of-living measure that Australians all around the country are benefiting from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor members in this place are laser focused on practical measures to ease cost-of-living pressure and to set our economy up for a fairer and stronger future. As we know, growth in the Australian economy is subdued but steady in the face of higher interest rates, high but moderating inflation and ongoing global uncertainty. The UK finished the year in recession. Around a quarter of G20 nations have recorded a technical recession or narrowly avoided one. Against that backdrop, the Australian economy grew by 0.2 per cent in the December quarter to be 1.5 per cent higher through the year. It does not help to have the opposition and the member for Hume—who has left the chamber, despite having carriage of this MPI today, and all his bluff and bluster about the Treasurer not being here, whilst he can't remain for his own MPI in the chamber—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against this backdrop, the Australian economy grew by 0.2 per cent in the December quarter, to be 1.5 per cent higher through the year. It does not help to have the opposition here—held up by the member for New England!—scurrying around on a scare campaign, the member for Hume trying to impress his colleagues, sitting idly by. This Labor government is improving cost of living. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247742" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOWARTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  Australians are doing it tough, but, listening to the member for Dobell, it seems everything's hunky-dory: Australians aren't doing it tough; everything's great. In a 10-minute speech, probably 20 seconds were devoted to, 'We need to do a little bit better on the cost of living.' When it comes to Dobell, I guess people aren't paying more rent, people aren't paying higher mortgages, people aren't paying more for insurance. I guess the member for Dobell must have delivered that $275 reduction in electricity prices. So, for the people in Lemon Tree, Long Jetty and Palm Dale and other places in Dobell, everything's sweet since the Albanese government was elected, according to the member for Dobell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the truth is that Australians know they are doing it tough. They know the Prime Minister couldn't be trusted when he said that things would be better off under him, that life would be better under him. People know they have been struggling for the last two years. The record shows that under the coalition people had more savings in their bank accounts, people had more dollars in their pocket, people had a greater disposable income. People weren't having to work two or three jobs, as the member for Hume said, under the coalition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government come in here day after day talking about more women being in employment. The reason more women are back to work is that they're struggling; their mortgages have doubled, their cost of living has gone through the roof, they're having to put groceries back on the shelf when the kids pick them up. That's why they're back to work—nothing to do with what the Leader of the House has done. The minister for industrial relations comes in here and says he's saved the country, that everything's hunky-dory under him. The reality is that prices have gone up because of their actions, because of their legislating for their union donors. That's what Labor governments do. It's what they'll always do. Whilst the rules allow them to take that money from the unions, they'll come into this place and act in the best interests of their donors, not in the best interests of you and other Australians throughout this place. That is the absolute reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After almost two years of Labor, Australians' quality of life has fallen dramatically, with higher income taxes, higher inflation and low productivity. They talk about income taxes, but the government wouldn't be doing anything around income taxes if the former coalition government hadn't already legislated to cut them from 1 July. That is the absolute reality. There's not a member on this side of the House who advocates for income taxes any day of the week. In fact, in the last two years all they've done is say, 'How do we actually get rid of those legislated stage 3 tax cuts?'—that you said you wouldn't cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that businesses are also suffering. Small businesses are suffering. For every man, woman and child in Australia, the economy is going backwards; there is less money in their pockets. That's what the figures produced last week say and what the shadow Treasurer, the member for Hume, spoke about today. Workplaces are more inefficient—workplaces are not as productive—because of the workplace laws that this government has introduced. Businesses are now more worried about trying to work out the definition of a casual. What is the definition of a casual? We're not sure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is fear and uncertainty over the right to disconnect. Now, how many members here—there are quite a few members in the House—have actually had someone come up to them and say, 'I'm really worried about my boss calling me after hours; I'm really worried about being sent an email after hours'? I've been a member here for 10 years and haven't had one person raise that with me. But now you've got small businesses around the country saying: 'You know what? I might not put on that extra employee.' And unemployment is rising under the Albanese government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's the duplication. For years in Queensland we've had legislation addressing wage theft, and the federal government introduced the same legislation but doesn't talk to the current legislation in Queensland. Capital expenditure is down. People are not investing in their businesses, because the Albanese government have wound back the instant asset tax write-off. And now we have one employee in every 15 whose full-time job is to deal with compliance and regulation. That is the Albanese government's legacy. SMEs have stopped growing. They've stopped employing. They're finding it tough. And Australians have given up on the Albanese government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300122" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  It's always a pleasure to follow such an illustrious contribution from the member opposite! The reality is that everybody in this House, everybody in this parliament, and especially everybody in the Albanese Labor government is acutely aware that people across our communities have been doing it very tough for a protracted period of time now. But working people are not mugs. They know that the conditions that have led to these challenging circumstances weren't made overnight and they're not isolated to Australia. Many times in this chamber, across the public discourse, we have discussed the issues related to inflation in our economy, many of which began as part of an international inflation problem, and we see the reverberations of that international problem across all economies, including many of our peer economies in the developed world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that, compared with other economies across the world, Australia is doing relatively better—that's true: relatively better. But I come back to that point I made at the beginning: people across our communities are still doing it very, very tough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in any household budget—indeed, really in any budget at all—there are the revenues coming in and the costs going out. In order to address the challenges that our households face, we need to look at both ends of their budgets. That's what the Albanese government has been relentlessly focused on, since we were elected: how we can support families, households, across our community with the cost of living by looking at both the revenue and the costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about revenue at a household level, I know that some of those opposite measure their revenue in terms of their returns from their Gold Coast apartment investments, or their family businesses that are essentially chains of childcare centres that return revenues. But, for working people, we are talking about wages. Wages are the revenues of the households of working people. So our government has relentlessly pursued the policies and the actions that lead to real wage growth for Australian workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the worst decade, under the former Liberal government, for real wage growth in our country's history, and only in the last three quarters have we started to see positive real wage growth returning for Australian workers. The most recent wage figures showed a nearly one per cent—a 0.9 per cent—wage increase in the wage price index in the December quarter, and that brings the annualised wage price index to 4.2 per cent higher throughout that year. That's the fastest growth for real wages in Australia since 2009, when Labor was last in government. It's the first time since 2018 that we've even seen three consecutive quarters of real wage growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has been relentlessly focused on the revenue side of household budgets, in order to increase wages by any means necessary, for working people. At the other end of household budgets, we have the costs. We know, due to those international pressures across energy markets and food and groceries, as well as some of our own domestic challenges, particularly in relation to the weather events that we've had, that some of those household costs have been growing at a faster rate than households are able to absorb.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, again, we have worked relentlessly to try and reduce the costs, reduce the outgoings, of households and working people across our economy. The best way that we can do that is to introduce—and, indeed, it had the lukewarm support of those opposite—cost-of-living tax cuts for every single Australian taxpayer. Every Australian taxpayer will be getting a tax cut from 1 July. Every single Australian taxpayer will see that tax cut showing up in their pay packet every single month or fortnight, depending on their pay cycle. We are addressing the revenue issues and we're addressing the cost issues. The Albanese Labor government is ensuring that our economy is fit for working people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  Electricity and gas bills are up, grocery bills are up, petrol prices are up and mortgage repayments and rents are up, yet today the Albanese Labor government were out patting themselves on the back when it came to electricity prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that people in Western Sydney have been paying 37 per cent more on their bills since the Albanese Labor government came into power. The relief expected from the energy regulator on the market default offer that came in today would have had to have been cut by $1,000 for the reality of the $275 cut promised by the Albanese Labor government to come to fruition. But it didn't happen; it didn't happen at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are really struggling out there. Congratulating yourselves and patting yourselves on the back while people are doing it so tough is absolutely extraordinary, because we are once again in the Albanese Labor government's economic mess. It's taken just two years to trash our economy and send us hurtling towards another spiral in the depths of our cost-of-living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now everyday Australians right up and down the coasts of Australia, inland, in the regions and particularly in Western Sydney, my patch, are facing a per capita recession. This means economic growth per person is going backwards in this country. For families, this means they are facing a recession. The Prime Minister, many times, committed to the public at the election that he would ensure—he actually said, 'I promise you: you are going to be better off under us.' Instead, the cost of living, the standard of living, in this country is going backwards. People in Penrith, Fairfield, Parramatta and Liverpool are all hurting under the economic policies of this government. We need a coalition government to deliver the right policy settings to move our country in the right direction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Labor took office, we've had higher taxes, higher inflation and lower productivity. Consumer confidence is down, and you know this. Just walk into a cafe—I do this all the time with small businesses in my electorate—and ask, 'How is business going?' They say: 'Customers are just not coming through the door. We are threatened with closing every single day.' I get contacted by small-business operators saying yet another small business has closed. Whether in retail, hospitality or manufacturing, small businesses are closing their doors because they just can't afford to stay open under this Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing mums and dads selling their family home because they can't afford the tripling of interest payments on their mortgage. And we know, because it's happening in every single electorate in this country, that for the first time families on double incomes are lining up at food banks. I've been to schools in my local electorate and given grants to them so they can have a fridge and shelves in their schools—pantries to put food in—so kids can be fed during the day because parents are struggling to give them breakfast and lunch for school. This should not be happening in our country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Sydney, we know that we are just buckling under the weight of the government's migration program, especially when billions of dollars have been slashed from our infrastructure and transport projects. We simply cannot keep up with the demand to live in our region without adequate support to ensure our roads, our trains, our metros, our schools, our hospitals and our employment hubs are able to cope with a rising population. I'm not surprised that people want to live in Western Sydney. We are an aspirational community, and we have a new international airport which creates so many local jobs, so kids don't have to travel out of the area for a job. But, while the planes might be taking off, you can't get to that airport because the infrastructure on the roads has been cut by government—billions of dollars cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of mortgages, the Reserve Bank board has met 19 times since Labor came to office, and it has increased interest rates 12 times. Again, the government is patting itself on the back and saying, 'Oh, but today they didn't do that.' But there have been 12 interest rate rises. This is why people are struggling so much under this Labor Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about taxes, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy wants to put a tradie tax in place. People in my community are going to love this! Tradies on the road will not be able to afford the cost of their utes and the cost of transport to get to their jobs. This cost-of-living crisis is impacting so many Australians. It's time for Labor to wake up and create policies to fix their mess.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="290544" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ANANDA-RAJAH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  If the Liberals actually cared about the living standards of Australians, they would not have presided over a moribund decade of low productivity. It was the lowest decade of productivity growth that we have seen in 60 years. If they actually cared about the living standards of Australians, they would not have presided over energy secrecy and energy chaos—22 policies and a failure to land even one. Now they've cooked up, in their cooker's laboratory, the nuclear frolic. We are just watching as this narrative crashes and burns with the Australian people. I'm really pleased that they are taking this to the next election, because we can finally apply some scrutiny and science to these claims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If they actually cared about the living standards of Australians, they would not have presided over galloping, out-of-control childcare costs. In fact, they rose 41 per cent in the decade that those opposite presided over. They would not have presided over the collapse of bulk billing. They would not have watched as wages stalled and stagnated. They would not have watched economy-wide skill shortages in this country which in turn fed into the supply-chain problems that we had when the pandemic washed over us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If they actually cared about the living standards of Australians, they would not have burdened young Australians with $1 trillion in debt and nothing to show for it—or not enough to show for it. If they actually cared about Australians' living standards, they would not have presided over the housing crisis. The decline in housing started in around 2016, and it has been in freefall ever since. Now we are trying to turn this supertanker around. If they actually cared about Australians' living standards, they would have offered Australians the best fuel-saving technology in cars a decade ago. Instead, Australia is a laggard with respect to fuel efficiency standards. Australians have been denied the most fuel-efficient cars for over a decade while those opposite were in power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the reality is that those opposite never cared about Australians; they cared about themselves. You only had to watch <span style="font-style:italic;">Nemesis</span> to confirm that. It was all about their politics; it was nothing to do with the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have come to power, and now we are here to clean up their economic mess. Our focus is on delivering as much relief as we can—and that's what we've done, over two budgets—to the Australian people. With respect to one area, health, for example, we have given Australians to more affordable and accessible health care. We have rolled out 58 urgent care clinics around the country, including one in Prahran in my electorate. This clinic is currently diverting at least 20 patients from the emergency department to the clinic, and that's lowering the pressure on our overburdened hospital system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also delivered cheaper medicines for Australians. This has come in the form of 60-day scripts, which have already saved around $13 million for Australians over the last two months. It comes off the back of cheaper medicines and our cut to the price of a general script from $42.50 to $30, saving Australians around $20 million a month in the year since it was introduced. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also given Australians more access to immunisations on the National Immunisation Program through their local pharmacy. For example, the Shingrix vaccine, a highly effective vaccine against shingles, is now available free to all Australians over the age of 65, immunocompromised patients and First Nations patients who are 50 years or over. This vaccine normally costs $600, but you can get it for free because we have enabled that to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, we have bedded down these cheaper medicine reforms with an agreement with the community pharmacies sector—$3 billion. That has only come about because of our economic management, which has allowed us to have the first budget surplus in 15 years, something those opposite talked and talked about. They talked a big game, but they could not deliver. We've delivered it, and it has enabled us to provide more relief to Australian families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Child care is an incredibly important issue for families. In Higgins, families spend the highest amount on child care in Victoria, and the reforms we introduced have brought welcome relief to those families. </span>

I have the utmost respect for the member for Higgins; I want to put that out there.

So I do want to commend her and thank her on behalf of the nation for the work that she has done in the medical field. </span>

                  </a>  I hear, 'Hear, hear,' from the member for Sydney. And I do acknowledge it; I am being genuine. But to say that the Liberals—and Nationals, by the way; we were a coalition government—did nothing in 10 years is to completely erase what happened during COVID. I look around and there is not one member in this chamber at the moment who was in that meeting when we were told by the Chief Medical Officer that 40,000 Australians would die unless we acted. We acted. And we saved many, many lives—thousands of lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am slow to anger, but it irritates me a lot when the Treasurer in question time today and the previous speaker say that we have nothing to show for what we did as a government. We do have something to show, and it's tens of thousands of people's lives. I think that if you were being fair you would, as a doctor, also acknowledge that. It is important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This matter of public importance is about the economy; it is about the nation and it is important. When you think that a recession of sorts—the way it's been described in this matter of public importance goes to the core of what people are able to take home now. People are taking home less, and real wages are falling. Don't take my word for it. I'm not reading off talking points. I'm talking about the anecdotal evidence that you hear from everybody. When you go to meetings, when you go to sporting events and when you go into your electorates, you hear just how tough people are doing it. And no doubt you are hearing it too. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the Reserve Bank of Australia has held steady on interest rates today. Thank goodness for that, because it is so hard for people—certainly for those who are new in the homebuying market—to achieve what used to be the great Australian dream. When you talk about the economy, you see the Labor government wanting to put more taxes in. They're wanting to charge our farmers a biosecurity levy. Let's call it what it is; it is a tax. They want to charge our farmers for their competitors' goods coming in from overseas. We are going to be slugging our farmers. What country on earth would be so preposterous, so ridiculous, as to even contemplate that, let alone want to legislate it through their national parliament? Then we have the fuel efficiency standards. It has been described by the member for Lindsay as a tradies tax, and she's right. It's also a tax on the mums who want to carry their kids around to sporting events, dancing performances and all of those things. For people with families and growing families, it is going to be a slug on their ability to have the SUV.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier today I heard a horrendous story about the town of Tom Price in Western Australia, population 2,874 last time they counted. That community, which is in the Ashburton shire of Western Australia is responsible, with the shire's output, for—wait for it—two per cent of the nation's GDP. That's a lot of money, and yet it doesn't have a bank. The Treasurer, instead of maligning the previous government's economic record, should be asking questions as to why that community doesn't have a financial organisation, why that community's people have to put cash in suitcases and drive it down to Perth, why the nearest bank is about 360 kilometres away. These are the issues that everyday, ordinary Australians are asking, and they're not being by those opposite. They're not being addressed by the government and they should be. These are the bread-and-butter issues. Instead of coming in and getting your talking points and reading them ad nauseam, do something that's constructive for and on behalf of Australians, particularly regional Australians, who carried this nation through COVID. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  We're not even two years into the Albanese Labor government, yet we are making huge progress in cleaning up the mess left behind by nine years of waste and neglect by those opposite. We are making huge progress putting this country back on the right track, and even though we are cleaning up their mess, the coalition have been no help to us at all. In fact, they have actively stood in the way of our efforts again and again, voting no on important government actions that are easing the cost-of-living burden and improving the quality of life for everyday Australians. They voted no to the cost-of-living tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer. They voted no to a bigger tax cut for more workers. The Labor government wants workers to earn more and keep more of what they earn. Instead, the Liberals and Nationals want workers to work longer hours for less. They voted no to cheaper medicines. They voted no to energy bill relief. When it comes to the cost of living, the coalition becomes the 'no-alition'. They always say no. But we're getting on with it anyway. On top of our cost-of-living tax cuts, we're rolling out billions in cost-of-living relief, including rent assistance, energy rebates, cheaper medicines, income support, Medicare bulk-billing incentives and much more. We are getting on with it because we understand families' budgets are tight right now and that the impact of cost-of-living pressures and inflation are being felt around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a government that is in touch and is listening. I'd hate to imagine how much harder things would be for Australians if the coalition's reign of waste and neglect had continued. Thankfully, the Australian people put the adults in charge. We have taken the responsibility of cleaning up and rebuilding our country seriously. We have focused on making life better for Australians, and our efforts are bearing fruit every day. Just this morning, the Australian Energy Regulator released its draft default market offer for electricity prices for the next financial year, 2024-25. The new default market offer will see electricity price reductions all over Australia. Under our leadership, energy prices are stabilising and trending downwards. This is big news for my electorate—the draft default market offer sees electricity prices falling up to 6.7 per cent for residential customers in the Hunter. There is even bigger news for small businesses in my electorate, with planned falls in electricity prices of up to 13 per cent for business customers. These forecast electricity price falls will make a difference for families right across Australia, and especially so for families in the Hunter. These forecast falls in electricity prices are a result of clear economic leadership from the Albanese Labor government. Under those opposite we had a decade of coalition infighting, which completely undermined much-needed investment in our new energy production. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, a united team, have given investors certainty, clearing the way for much-needed investment in our energy market. Under the Labor government renewable energy production is booming and upgrades to our energy transmission networks are under way that will set up our country the right way into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we did not just sit around waiting for prices to come down. Unlike those opposite, who are out of touch, on this side of the House we listen to Australians. We understand that people are doing it tough. We're here to do something about it. When electricity prices rose, we provided energy price relief to around five million households and small businesses across Australia. This direct relief, combined with coal and gas price caps, offset energy price rises for so many Australians. Now that prices are stabilising and heading in the right direction, things will be better going into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of the future, we are two years into cleaning up the nine years of waste by the coalition. But we have much more to do. We will continue to do everything we can to help Australian families, to help small businesses. We will keep supporting Australians without contributing to inflation. We will keep real wages growing. We will keep the economy moving. We will keep the budget in good shape, unlike those opposite. We will keep creating more secure and well-paid jobs, unlike those opposite. We are just getting started. We have so much more to do in this space, and I look forward to what's to come.</span>

                  </a>  If you look at the budget papers, Member for Hawke, you can find that it was $418 billion. About $250 billion of that came from the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. So if you are going to regurgitate talking points, make sure they are accurate. Don't listen to what the Treasurer is giving you, because it's not accurate. This is what happens on that side.

                  </a>  I will take the interjections, because I know they don't like the facts. But the facts are that it was never a trillion. It didn't exist; it was made up. So I will take the interjections from those opposite. We are actually talking about an issue that is significant and serious, and talking points won't cut it. We're talking about the cost-of-living crisis that Australians are facing and the per capita recession that Australians are going through. Last week, when I was in my community, I was filling up with petrol and I took a moment, by coincidence, to see the price of what the person before me had put into the tank. They had put $30 worth of petrol into their tank, and they got just over 13 litres for that $30. Let's be honest. Those of us in this House sometimes can put our petrol in and not look at it.</span>

                  </a>  They're interjecting again. It's an example of how much Australians are struggling. That's why, when the shadow Treasurer asked the Treasurer today about the per capita recession, what was the response from this Prime Minister? This Prime Minister sits in that chair and laughs. He laughs at the Australian people, who are struggling with the cost of living, when they get a question about per capita recessions. It's a laughing matter for this Prime Minister. He sat in that chair two hours ago and laughed at the cost of living per capita recession Australians are going through. Because they've solved the problem with $15 a week in four months time. They're going to give the Australian people $15 a week, which is about 6.5 litres of petrol in my community, in four months time. Problem solved. And you know that it's problem solved because the Treasurer himself has told us. He has told us that's it. Good luck to the Australian people. I'm going to quote from the Treasurer of Australia: 'There will likely be additional cost-of-living help in the budget.' But it won't be anywhere near the magnitude of the tax cuts, so it's nowhere near $15 a week for the Australian people. He also said, 'We need to be upfront and say any additional help will only be a fraction of that.' Wow. How out of touch are this Prime Minister and this Treasurer, laughing at the cost-of-living crisis, telling the Australian people that $15 a week in four months time will solve all their problems? It is a government that is out of touch. It is a Prime Minister that is not prepared to make the tough decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To show how cynical this Prime Minister and this government are: the member for Hume talked about food banks. Anyone who's taken the time to visit a food bank in their community knows that they're struggling with increased demand and costs going up. They're under significant pressure. Every food bank I speak to in my community is busier than ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what did this government do? I'll give them credit here; I'll give credit where it's due. They gave $14 million to support food banks across the country. Given the cost-of-living crisis that we're seeing under this government, it's better than nothing. But what did they do at the exact same time that they gave food banks $14 million? They committed $40 million to selling their stage 3 tax cuts of $15 a week. So there is $14 million for food banks and $40 million of taxpayer money to sell their tax cuts, which come in in four months. What do you need to sell to the Australian people? Oh, that's right: it's all about the spin. It's all about the politics for this government. They can say what they like, but look at their actions: $14 million for food banks and $40 million to sell their stage 3 tax cuts to hold on in Dunkley and leave the Australian people fending for themselves. The Treasurer has told us that himself. He's told us there's nothing in the upcoming budget that's worth more than $15 a week. The Australian people have been abandoned by this Prime Minister, this Treasurer and this government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The debate today gives me a great chance to speak about the Albanese government's policies and how they are supporting not only the economy but also residents in my community. We have over the last few years lived through the most extraordinary and challenging period. Jobs have been lost, families have been separated and loved ones have passed away. It's been a very awful time, particularly in suburbs in south-west Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the global economy is now facing several challenges that have been compounded over the past years. Persistently high inflation has affected the majority of the developed world, fuelled by the lingering effects of COVID and the illegal invasion of Ukraine. There has also been a sharp slowdown in the economic activity of Australia's largest trading partner and the world's second-largest economy, China. This is the context in which the MPI has been brought forward, though it's this context which has been conveniently omitted by the member for Hume.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At home, Australia faces challenges similar to those of the rest of the developed world: high inflation and slowing growth. High inflation has defined the past few years, and it's been the focus of this government to put downward pressure on inflation while simultaneously laying the foundations for a stronger economy and helping Australians that are doing it tough. Inflation remains the primary focus of this government. Thankfully, though the fight is definitely not over, inflation is moderating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings us to the second challenge facing our economy: slowing growth. While it may come as a surprise to the shadow Treasurer, if he'd listened to the Treasurer over the past year, he would have heard him speak about the middle path that the economy must travel between lowering inflation and aiming for a soft landing. It's complex. There are no easy answers, no quick slogans, no magic wands and no throwaway lines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and, in fact, the entire government turn their efforts to addressing the concerns of Australians and building our economy. It's also the Labor way to ensure that any solutions and government actions are responsible and sustainable. We can run through the suite of policies that the Albanese government has adopted since 2022 that have provided cost-of-living relief in a time of high inflation and kept an eye on the future, building resilience. These include the 300,000 fee-free TAFE places; the investment in renewable energy, skills and technology; expanding the Home Guarantee Scheme; increasing the wages of aged-care workers; establishing the $15 billion NRF to diversify our economy; tripling the bulk-billing incentive; making medicines cheaper with 60-day dispensing and the largest reduction in the PBS copayment in 75 years; and getting wages moving again after the years of deliberate wage suppression during the time of the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has kept unemployment low and created a record 650,000 jobs since being elected. In fact, there have been more jobs created by our current PM than by any of the previous three prime ministers. I ask: which of these measures did those opposite believe were wrong for our economy? Was it increasing wages for workers both in our aged-care sector and across our economy, or was it the fee-free TAFE places that upskill Australians and ensure that they can work in the jobs of the future? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would seem that the only policy that is new to those opposite is nuclear energy, the most expensive form of power generation, which will require billions in government subsidies—not supporting protections for Australian workers, not letting Australians raid their super or reintroducing tax concessions for the wealthiest Australians. That seems to be the only plan that those opposite have. They have no vision and no plan for a better Australia, but they do have policies that would hurt workers both today and in their retirement. And they delayed Australia's energy transition for 10 long years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I know with certainty is that this government will always put the interests and needs of Australians first. It is the core of everything we do and it motivates all of us every day. I am confident that the work of our responsible government will continue and that better days lie ahead. </span>

For this to be possible, it accordingly calls on the government to remove the separate set of procedures under the Migration Act 1958 from the bill so that procedures that apply to applicants generally also apply to migrant and refugee applicants. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… where it is separate … for migration applicants, the code is always more punitive and restrictive than the general ART provisions. It is very disappointing that migrants should continue to be treated as persons with inferior procedural entitlements. Specifically, at a time when almost one in two Australians were either born overseas or have an overseas born parent, we should stop seeing migrants as less worthy of procedural entitlements just because they are non-citizens. This is most especially the case where applications can involve matters of life and death—or profound disruption to human rights, including the right to live with a partner and immediate family. </span>

The report indicates that significant numbers of people experience prejudice and discrimination routinely in everyday life and that attitudes to government and democracy in this country are now politically charged and polarised. In this context, why are we seeking to establish, through this legislation, yet another separate standard of treatment for those asking for protection and a better life in this country? We cannot continue on this trajectory. We need to come back to our values as a nation, back to community, back to embracing diversity and back to basic human rights. </span>

Citizens or noncitizens, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect for their basic human rights, and we must ensure this core belief is upheld in this new legislation, for the power of human rights is in their universality. Every human being is born equal and deserving of justice, and equality before the law, a right enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, is essential for fair decision-making.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ANANDA-RAJAH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  The Administrative Appeals Tribunal reviews Commonwealth government decisions in areas such as migration, social services, the NDIS and veterans' affairs. It affects every component of our lives, and it's an important body of oversight over government decisions. Every year, thousands of people rely on the AAT to independently review government decisions that can have significant impacts on their lives—decisions such as whether an old Australian receives the age pension, whether a veteran is compensated for a service injury or whether a participant in the NDIS receives funding for essential support. Critically, high-quality review of government decision-making will encourage better-quality decision-making across government. It should be a virtuous cycle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, we inherited an AAT that was fatally flawed. It was stacked with Liberal cronies—some 85 former staffers, failed candidates or mates of the Liberal Party, people lacking the requisite expertise. It was bedevilled with ageing electronic systems and heading to financial oblivion from a botched amalgamation of the AAT with a hotchpotch of other tribunals by the former Liberal government. The AAT we inherited was beset with delays and a large and growing backlog of applications, often affecting some of the most vulnerable members of our community. As an example, victims of robodebt appealed to the AAT but found that decisions adverse to the Morrison government were not escalated either internally within the AAT or to the Federal Court. In other words, questions raised in the AAT about the legality of robodebt were effectively buried by the former government. I note that there were also cases where the AAT effectively rubberstamped the program's legality. Had the AAT been a robust check and balance system, robodebt might never have occurred. It might have been stopped in its tracks. As the robodebt royal commission noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Effective merits review is an essential part of the legal framework that protects the rights and interests of individuals; it also promotes government accountability and plays a broader … role in improving the quality and consistency of government decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS is no different. In the six months before we came to government, the NDIA spent more than $28 million fighting appeals in the AAT. Over 4,500 NDIS participants had complaints stuck with the AAT, an increase of 400 per cent on the previous year. Thanks to the Minister for Government Services and Minister for the NDIS, more than 90 per cent of those cases have now been resolved, and we now have 30 per cent fewer cases being referred to the AAT in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General has introduced legislation—the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023 and related bills—that would abolish the AAT and establish a new body, to be named the Administrative Review Tribunal. The tribunal would be user focused, efficient, accessible, independent and fair, with a focus on addressing backlogs and earlier resolution. The Albanese government will also restore the oversight body for the AAT, called the Administrative Review Council. Abolished by the Abbott government in 2015, the ARC—the council—will be re-established in accordance with a key recommendation of the robodebt royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General announced that the design of a new body would be the subject of consultation beginning early last year, and it was. The bills have been informed by the outcomes of public and targeted consultation, guidance from the Administrative Review Expert Advisory Group, chaired by former High Court Justice the Hon. Patrick Keane, and close engagement across government with the AAT. In the words of the Attorney-General:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This package of legislation is transformative. It is ambitious and comprehensive—we are building an institution that is intended to serve the community and drive better decisions for many years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tribunal would be required to pursue the objective of providing administrative review that is fair and just, that resolves applications in a timely manner with as little formality and expense as necessary, that is accessible and responsive to the diverse needs of parties, that improves the transparency and quality of government decision-making and that promotes public trust and confidence in the tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A central feature of the new tribunal will be a transparent and merits based selection process for the appointment of non-judicial members—a merits based focus, not 'jobs for mates'. Structure and membership will include: a president; deputy presidents, both judicial and non-judicial; senior members; and general members. The streamlined membership structure responds to feedback that the AAT's seven membership levels are confusing and arbitrary. The tribunal will be made up of eight jurisdictional areas—general; intelligence and security; migration; the National Disability Insurance Scheme, or NDIS; protection; social security; taxation; and business—as well as veterans and workers compensation. This structure builds in flexibility to ensure an enduring responsive foundation for the tribunal's work into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A tribunal advisory committee will provide strong collective leadership to the tribunal, comprising the president, the principal registrar and the jurisdictional area leaders. The committee will ensure that those leaders are individually and jointly responsible for promoting the tribunal's objective. A transparent and merits based selection process for members is provided for in the bill. The suitability of prospective members will be assessed through a competitive merits based and publicly advertised process. We welcome applicants to these roles. The assessment will consider how well candidates fulfil the skills, expertise, experience and knowledge required to be a member of the tribunal, as you would expect in any high office. This assessment must also consider the need for a diversity of skills, expertise and lived experience, noting that the tribunal should reflect the community it serves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through significant reforms to the Migration Act, the bill would assist to reduce delays and backlogs in migration and refugee matters, increase fairness and support the integrity of the migration system. One of the provisions also contains measures to enable the transition from the AAT to the new tribunal. This includes transitioning active, pending and potential case loads, including matters before the courts, to minimise disruption and to maintain review rights. For those who are in the process of having a decision reviewed by the AAT and who may request a review as the new body, the ART, is being set up, these cases will be transitioned to the new body automatically. There will be no need to submit a new application.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms to the AAT build upon a broad integrity agenda that we brought to office, and the centrepiece, of course, is the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, the NACC. However, this ART that we will be establishing is a really important measure because it acts as an important check and balance to executive power where the voices of ordinary Australians will be elevated and due process will be followed so that these Australians are not left by the wayside, as happened with robodebt. Robodebt, which had a royal commission, is a stain on Australia's history and one that we do not want to repeat. Reforming important oversight bodies like the AAT into a new body with a spill of the current members enables a complete reset and a process of healing to occur in this nation. Once the new tribunal has been established, all ongoing and non-ongoing Public Service employees employed by the AAT at the time will transition to this new tribunal on equivalent terms and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this package of bills to the House. It's the most important reform of the federal system of administrative review for decades, to restore integrity to, and to improve the effectiveness of, the review system for Commonwealth decisions. I thank the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  There's a cancer in modern politics—a cancer corroding the core of our national life. The cancer relates to misunderstanding the purpose of politics in our national life. The foundation of our liberal democracy is the understanding that we will, at times, disagree—that we will bring different philosophical perspectives to debate and discussion of issues. The recognition that we will disagree is at the heart of our system of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day this House sits, we see children up in the glassed-in public galleries watch us through that soundproof glass. We teach our children about the architecture of our civic life: the parliament, the courts, the Crown, the free press, our democracy. But, sadly, we don't teach them the ethos that lies behind them. That ethos is that there will always be differences and that good people can disagree—that they can disagree on one thing and work together on another—and, though there are differences, those differences shouldn't disqualify anyone from making a contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many things wrong with the government's approach towards the reconstitution of the AAT, but the foundational error is the belief that a good system should be overturned because of the party affiliation or involvement of some within it. The Attorney's fundamental argument for overturning a system in place for decades is that there have been Liberals involved on the AAT—not just people who'd served in this place or in the Senate, or who'd worked as advisers, but people who did nothing more than join a political party. If it sounds McCarthyist, it's because it is McCarthyist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I let the government in on a secret? There are Liberal Party supporters and National Party supporters, and, I dare say it, a few Labor Party supporters, who are members of the ADF, who work in the Public Service, who are AFP personnel, who contribute to our national life. They aren't a fifth column; rather, they are Australians enjoying their right to participate without fear or favour. This is so different from the American path. That path believes that all who disagree with you should be excluded from public life. It's a bad path to walk along, because it corrodes the shared approach to our civic life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, this bill, the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023, isn't about justice or about making our system better. It's about purging and then stacking—stacking from the start. This bill is not about removing politics from the AAT; it's about the full-scale left-wing politicisation of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a purge that will inevitably result in unintended second- and third-order consequences. We saw this from the very moment that the Attorney announced the abolition and replacement of the AAT. On 16 December 2022, the Attorney-General issued a media release entitled 'Albanese government to abolish Administrative Appeals Tribunal'. I'll read you the Attorney's central argument in the release:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By appointing as many as 85 former Liberal MPs, failed Liberal candidates, former Liberal staffers and other close Liberal associates without any merit-based selection process—including some individuals with no relevant experience or expertise—the former government fatally compromised the AAT, undermined its independence and eroded the quality and efficiency of its decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's interesting that the department was so concerned about this media release that it does not appear on the department's website. The department would not put it up on its website. It appears on the Attorney-General's personal website. Could this be on the basis that the release lacks truthfulness or the aspersions placed on people's character or potential legal doubts it created around the decisions and processes of the AAT? I pay tribute to the Attorney-General's Department for standing up to the Attorney on this. They also knew that, as it pertained to law, the AAT was working to the highest standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AAT has been a uniquely Australian institution. It's an institution that has allowed Australians to seek reviews of decisions made by the federal government. Importantly, many Australians do so without costly legal representation. It allows them to challenge decisions of government that directly affect them. In 2022-23, an average of 788 applications for review were lodged every week. This was down from 850 applications a week in 2021-22, a decrease of around seven per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the decisions are complex and deeply personal. There's nothing easy regarding decisions about migration, citizenship, child support, social security, the NDIS, taxation, veterans and workers compensation. The decisions that are made directly determine the course of people's lives. In 2022-23, 20,600 migration and refugee cases were finalised, as well as 11,100 social services and child support decisions and 5,600 NDIS decisions. Nobody should be under any illusion that these are difficult decisions. Yet benchmarking of user feedback indicates strong support for the responsiveness of the level of service given.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last year prior to the Attorney's announcement, which was 2021-22, the user satisfaction survey rate was 74 per cent, above the AAT's own target of 70 per cent. Keep in mind there were many cases where participants were dissatisfied with the final result, yet satisfaction rates of how they were dealt with by the tribunal were still high. It outperformed its target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well, the decisions, because they can be subject to appeal, must be robust. The AAT takes incredible pressure off our courts. The best test of the quality of the decisions is not the Attorney-General's rhetoric; it's the rate of successful appeals. The AAT sets itself a benchmark with fewer than five per cent of successful appeals on appellable decisions. In 2021-22 the result was 1.9 per cent. That's well under target. It's worth noting that after the Attorney-General's great leap forward was announced, satisfaction rates fell to 72 per cent in 2022-23, and the successful appeal rate rose to 2.1 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also of concern is the decline in the rate of publication of key decisions since the Attorney's announcement. Publication is a means of providing confidence in decision-making. In 2021 the number of published decisions exceeded 5,400. By 2022-23 it had fallen to a smidgen over 5,000. It's also worth recording that at the end of 2021-22 the number of cases on hand was 56,100. The Attorney was quite damning about this backlog. Yet, even with the seven per cent fall in new cases, the backlog has now grown to 66,100—an increase of 18 per cent. This is a direct result of the Attorney playing games with a system that was working well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I warned a year ago, when I was shadow Attorney, that the AAT could potentially go backwards. It has, and the staff know it too. In the 2023 APS Employee Census staff were asked the question: am I proud to work in my agency? The results for the AAT, by its own admission, were 12 points lower than for any other medium-sized federal government agency. Fifty-one per cent said yes when asked: does my agency really inspire me to do my best every day? Again, this was 10 points lower than for the medium-sized agencies. The decline in staff morale is directly linked to the Attorney's planned purge. It's hard for staff to feel proud when the Attorney disparages the people they work with, and the people that have been working well. By the relevant measures, the AAT has been performing well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I will concede is that, given the backlog, it needed more appointees. In this regard the government could simply have made additional appointments. Instead, this change was not about performance; it was about politics. That's why the government said there would be no changes to AAT staff—only to its members. The Attorney-General's media release announcing his purge claimed that as many as 85 people serving on the tribunal had associations with the coalition. It's worth unpacking that claim. It's a claim that's as dubious as the PM saying, 'My word is my bond,' or a Labor promise to cut your power bills and keep interest rates low. Yet this dubious claim was taken from Crikey and the left-wing Australia Institute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people who were on the Dreyfus/Crikey/Australia Institute hit list include people who've done nothing more than be a volunteer member of the Liberal or National parties. It is a hit list. It simply judges people on the link to a party rather than on the quality of work they've done. The danger of this approach is the idea that it seeds—that political involvement, support or engagement should be seen as a disqualifier for any form of service to this country. Instead we're seeing something much more sinister: a check on one government being removed that seeks to replace any person with a link to a former government. In other words, they want either a rubber stamp or a blank cheque, rather than a considered response to tens of thousands of issues raised at the tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth recalling who the Attorney targeted in his hit list. He targeted people who meet the statutory qualifications for appointment to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal—namely, they're either enrolled as legal practitioners for at least five years or have special knowledge or skills relevant to their duties. It's worth recording who the Attorney thinks is unqualified. The Attorney's purge includes peoples with master's degrees from Ivy League and Oxford universities, people with doctorates in law, people with first-class honours degrees and at least two university medallists. The purge also includes senior decorated military officers—people who have put their lives on the line for this country. It includes senior public servants, academics, barristers, partners in law firms and police officers with decades of experience. It includes people who have served on tribunals at the state and territory level. It includes public servants who headed departments and agencies, including public servants who have been awarded the Public Service Medal. It also includes people with life experience that includes being a former deputy registrar of the state supreme court, a former sex discrimination commissioner, the Chair of the Accounting Standards Board and the editor of the legal service on practice and procedure for one of the state tribunals. As you can see, these are people who are highly qualified to serve on this tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe serving in this House or in the Senate, or in a state or territory parliament, or joining a political party should be seen as a commitment to Australia and to public service. It's not a black mark that should disqualify people from continuing their service either on a tribunal or in other places across government. By making political affiliation a black mark, we send a message about this place and the people in it. It makes parliamentary service something of a disparagement, rather than the deep responsibility that it is. Ultimately, it diminishes the political process, which is to the detriment of our whole country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney likes to argue that he is pursuing an independent selection process, but let's look at section 209 of the bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(1) The Minister may, from time to time, establish one or more panels (assessment panels) of persons to assess a candidate or candidates for appointment as a member.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The regulations may make provision for and in relation to assessment panels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(3) Without limiting subsection (2), the regulations may make provision for and in relation to the following:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) the establishment of assessment panels;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) the composition of assessment panels;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(c) the operation and procedures of assessment panels;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(d) the methodology to be used by assessment panels in assessing candidates for appointment as a member;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(e) the provision of assistance by the Department to assessment panels, including secretariat services and clerical assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, everything to do with the assessment panels remains in the minister's hands. This is a process where the Attorney will establish the panels, their composition, their operations, their procedures and their methodologies. In other words, these so-called assessment panels are a bit like a scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</span>, with a committee of Oompa-Loompas all bearing the face of the Attorney. All the Oompa-Loompas will be aware of what happens if you don't keep in line: they will get a 'please explain' phone call from the Attorney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all recall the 'please explain' phone call made to the former tribunal president Justice Fiona Meagher. On 12 November 2022, Justice Meagher put out a statement detailing the progress the tribunal had been making since her appointment just eight months before. Then there was a mysterious call from the Attorney which the <span style="font-style:italic;">AFR</span> called a 'please explain' call. Within weeks, Justice Meagher was gone from the AAT, silently moved to full-time duties at the Federal Court. All references to her were scrubbed from the AAT website. It's chilling. She was simply disappeared. This is not the sort of activity you expect to see in an Australian administrative law institution—not in a democracy such as ours. Again, we see the mistreatment of a respected figure, removed for not toeing the line. We don't know the exact words spoken or the exact tone of the call, but we do know the result of it. And what we do know is that the Attorney's actions were unbecoming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has dealt with hundreds of thousands of cases. It has done so free of scandal or malfeasance. It has done so in the best traditions of justice and fairness under the Australian legal system. The Attorney has decided to play politics with a core aspect of the Australian administrative law system—something I think is world-beating; something we can be proud of, from the origins of the idea of the AAT back in the days of the Kerr committee. That was a committee headed by former Chief Justice of New South Wales and later Governor-General of Australia Sir John Kerr, a committee that also had on it people like Sir Anthony Mason and the late Bob Ellicott—a really terrific group of Australians who helped design the administrative law system, which is unique to Australia and has been investigated and copied in several other places.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney's decision to play politics with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is deeply regrettable. History shows that, when you do that, it plays itself out in unintended second- and third-order consequences. That will ultimately be to the detriment of justice and, importantly, to Australians who have relied on this unique and important Australian institution.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  This is a comprehensive reform package of bills which establishes a new federal administrative review body. The Albanese Labor government committed to cleaning up what was frankly, despite the previous speaker's attestations to the AAT's operations, a mess left by the previous Liberal government. We have set about, in this package of reforms, modernising and streamlining our administrative review processes. This broad legislative initiative underscores the Labor government's commitment to ensuring fairness, transparency and accountability in governmental decision-making. By establishing the Administrative Review Tribunal and enacting consequential provisions, we pave the way for a more responsive and accessible administrative justice system, benefiting citizens and government alike.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023, the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 1) Bill 2023 and the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 2) Bill 2024 complete this package that implements the government's commitment to establish the new ART. It replaces the current AAT, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We've heard a few comments about the operations of the AAT in the past. I've got to say: not only is this government about trying to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the administrative review processes that have been conducted; it is also about cleaning up what was, frankly, not working. In a sense, these bills importantly serve a crucial role in our legislative framework by repealing the outdated Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 and facilitating a seamless transition of operations, caseload and staff to the newly established tribunal. The bills implement, among other things, a better and improved standardised hearing mechanism, institute a guidance and appeals panel within the tribunal, foster a more flexible structure and, importantly, clarify and make transparent the procedures around appointing tribunal members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason for such sweeping reform is simply the incompetence, mismanagement and negligence of the previous Liberal government, which requires a Labor government to clean up the mess. The system of administrative review has been beset—these are the facts—with issues because of the failure of the previous government. Let's go into those failures that need cleaning up: the lack of a fair and transparent process for appointing skilled members; a growing number of cases waiting for resolution, aggravated by insufficient funding and cuts to resources; challenges with coordination and teamwork due to the ongoing merger of tribunals; inefficiencies caused by outdated and failing computer systems nearing the end of their useful life; and a culture, frankly, of jobs for the boys and girls, with handpicked appointments by the Liberals as favours for their mates when these mates were thoroughly unqualified to sit on the tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of these failures, I think the most egregious failure of the previous government lies in the politicisation of these AAT appointments. The former government's penchant for political appointments, including of individuals who had no relevant expertise to be a member of the tribunal, has undermined the credibility of the AAT and raised serious questions about the integrity of its decisions. When those opposite were in government, they appointed as many as 85 former Liberal MPs, failed Liberal candidates, former Liberal staffers and other close Liberal associates without any merit based selection process—including some individuals with no relevant experience or expertise at all—fatally compromising the system. They should be ashamed of themselves, and ashamed of bringing the country's Administrative Appeals Tribunal into such disrepute. This failure and mismanagement—</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  The member for Riverina might not want me to be heard, and those opposite might not want to hear it, but, through failure after failure, they have mismanaged the AAT. People have had such adverse impacts that they've waited years for decisions, because they were incorrectly determined and they were undercooked decisions, and they've had lengthy and expensive judicial processes because of the mismanagement of those opposite. That is what they don't want to hear about, but we'll keep saying it because it's true.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a human impact of what they have done in their mismanagement, and that is the thousands of people affected. I know this, and I'm sure others know this as well, because the hardworking staff in our electorate offices are the ones who have to help those people who've gone through lengthy and nightmarish bureaucratic processes. Tens of thousands of people who relied on the AAT to independently review government decisions have had life-altering impacts because of their mismanagement. We're cleaning up this mess and cleaning up the legacy of mismanagement by the coalition. We're cleaning up the legacy of irresponsibility and the legacy of deep suffering for migrants and refugees, particularly, who sought to call Australia home. That's why it's incumbent upon us to actually deliver these reforms, and that's why we're going to pass them through the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  No doubt we'll get a nice interjection from the member for Riverina as they play this childish game of not wanting to hear about the problems they created with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes in the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill are in line with the Albanese Labor government's commitment to transparency for all levels of government. But let's take a moment to consider why these changes are necessary and what has led us here today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As members on this side of the chamber know, the former Liberal-National government's track record on integrity was appalling at best. The coalition dragged their feet and did not implement a national anticorruption commission. Despite promising to take it to an election, they didn't do it. Despite winning an election, they never did it. The coalition were actively facilitating sports rorts, car park rorts and any other rort you can think of. The coalition wrote the book on prolific pork-barrelling, and communities across Australia suffered. Our community knows that the suburbs and towns across McEwen suffered because of the selfishness of the Liberal-National government. But now we've got a government in charge that is run by adults, and the establishment of the Administrative Review Tribunal is one of the many steps the Labor government is taking to restore the public's faith in government and its processes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was back in late 2022 that the Albanese government announced the decision to abolish the 'Jobs for Mates' scheme, or the old Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and replace it with a transparent new federal review body. This reform was needed after the coalition decimated the integrity of the AAT. The original body was no longer viable when we took government in 2022. The sad reality was that things were too far gone to fix what those opposite had done to the AAT. Eighty-five former Liberal and National MPs, failed candidates, former staffers and close Liberal-National associates had been appointed without a merit based process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Berowra tried to say: 'Look at the ADF. It doesn't matter what side of politics you like, you can join the ADF.' He's trying to equate AAT pork-barrelling to the ADF. But the bit the member for Berowra didn't mention is that to become a member of the ADF you have to have merit, you have to meet criteria and have qualifications, and you have to earn your place. You don't have to pay the membership fee in a Liberal Party branch or a National Party branch to get there. That's what happened. During the time of the AAT they appointed individuals with no relevant experience or expertise. The former government fatally compromised the AAT, undermined its independence, and we saw what happened. In addition to fielding accusations that they had stacked the AAT with former politicians, staffers, party supporters and donors, they ended up putting the nail in the coffin of the AAT by rushing through several non-urgent term extensions instead of leaving them to the incoming government, which is usually the case. Plum jobs worth up to $500,000 a year were extended to coalition-linked individuals to prevent the new government from overhauling what was left of the body.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To make sure we truly understand what happened, let's look at the examples. Former Liberal senator Karen Synon was first appointed to the tribunal in 2015. Her term was not due to expire until December 2023, 20 months after we got into government. However, in 2022, before Prime Minister Scott Morrison set the election date for 21 May, triggering the Commonwealth caretaker provisions, the Attorney-General, Michaelia Cash, extended this member's term until May 2027. She was a deputy president of the AAT on a salary of $500,00 because of liberal mates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have look at serial failed Liberal candidate Donna Petrovich, a name synonymous to those in our region for failure, whose term as a full-time member was extended to May 2027, again without merit or any form of consideration. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed) </span>Of course, they don't like hearing about this, because it hurts them. It hurts them when we think about those like, as I said, Donna Petrovich, the failed Liberal candidate who had her term extended to May 2027 without merit, or Donald Morris, who worked for the Liberal Party his entire professional life and who was granted an extension as a full-time senior member on a salary of $390,000 until May 2027. Then of course there was Andrew Nikolic, the failed member who came from Tasmania. He was another one appointed without merit, without justification. It was a job for a mate because he couldn't hold his seat. It is about the power of the government of the day to appoint members to the tribunal to extend contracts. These contract extensions were secured only for their coalition mates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, not everyone on the AAT is a coalition mate, and under that government we saw a deliberate stifling of the AAT process to stall it and to lock it up because it didn't suit the agenda of the government of the day. When the then government did something wrong, which was quite often—quite regularly they did something that failed the probity test, failed the honesty test, failed the pub test or whatever you look at—they would get their Liberal mates to stall things happening there. It impacted the lives of ordinary Australians who had gone to the AAT in good faith to have their case heard. Because of what happened under the former Liberal and National coalition government, they were held up for months and even years. For years we had a backlog.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What else would you expect from a government that was notorious for pork-barrelling, stifling debate and the anticorruption commission? What else would you expect from a Prime Minister who had five secret ministries? None of this passes the pub test. When asked about the situation, the barrister and director of the Centre for Public Integrity, Geoffrey Watson SC, said there was no clear explanation for why the extensions had been put through—none at all. He said he wished he could be surprised. But he's not surprised, because that's what you get under a coalition government—those are my words, that last bit. He said it's just evidence of a deeper and more extensive manipulation of the membership of the AAT. Our Attorney-General has detailed it as a disgraceful exhibition of cronyism by the Liberal Party. Australians expect honesty, accountability and integrity from government. People's futures, as I said, were put on hold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, this is another mess that the Albanese government has inherited—an AAT that is not on a sustainable financial footing. It's a system that is defined by deliberate unnecessary delays and an extraordinarily large backlog of applications. It's a legacy of the former government's mismanagement of public institutions. This mismanagement came at the cost of tens of thousands of people who rely on the AAT to have government decisions independently reviewed, especially when these decisions can have a life-altering impact. Whether it be older Australians receiving an age pension or a veteran being compensated for a service injury, you'd think that would be something that you'd have a lot of support for. But under the AAT it didn't. Veterans were held up, unnecessarily and deliberately, because it didn't suit the government of the day's agenda. You'd think an NDIS participant receiving funding for essential support would be non-partisan. But that was the story we had with the former government. It was all partisan politics, nothing about people and nothing about policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve a body they can trust, one that upholds the values of integrity and accountability and that is acting in the best interests of Australians, not just providing jobs for political allies. This is why we are abolishing the irreversibly damaged AAT and implementing the new Administrative Review Tribunal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look in some more detail at the proposed new body. This is a system of administrative review, beginning with the establishment of a new administrative review body that is user focused, efficient, accessible, independent and fair. One of the key differences between the previous system and the one before the House is that the new Administrative Review Tribunal will have a transparent and merit based selection process for non-judicial members. This is a huge difference. As I said when the member for Berowra tried to make his false equivalence between that and the members of the ADF, that was the little bit he missed out. He missed that ADF members have to have merit based entry and so do non-judicial members of the ART. This is in stark contrast to the former government and their approach. It builds on the 50 years of experience learning in broad consultation to establish a tribunal that is user focused. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By implementing all three recommendations from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee review into the performance and integrity of Australia's administrative review system, this bill strengthens the system. It also implements four recommendations from the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme—we all know about that and the many problems it caused for Australians—and the government's response to the commission, as well as the two recommendations from the Rapid Review into the Exploitation of Australia's Visa System. This is about creating a new tribunal that will stand the test of time and governments, whatever political persuasion, by creating a body that won't be swayed by the political whims of the day but, rather, focuses on what is the best outcome for Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the tribunal's objective will be to provide an independent mechanism of review that is fair and just, resolves applications in a timely manner with as little formality and expense as is consistent with reaching the correct or preferable decision, is accessible and responsive to the diverse needs of parties, improves transparency and the quality of decision-making, and promotes public trust and confidence in the tribunal. To do this, the tribunal incorporates key features to improve merits review, including simpler and more consistent processes, a suite of powers and procedures to respond flexibly to changing caseloads, and a simple membership structure with clear qualifications for members. These are some of the many ways that the ART is miles ahead of what we had with the AAT. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make it clear the government has been explicit in saying that the cases that are being considered when the AAT is abolished will be transitioned into the new body automatically. The new Administrative Review Tribunal will provide Australians with stronger processes to fight against government decisions that have a major impact on them. The Albanese Labor government are committed to creating fairer and more transparent and accountable government processes. We are fulfilling our election commitments—something which it would be unusual for those opposite to know about—and restoring the public's trust that got smashed to pieces under the former coalition government. This bill should have a speedy passage. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  We tried to give the member for McEwen the opportunity, through calling for a quorum, to do a bit of homework and research on his talking points for his speech on the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023, because there is a statistic that he failed to mention right throughout. It may surprise people, but almost half of the members who currently comprise the AAT were appointed under the current government. Almost half were appointed by the current government. It may surprise people as well that all of those 160 will remain after the AAT is abolished. So let's just put this in perspective: all those who you've appointed will stay there, and all those who've been previously appointed will need to reapply. Is that fair? Do you think that's proper process? Do you think that's how you should do reform? 'We will look after everyone who we have appointed, but, as for all those who have been appointed previously, we will make them go through a merits based qualification process.' Why don't you put the 160 that you appointed through the merits based process? Why doesn't the Attorney-General put those 160 through that? You talk about reform, but it's always reform which suits your interests and not the broader interests of the Australian people. That is what we see with this reform for the AAT here, as presented by the Attorney-General.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not saying that the AAT shouldn't be reformed. You should always look at how bodies like the AAT are performing and see whether there are new measures that you can put in place to make sure that they can continue to do the job that the Australian people want them to do. But reform the Labor way—as we have seen right across the board throughout the nearly two years that this government has been in place—is not reform in the interests of the Australian people. It's reform in Labor's base political interests, and that's all we see in everything that we touch on when it comes to this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say there are key things that we always fail to see. When it comes to transparency, do we get transparency from this government with how it goes about its decision-making? No, we do not—right across the board. There is never proper transparency, and I will give you one example which is relevant to the AAT because the AAT has a migration function. Do you think the minister for immigration will come into this place and tell the Australian people how many more hardened criminals potentially might have to be released from detention if the High Court makes a decision which goes against the government in the coming weeks? It might be that the High Court will find in favour or consistent with what the government is saying, but the point is: where is the transparency around that number, which we know is between 100 and 150? Of course, we don't see anything like that from the government, because it's transparency when it suits them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the AAT, it's very, very interesting to look at the performance measures in relation to transparency. In the financial year to 30 June 2022, the AAT exceeded its performance benchmark of 5,000 decisions published. It continued to exceed those benchmarks in the 2022-23 financial year. So there is transparency here, yet, when it comes to how the government is trying to undertake its reform process, there isn't proper transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about with regard to decision-making quality? We know that with the Attorney-General and the way that he has approached this issue the decision-making quality has been lacking from go to whoa. It's a great shame, because this could have been done in a thorough manner. It could have been done in consultation with the parliament. It's the type of process, when it comes to a body like the AAT, where you could get reasonable bipartisanship, but that's not what the government has sought to do, because, sadly, the Attorney-General's decision-making quality is seriously lacking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where is it at with regard to the AAT? In relation to decision-making quality, in 2021-22, the proportion of appeals allowed by the courts was below the benchmark of five per cent. The AAT continued to meet that threshold in the 2022-23 financial year. Once again, when it comes to decision-making quality, we see the Attorney-General and the government failing, but we see that the AAT is actually meeting the benchmarks that have been set for it by both sides of politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the clearance ratio, I'm trying to think of an analogy for the government with regard to clearance ratios, but it's hard to come at one. Maybe I will be able to think of something as I go through the clearance ratio performance of the AAT in 2021-22. It fell just short of its target, due primarily to the sudden jump in post-COVID lodgements. Having been at a 119 per cent clearance ratio the year before, in 2021-22 it dropped to 95 per cent in the face of a sudden surge in lodgements. The number of lodgements dropped off significantly in 2022-23, and the AAT is back to the position of finalising more cases than lodged. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we go to the final point, which is in regard to sheer output. We know that the government is lacking when it comes to sheer output. We have got most ministers completely and utterly underperforming. But how is the AAT going when it goes to sheer output? In the number of AAT applications and referrals finalised in 2021-22, the AAT reached 90 per cent of its target. It's not 100 per cent, but they reached 90 per cent of their target. There were factors that were outside the AAT's control. For instance, there were continued disruptions associated with COVID-19. Obviously we all know that that meant it was harder for the AAT to be able to do its job. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say all this in stating once again that the AAT is not a perfect body and the AAT does need to improve its performance, especially when it comes to the timeliness of decision-making. This is something that we do want to see improve. There are very good reasons as to why we want to see this improve. One of the reasons why timeliness has been a factor is to do with the complex legacy migration cases from many thousands of unlawful arrivals under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor years. That has made the case load very complex for the AAT and components of the AAT, in particular the Migration Review Tribunal. It has meant some of the timeliness is seriously in need of fixing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you an example of this. We had nearly 23,000 arrivals last year, under the Labor government, of people who are coming here by plane and then claiming asylum. It can take up to 10 years for those claims to be heard and finalised. Obviously, while something is taking that long, that acts as a way and a means for people smugglers to be able to say to people, 'If you get to Australia through legal means and then you seek asylum, you will be able to stay in Australia and enjoy the Australian way of life for up to 10 years.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We seriously need to deal with this issue, especially now, when we have some legal and migration agents actually advertising—including on Facebook—to people to come here and seek asylum as a way of staying in Australia for over 10 years. So the timeliness issue is definitely something that we need to look at. It's not just the timeliness of the process leading to perverse incentives, as we are seeing from those who are coming legally by plane then seeking to claim asylum. It's the extra costs right throughout the system that this leads to as well—those extra welfare payments and the extra costs of appeal after appeal after appeal. Sometimes there are appeals through the Migration Review Tribunal, the AAT and the Federal Court—right through the system. That adds to the cost to the taxpayer right across the board. There are a number of things that the government should do to seek to fix this. Reform of the AAT is one such thing, but some clear policy work to also address this issue is desperately needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that I'm hoping is that the immigration minister will find time to look at this, because I'm not quite sure what he's been doing—well, I am quite sure what he has been doing over the last year and a half. He got very distracted, first of all, by trying to fundraise for Dan Andrews and then got very focused on promoting the Voice. Then he went overseas to the UK Labour conference, and then he was promoting and making sure that people were out voting for the Voice when he was in the UK. Meanwhile, he didn't turn up to three key legal briefings that his department offered. So there are many things that he has been doing that very clearly show that he hasn't had his priorities right. Hopefully that will change, and one of the things he will be able to do is focus on this issue, where we do need to get these timeliness issues fixed when it comes to the Migration Review Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to work cooperatively and seriously with the government to make sure that there is proper reform of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, but it has to be done in a way where there can be meaningful discussions and meaningful consultation and where the opposition is properly and thoroughly engaged with. I'm not holding out great hope that that's what will happen. Unfortunately, the Attorney-General has a track record which isn't one of being bipartisan. It's one of being more partisan than not. As a matter fact, I think it would be fair to say that, when it comes to this place, the Attorney-General is one of those characters that just seems to love the partisanship rather than the bipartisanship. But I might be wrong, and the Attorney-General might surprise me. If he did, I think we would go a long way to making sure we were getting the type of reform to the AAT that is required. So I say to the Attorney-General: please reach out to the shadow Attorney-General and make sure that you engage properly so that we can make sure that we get all the proper reforms that we need and we can make sure we get good balance in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the start, what we've seen so far is that the government is hell-bent on looking after all those people that it appointed and then wants to bring change for all those people who they didn't appoint. Some of those people have incredibly impeccable credentials when it comes to sitting on the AAT. So let's make sure that we do this properly. Let's drive through the type of reform that the AAT needs, and let's in particular make sure that we address that issue of timeliness, because it's in all of our interest. It's in the government's interest and it's in the parliament's interest that that issue of timeliness is dealt with. As I've said—and I've given one clear example of this—if that timeliness issue isn't fixed when it comes to those people who are coming to Australia by legal means on student visas, on tourist visas or on any other types of visas and then claiming asylum, we are going to be left with another mess of this government's making.</span>

                    <a href="296272" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  I rise to speak on the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023. In late 2022, the Albanese government announced its decision to abolish the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the AAT, and replace it with a new federal administrative review body. This is a significant reform. The AAT, soon to be the ART, is an important part of the relationship between the Australian people and their government. It's an important part of transparency and justice. It's an important part of Australians being able to seek justice or, at the very least, a review of decisions made about their lives, their rights and their entitlements. These are decisions made by large government bureaucracies and public servants. They are seeking reviews of decisions made by the NDIA, Services Australia, the Department of Social Services and immigration. These are decisions made where there is a significant imbalance of power between the applicant, an individual; and the decision-maker, often an anonymous public servant in the giant bureaucracy with a lot of power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the former government took this valuable review process away from Australians. They undermined it. They undermined its integrity. They undermined the faith the Australian people had in the institution. Frankly, given what we now know, with the repeated decisions against the government that were exposed in the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme, it isn't surprising that they didn't want an unbiased umpire to be able to review their actions. So they undermined the AAT by appointing as many as 85 former Liberal MPs, failed Liberal candidates, former Liberal staffers and other close Liberal associates without any merit based selection process. Some of these individuals had no relevant expertise or experience. The former Liberal-National government fatally compromised the AAT, undermined its independence and eroded the quality and efficiency of its decision-making. In doing so, they took away the rights of Australian individuals to seek an unbiased review of decisions made about them and their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government inherited an AAT that is not on a substantial financial footing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>It<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>is beset by delays, as we just heard from the member for Wannon. Sometimes there were delays of years to get into the AAT to get a decision reviewed, because the AAT had an extraordinarily large and growing backlog of applications. It was not helped by operating on multiple ageing electronic case-management systems. People were forced to live with incorrect, unfair decisions or were in doubt about what the decision would be for years while waiting to get into the AAT. They were forced to live with the unfairness, the trauma and the poor outcomes, to keep their grievance alive for when they eventually got their call to come in. As the member for Wannon talked about previously, under their regime those seeking asylum would be waiting up to 10 years for cases to be resolved. He mentioned how this encouraged bad actors, bad migration agents, to promote this as a way for people to get into the country and try and claim asylum, even though they had no right to it. This was under their regime. This is what those delays actually meant. People came into the country knowing it would take 10 years to resolve their asylum claim—so that was their way in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the legacy of the former government's mismanagement of the amalgamation of the AAT with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. This comes at a very real cost to the tens of thousands of people who rely on the AAT each year to independently review government decisions that have major and sometimes life-altering impacts on their lives. These include decisions such as whether an older Australian receives an age pension, whether a veteran is compensated for a service injury or whether a participant of the NDIS receives funding for essential supports. These are the stories I heard when I campaigned in the 2022 election. These are important decisions for individuals, and it should be important to the government that they are made correctly as well. For the previous government, it obviously wasn't. But the Albanese Labor government was elected on an integrity platform, and this is part of integrity—integrity in our dealings with Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, on request from the Attorney-General, conducted an inquiry into the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023 and the associated legislation. The committee scrutinised the bills, including through public consultation and hearings, to ensure they achieved the government's policy objectives and would not have unintended consequences. I'd like to thank particularly those who put in submissions for the consultation and those who attended the hearings. Their quality, experience and expertise was invaluable to the committee's consideration. The bills are intended, amongst other things, to provide for a mechanism of review that is fair, just, timely, informal, inexpensive, accessible and responsive, that improves transparency and quality of government decision-making, and that improves public trust and confidence in the tribunal. Australians should expect no less of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills re-establish the Administrative Review Council, retain the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and make essential modifications to the operations of the merits review framework. They promote consistency and simplicity by repealing special arrangements that overlap, duplicate or unnecessarily displace core provisions of the ART bill. The bills will implement all three recommendations of the Senate Standing Committees on Legal and Constitutional Affairs' inquiry into the performance and integrity of Australia's administrative review system. There are four recommendations of the royal commission into the robodebt scheme and two recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Rapid </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eview into the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">xploitation of Australia's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">v</span><span style="font-style:italic;">isa </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ystem</span>. It is clear that the AAT has lost the confidence of the Australian public and there is broad support for establishing a new administrative review regime with the bills' stated objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed reforms create a new tribunal—the Administrative Review Tribunal. It will be a self-correcting system with several backstops to ensure that government and ART decisions are made correctly and transparently, that defective decision-making by government can be held to account and that systemic issues will be escalated and responded to effectively. These features include the Administrative Review Tribunal, which will be independent of government and will monitor and support the integrity of the administrative review system. The new Tribunal Advisory Committee and the guidance and appeals panel will review the operation of the ART, respond to emergency issues and help ensure correct and consistent decisions are made. The new code of conduct and performance standard requirements, stronger reporting obligations and a requirement for professional development for members and staff further support the bill's objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Several submitters suggested the ART bill should require the use of a selection panel in the appointments process for ART members. While that's not strictly necessary, because the government has indicated that such matters can and will be provided for by legally-binding regulations, the committee encouraged the government to give further consideration to adopting that suggestion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provision of legal aid, particularly to vulnerable applicants, will be important to the ART's success in meeting its policy objectives. The committee is aware that legal services to assist applicants to the AAT may have limited capacity to support any further demand generated by the transition from the AAT to the ART. The committee strongly supported the government acting on the findings of the upcoming review of the National Legal Assistance Partnership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While noting the proposed new administrative arrangements for migration and protection matters do not go as far as many would like, the committee was of the view that the consequential bill meets the intended policy objectives of streamlining the administrative reviews process while maintaining the current principles of administrative review. Together with the other measures announced by the government, the arrangements in the bill will help address the crippling delays in the Migration and Refugee Division of the AAT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommended that both bills pass the House and encouraged the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee to give further consideration to matters raised by submitters and then report on this as part of its inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, the transition from the old AAT to the new ART is of concern to those who currently have matters under consideration or in the queue. The government has made it clear that AAT cases that are on foot when the AAT is abolished will be transitioned to the new body automatically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is committed to restoring trust and confidence in Australia's system of administrative review, beginning with the establishment of a new administrative review body that it is user focused, efficient, accessible, independent and fair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government was elected on a platform of integrity. It was just one of the points of difference between us and the previous government at the 2022 election. The implementation of a national anticorruption commission was a major platform, but only one part of a completely new way of working for the Australian people with the Australian people, different to the ways of the previous government, which formed the basis of so many complaints from my constituents in Boothby. Cleaning up the AAT is another part of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A central part of the new body will be a transparent and merit based selection process for the appointment of non-judicial members. This is in stark contrast to the former government, who appointed as many as 85 former Liberal MPs, failed Liberal candidates, former Liberal staffers and other close Liberal associates without any merit based process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tribunal's objective will be to provide an independent mechanism of review that is fair and just, and that resolves applications in a timely matter, with as little formality and expense as is consistent with reaching the correct or preferable decision. It is accessible and responsive to the diverse needs of parties, improves the transparency and quality of decision-making, and promotes public trust and confidence in the tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2022 election campaign I heard so many complaints and horror stories from the people in Boothby about their experiences with the AAT. I don't want to hear those stories again. I want Australians to get a fair go, to be treated fairly under their government. Under those opposite—robodebt, mishandling of NDIS and the immigration delays I mentioned earlier leading to scams—it was not good enough. Never again. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  It is critical that the Australian public can trust that our democratic institutions are working properly. They need to be sure that these institutions are independent, impartial and free from politics. If you have an administrative decision that you feel has been wrongly decided and needs to be challenged then the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was the place of recourse. If that system is not working fairly, we have a situation where you cannot challenge those decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new review body proposed under the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023 will, under the provisions of this legislation, be more transparent, more accountable and, more importantly, have an appointment process that cannot be overtly tainted by political appointments. Whether it's your visa application being denied, your NDIS application being rejected or being subject to an unfair or adverse small-business taxation decision, these are the types of matters this tribunal deals with. So this matters to everyone. Decisions on child support, citizenship, social security, freedom of information, immigration, security assessments, veterans' affairs, workers compensation—the list is long on why an appeals tribunal is incredibly important. Decisions on these issues will affect people's lives and livelihoods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AAT, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, was meant to be the body empowered to review the merits of those types of decisions. However, for too long it failed to do the job properly. There remain 66,131 cases before the AAT awaiting finalisation. Most of these cases, some 83 per cent, were in the migration and refugee division. This has led to untold harm and distress to many, many people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This long-awaited bill is an opportunity to fix the serious problems with the AAT. This set of bills will abolish the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and replace it with the new, much improved Administrative Review Tribunal. Australians must feel that they will get a fair hearing by an administrative review body that can make key decisions affecting people's lives. So many communities, including mine of Warringah, are crying out for reforms to integrity in public life and administrative bodies. The most high-profile case or issue of late that has been dealt with by the Administrative Review Tribunal was in fact robodebt. It's incredibly sad to think that, whilst the AAT made an adverse finding in relation to robodebt being unlawful back in 2017, that was never published. So it took another two years of more victims and more trauma and distress before the Federal Court was able to highlight and get a successful challenge to robodebt.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say it's disappointing to hear the coalition's debate and argument on this bill, in that they still fail to acknowledge responsibility for such a failed program. Really, you can't come to this debate discussing the question of an administrative appeals body that will work without acknowledging the errors and the problems that we've had in the past and also acknowledging where government gets it wrong. Where government gets it wrong or where departments and administrative decisions get it wrong, you need to acknowledge the importance of there being a process of clear review; a clear process of appeal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question of who the decision-makers are under a body becomes incredibly important. There is clear evidence that for too long it has been overtly politicised. Research by the Australia Institute shows that, under the previous nine years of the coalition government, political appointments averaged 32 per cent. What was concerning was that, in a number of instances, we had the appointment of people who did not even have legal training or expertise. They were completely unsuited to sit or determine the administrative review process. We know that under previous governments—in the Howard era and even the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era—a percentage of political appointees were there as well, but not to the same extent. It was identified by the previous government as being a system that could, essentially, be abused to get political outcomes and really tarnish this process. There was a blatant jobs for mates process in the scheme, and it was directly affecting the ability of the AAT to function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018 Mike Seccombe from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Paper</span> did an investigative piece that showed how far the rot had spread. In the 2017-18 annual report on the AAT, something that would usually make for quite ordinary reading, he noted that in 2017-18 the number of cases lodged in the tribunal's reporting period increased dramatically, while the number of cases dealt with fell. So the numbers reported at the time were staggering, yet the government of the day did nothing about it. It looked the other way, when it was its responsibility to ensure that there is an administrative review process that is robust and working. The annual report noted that the AAT faced an enormous backlog of appeals dating back some four years and that the total number of applications in front of them had grown to over 53,000 cases as at 30 June 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking to the<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Paper</span> in 2018, the former AAT members said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There was really big spill of old experienced members and the introduction of people who, in some cases, were not interviewed at all by the panel set up to consider appointments. There was a process of appointments of people for which it was jobs for mates but not suitability for the job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ruin of the AAT was done very much by that appointment process. It purged experienced people and expertise within the tribunal, totally abandoned any pretence of merit based appointments and stacked the tribunal with political mates. Some of those political appointments—including party members, donors, failed candidates and retired politicians—although not all, at times lacked, incredibly, relevant experience to even do the job they were appointed to do. The legacy of mismanagement continues today, unfortunately. The most recent annual report from the AAT shows that they finalised 61 per cent of applications within 12 months, which is below the performance measure target of 75 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do acknowledge that the government has put more resourcing into tackling the backlog, but the mismanagement under the previous government will take some further time to clean up. The government is doing the right thing, and I very much support the abolishing of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The previous government did its level best to essentially destroy the AAT and the functioning review body from within and for its purpose. It's incredibly important for the Australian public to understand the essential role such a body plays for all of you. At some point in time you may need to have an administrative appeal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023 establishes the Administrative Review Tribunal and abolishes the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. When introducing the bill last year, the Attorney-General noted that the aims of the new Administrative Review Tribunal are that it will be, in essence, an independent body of review for federal decisions that is fair, just, timely and accessible to those who need it. Most importantly, the bill aims, by establishing a new framework for the Administrative Review Tribunal, to improve public trust and confidence in a key democratic institution and bring greater transparency to the quality of government decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will mean that the key features of the Administrative Review Tribunal will include a simple membership structure with clear qualification requirements and role descriptions for member of the tribunal. And I repeat that: clear qualification requirements—that those people making decisions must be qualified to do the job. It will have clearly defined roles and responsibilities for those who hold leadership positions within the tribunal, and a transparent and merit-based appointment process for members of the ART—and I will come back to that in a moment. The president of the ART will be allowed to manage the performance, conduct and professional development of its members. It will have a suite of powers and procedures allowing the tribunal to respond flexibly to changing case loads, and there will be mechanisms to identify, escalate and report on systemic issues in administrative decision-making, as well as the re-establishment of the Administrative Review Council. Finally, the bill will mean the abolition of the Immigration Assessment Authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all those, especially those out with our communities and in organisations, who have taken the time to make submissions on this bill. Many of those submissions have noted that the bill lays out a solid framework to improve the current appeal review process. However, there are still some shortcomings that will require remedy and which I know the government is actively considering. First is the question of the independence of merit based appointments, and that can be strengthened. I know the member for Mackellar has proposed amendments to do exactly that, to ensure that the use of assessment panels in the appointment process is mandated and to require that the minister make appointments from these panels' shortlisted candidates. I note that there have been discussions with the government in this respect, and I certainly hope and expect that the government will introduce amendments themselves during consideration in detail. Of course, in cases where a suitable candidate can't be found through the process, the minister is required to table a statement of reasons in any case where an appointment is made against panel advice and merit based process. We must get to that merit based process and explanations as to departures from recommendation. These amendments will ensure that the political cronyism and jobs for mates culture which we saw under the old Administrative Appeals Tribunal can be a thing of the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another omission of this bill is a statutory review clause, so I have proposed an amendment in relation to providing a statutory review provision, because we have to be realistic and make sure that we review this to make sure that it works as intended. Again, I note discussions with the Attorney-General and his team and thank his office for their engagement. I also note that, whilst I have an amendment that I have proposed for the consideration in detail stage, there may well be progress from the Attorney-General's office themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous AAT had fallen into such a depth of disrepute that a statutory review of its replacement must be made at reasonable intervals to ensure that the same mistakes are not made again. The public has a right to know whether or not the ART is functioning as intended, free from political manipulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that the reinstatement of the Administrative Review Council will provide an internal review mechanism to ensure that best practice is followed and that the quality of decision-making by the ART is of a high standard, given the effect it has on so many lives. Nevertheless, an independent, external statutory review process is essential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, public confidence in our institutions is vital for their legitimacy. I thank the Attorney-General and his office for hearing from many of us from the crossbench on proposed amendments. I will be supporting this bill. This is an important piece of legislation and the biggest reform of our system of federal decision-making in some time. I urge the government to consider constructive amendments, as I've said, put forward around these final areas that can be improved. We need to make sure that people's lives are not upended or frustrated through an inadequate review system of administrative decisions, as has been the case for too long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw, through the debacle of robodebt, the incredible level of harm that poor administrative decision-making in government decisions can cause. There must be a review process that is robust, that is fair and that is independent of political persuasion or political influence. The Australian public must be able to have confidence that they can bring an appeal to an administrative decision and have a fair hearing. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

There's a saying in Western democracies—and it's at the heart of the system of the separation of powers—that justice must not only be done but be seen to be done. That is crucially important if the public are going to have confidence in the review of decisions that are made by administrative bodies—effectively by arms of government—that affect the rights and the lives of Australian citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's fair to say that, under the previous government, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and how it was operated did not provide that justice was seen to be done, because the previous government stacked that body with political appointments. They appointed dozens and dozens of individuals from the one political party to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Many of those appointments were for individuals who possessed no relevant experience or expertise, some of whom were active lobbyists. The problems at the AAT extended beyond the absence of merit based selection processes under the former government. The Albanese government is committed to restoring trust—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr Burke:</span>
                    </a>  Just on a point of order, should the issue arise again either today or on subsequent days, under standing order 78 there's a list of resolutions which includes the one that we just voted on. It then concludes by saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Should any of these questions be negatived, no similar proposal shall be received if the Speaker is of the opinion that it is an abuse of the orders or forms of the House, or is moved for the purpose of obstructing business.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember this one because it was used against me when, daily, I was moving that the member for New England be no further heard. Speaker Smith then set a precedent that, once the House had made clear on one occasion that they intended to continue with debate, that resolution would not be entertained again until the following week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've now had two of these in a day. On each occasion, the House has voted that we, in fact, did want to continue with debate. I would simply ask that, should the issue arise again, that bottom part of standing order 78 be considered by you, Mr Speaker, or whoever is in the chair at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  The Leader of the House has raised the issue of standing order 78(f), and there are a series of motions there, and that relates particularly to standing order 80. So, moving forward, in line with previous practice, it'll be the direction of the chair to ensure that the debate continues. I give the call to the member for Kingsford Smith.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence, Assistant Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Assistant Minister for the Republic</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  These reforms—to abolish the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and replace it with a new and improved Administrative Review Tribunal—are quite significant. Australians deserve a new federal administrative review body that is user focused, efficient, accessible, independent and fair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned, before, the previous government's stacking of the AAT. But that wasn't it. There were other inefficiencies that were part of the government's administration of the AAT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new government inherited an AAT without a sustainable financial footing. The AAT had been struggling with delays and an extraordinarily large and growing backlog of applications, and it was operating multiple and ageing electronic case-management systems. It was yet another bleak legacy of the former government. The coalition's mismanagement of the amalgamation of the AAT with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal was another feature of that government's mismanagement. It appointed as many as 85 former Liberal MPs, failed Liberal candidates, former Liberal staffers and other close Liberal associates, without any merit based selection process whatsoever. The AAT never stood a chance of maintaining independence and an efficient decision-making process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An ineffective administrative review system comes at a very real cost to the tens of thousands of people who rely on the AAT each year. They need to have trust in the process of the independent review of government decisions that have major and sometimes life-altering impacts on their lives. These Australians were abandoned by the previous government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General announced that the design of the new body would be subject to consultation in 2023, and it was. There was significant consultation that took place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this bill, the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023, establishes a new and much-improved tribunal, with the objective of providing independent administrative review that is fair and just; that resolves applications in a timely manner and with as little formality—and expense, of course—as possible; that is accessible and responsive to the diverse needs of the parties; that improves the transparency and quality of government decision-making; and that promotes trust from the public and confidence in the ART. That is the most significant reform that is under debate here: that this government, the Albanese government, is restoring trust and confidence in the operations of the Administrative Review Tribunal. The Australian people can have that trust because this government is keen to ensure that they have a body that caters for their interests.</span>

At the outset, I'll say: these bills are now the subject of a Senate committee review, and, in the circumstances, it would be most appropriate that they be dealt with following the Senate's consideration. I say that also as a member of the House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, which also had a very brief window of opportunity to look at this legislation during the Christmas period.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I will turn to a more fundamental aspect of this legislation: that a robust administrative law jurisdiction is absolutely pivotal to Australian democracy. It ensures accountability and transparency in government decision-making processes. By providing avenues for judicial review of administrative decisions, it upholds the principles of legality, ensuring that government agencies act within their legal authority and in accordance with established laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Administrative review is the process by which a person or a body other than the primary decision-maker reconsiders the facts, laws and policy aspects of the original decision and determines the correct and preferable decision. The idea is that the new decision-maker steps into the shoes of the original, primary decision-maker, and so it is a review on the merits of a decision rather than being so much a legal challenge. But, if the reviewer considers that the original decision was not the correct and preferable decision, they can then step into those shoes, as I've said, and substitute their decision for the original decision. This strengthens the rule of law by fostering public trust in the fairness and integrity of governmental actions, ultimately safeguarding the democratic rights and freedoms of Australian citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under our common law system, any Australian citizen or person with the appropriate standing in a legal sense may seek judicial review of administrative action by decision-makers. So the administrative law process we have in our country is an opportunity for a merits review of administrative action that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick—or that is the way that the AAT was initially established. I believe strongly in the rule of law and I do believe strongly in a robust administrative law system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that, with the AAT having now been in existence for several decades, reform may be warranted but the overall merits of these changes are questionable. Since 2015, for example, the AAT has experienced a significant spike in the number of lodgements of cases. It increased from 41,400 in 2015-16 to a peak of 60,595 in 2018-19. This spike has been driven by a range of factors, including the legacy case load that arose from Labor's unauthorised maritime arrivals. In addition, the amalgamation of different tribunals into the AAT in 2015 created legacy issues, such as different systems and processes operating in parallel with different parts of the tribunal. These are certainly issues that I say do warrant scrutiny and reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, what the government is proposing is the wholesale abolition and replacement of the AAT, and this creates significant transitional challenges, such as transferring a large existing case load, rolling out new systems and dealing with staff turnover and recruitment lags. So these challenges may, in fact, lead to additional and unintended delays. It remains to be seen whether the legally significant changes, particularly in the migration space, will drive further lodgements or lead to a further spike in litigation. So the systematic and downstream impacts of these changes are unclear, and, while it might be appropriate that there is a system of review, the AAT is one part of a complex system and changes to one part of this system could well affect various others, with unintended consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms in the bills, as proposed by the Attorney-General and the government, only address one part of the system, and it is again unclear what those unintended consequences may be. By way of example to explain that proposition, if the AAT were to significantly increase the rate at which it processed reviews of visa refusals, it is almost inevitable that the federal courts would then be hit with a wave of judicial review applications. These broader impacts should be considered as part of a committee inquiry, and that is only one reason why I say that it is appropriate that this is first of all dealt with by the Senate committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to look at the stated purpose of this bill, it's to establish the Administrative Review Tribunal, to replace the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The new bill sets out 11 different provisions, or parts, that relate to the new proposed tribunal's membership structure, review procedures and various other matters. The proposed legislation also re-establishes a body known as the Administrative Review Council and makes consequential amendments to a number of Commonwealth acts. As I said, these three bills have been referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for both inquiry and report by 24 July 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of further background, the AAT and the entire Commonwealth administrative review system was initially lauded as an innovative model of tribunal reform. But over time it has faced an ever-increasing range of challenges, and since the eighties numerous inquiries and government reports have documented these challenges and recommended a series of major reforms. Some of those major reform recommendations have been picked up by successive governments, and others have not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially, the problems and failures of the AAT appear to have risen as a result of the proliferation of specialist merit review tribunals and the subsequent attempts at amalgamating these separate bodies into a single unified tribunal, which was the original intention of the legislation. Of course, with this there have also been significant resourcing pressures, with a corresponding dramatic rise in the matters being reviewed resulting in enormous backlogs preventing the timely and final resolution of matters. These problems have been particularly evident in migration and review matters, where the delays are enormous and therefore unfair and certainly need to be addressed. Overall, there are 11 parts to the way that the bills are structured that deal with things such as the powers and proceedings, membership and structure, any special tribunal procedures and, particularly, processes in intelligence and security matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a background overall to the Australian merit review system, the foundations were laid, as I said before, in the mid-1970s, and the AAT commenced operations on 1 July 1976. It's probably appropriate to look briefly at the legislative framework under which the AAT currently operates. It is the Commonwealth's largest tribunal in terms of both its membership and its scope to hear cases. When the AAT was initially established, it was stated it would be the merits review tribunal for all Commonwealth administrative decisions, unless specific policy considerations support review conducted by an alternative body. As I said, one of the issues that has been highlighted by successive reviews and inquiries is the proliferation of other tribunals, which has led to unintended consequences within the AAT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Presently the AAT members consist of a president, who must be a Federal Court judge, and various members known as deputy presidents and senior members as well as members. It currently has a workload of nine divisions which cover areas of Commonwealth decision-making, including migration, the NDIS, freedom of information, taxation and some other miscellaneous Commonwealth legislation. As I've said, the challenges that the AAT faces are that it is beset by delays, dramatic increases in workload and an extraordinarily large backlog of applications. These problems have been particularly highlighted in the migration and refugee division, where the latest figures confirmed that in the 2020-21 year the percentage of cases finalised within 12 months was 20 per cent. Clearly, 80 per cent of cases are taking more than one year to conclude, and that is not a just and fair outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a number of concerns raised by various bodies and stakeholders about these figures. The Law Council in particular has said that there is the need to increase the number and timeliness of decisions as well as to increase the number of appropriately qualified and experienced members, particularly in the migration and refugee division and other divisions. The New South Wales Bar Association took the view that AAT members should have a sufficient level of competence to make the 'correct or preferable administrative decision'. The Bar Association also described the negative impacts that cascaded from members lacking relevant expertise. So, while there are certainly some changes that have been highlighted by specialist bodies and sectors, it is still not clear as to why the Attorney-General is suggesting that the entire AAT regime be ripped up and a new body put in its place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other major change within this legislation is the re-establishment of a body called the Administrative Review Council, its task being to monitor and provide advice to the government in relation to Commonwealth administrative review. Whether that is just a symptom of a desire for larger government, or a body that will provide sound advice and will be an important part of the administrative law regime remains to be seen. I think we should wait to hear what the Senate inquiry has to say about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I sat on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. We adopted an inquiry into this legislation on 14 December 2023 and we were required to present that report to the Attorney-General in February 2024. That was, of course, right over the Christmas period. Although the recommendations of the committee overall were that the legislation be supported, the coalition comments were that, while we did not provide dissenting comments, we—I and the other coalition members, the member for Menzies and Mr Conaghan—said we strongly believe that such a large change to Australia's system of administrative appeals needs in inquiry where stakeholders from across the board are given ample opportunity to express their views. That was in the context of only one day of public hearing into what is a significant change to our whole system of administrative law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, administrative law is a tenet of our legal system but, based on the current delays and backlog of cases, it is appropriate that consideration is given to the way that the tribunal functions. However, it is unclear why this legislation was rammed through a House committee process and why it is now being rammed through parliament when it has been referred to a Senate inquiry. I would say that the most appropriate thing is to wait until July and consider the comments from the Senate inquiry.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265990" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I rise to make my contribution the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023 and the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 1) Bill 2023. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal was established in 1975 by former attorney-general the Hon. Kep Enderby QC. It was the Whitlam Labor government that acted to address the growing problem of the review of administrative law. As the former attorney-general bluntly said, it was an area of confusion where lawyers rarely went and only fools entered. The problem was that, as governmental discretionary powers and responsibilities expanded, there was not a similar development of mechanisms for independent review. There were various review tribunals created, but none providing the coordination and efficiency that were desperately needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As expected, it was a Labor government that sought to reform a messy system and to instead create what the then attorney-general outlined as a system of rational dispensation of justice. He spoke of the AAT as a significant milestone in the development of administrative law in this country, providing the machinery to ensure that persons are dealt with fairly and properly in their relationships with government. It's a great shame, then, to see what the former government's stewardship had wrought on the AAT. By appointing as many as 85 former Liberal MPs, candidates, staffers and other Liberal associates without any merit based selection process—including some individuals with no relevant experience or expertise—the former government fatally compromised the AAT, undermining its independence and eroding the quality and efficiency of its decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government inherited an AAT that is not on a sustainable financial footing, is beset by delays and an extraordinarily large and growing backlog of applications, and, furthermore, is operating multiple ageing electronic case management systems, a legacy of the former government's mismanagement of the amalgamation of the AAT with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. These mistakes and inactions have come at a very real cost to the tens of thousands of people who rely on the AAT each year to independently review government decisions that have a major and sometimes life-altering impact on them. I've spoken with many constituents over the years who've felt that they have been left in a state of perpetual limbo due to these delays, on issues ranging from the NDIS to immigration. So often, I hear that it is the uncertainty that people find the hardest and that any outcome, one way or another, would be preferable to waiting years for a decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So now, just as in 1975, it is a Labor government that has come to the sensible decision that significant and true reform is required, rather than trying to repair what has become a deeply flawed system. In late 2022, the Albanese government announced its decision to abolish the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and replace it with a new federal administrative review body. The new body will be called the Administrative Review Tribunal. The Attorney-General commenced consultation for the design of the new body early in 2023. The government intends that the tribunal will commence operations in 2024, subject to the timing of the passage of these bills. An appointment process for members of the ART is already underway. The government has also made it clear that the AAT cases that are currently in progress when the AAT is abolished will be transitioned to the new body automatically. The Attorney-General's Department is working with the AAT and government agencies and any other stakeholders to identify and plan practical steps required to implement the reform following the passage of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is committed to restoring trust and confidence in Australia's system of administrative review, beginning with the establishment of a new administrative review body that is user focused, efficient, accessible, independent and fair. We will endeavour to ensure that people are dealt with fairly and properly in their relationships with government. To that end, a central feature of the new body will be a transparent and merit based selection process for the appointment of the non-judicial members. This is in stark contrast to how the former government operated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ART Bill builds on 50 years of experience, learning and broad consultation to establish a tribunal that is user focused, efficient, accessible and fair. The ART Bill implements all three recommendations from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee's review into the performance and integrity of Australia's administrative review system. It also implements four recommendations from the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme and the government responses to two recommendations from the Rapid Review into the Exploitation of Australia's Visa System.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tribunal's objective will be to provide an independent mechanism of review that is fair and just; resolves applications in a timely manner with as little formality and expense as is consistent with reaching the correct or preferable decision; is accessible and responsive to the diverse needs of all parties; improves the transparency and quality of the decision-making; and promotes public trust and confidence in the tribunal. It will achieve these objectives by incorporating some key features. There will be a simpler and more consistent process and an emphasis on non-adversarial approaches to resolving applications. It will have a suite of powers and procedures to respond flexibly to the changing case loads and help resolve cases more efficiently and effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will have a simple membership structure with clear qualification requirements and role descriptions for each level of measurement. There will be clear and delineated roles and responsibilities for those who hold leadership positions in the tribunal, including for the president and the principal registrar. It will have a transparent and merit based appointment process for members, informed by the operational needs of the tribunal, to ensure only the highest quality members are appointed to these important roles, and it will have powers for the president to manage performance and to conduct professional development and review of members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ART Bill also has a mechanism to identify, escalate and report on systemic issues in administrative decision-making, including through the re-establishment of the Administrative Review Council. The council will monitor the integrity of the Commonwealth administrative review system, inquire into systemic challenges in administrative law and support education and training for Commonwealth officers in administrative decision-making and law. This will implement recommendations 20.5 and 23.4 of the robodebt report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also establishes for the first time a guidance appeal panel within the tribunal to resolve matters raising systemic issues and review tribunal decisions that may be affected by error. The guidance and appeals panel would provide a mechanism for escalating significant issues and addressing material errors in tribunal decisions. This would promote consistent tribunal decision-making and rapid responses to emerging issues both within the tribunal and from government departments and agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also establishes the tribunal to publish any decision subject to de-identifying and redacting sensitive information and requires it to publish all decisions involving significant conclusions of law, with implication for Commonwealth policy or administration. I note that the amendments that have been introduced ensure the publication of de-identified decisions that can proceed by amending secrecy positions in family assistance law. This will implement recommendation 20.4 of the robodebt report—but for all decisions, not just social security decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequential and transitional bill repeals the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, to be replaced by the tribunal established by the ART Bill. It amends 138 Commonwealth acts, covering 93 per cent of the AAT's current case load, to ensure the existing legislation operates as intended for the new tribunal. It updates hundreds of references across the Commonwealth statute book, streamlining the various regimes that currently apply to reviews of matters in the tribunal. In particular, this bill retains the essential modifications to the operation of the merits review framework for tax and charity matters, which ensures the workability of these frameworks, protects tax revenue collection and otherwise upholds longstanding core tax principles and practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill abolishes the Immigration Assessment Authority and harmonises provisions relating to the reviews of migration and refugee decisions, providing a broader suite of tools for efficient and effective resolution of these matters. This bill will also adjust the exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule for migration and protection matters so that it continues to codify matters relating to notification, non-disclosable information and requirements on what information must and must not be put to an applicant for comment before certain powers are exercised. This enables flexibility for the tribunal to reduce delays and backlogs in migration and refugee matters, increases fairness for genuine applicants and maintains the integrity of the migration system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill continues existing pathways and protections for the review of matters involving sensitive national security or intelligence information, with enhancements to simplify drafting and promote consistent approaches. It further maintains merits review for two separate bodies, as a unique feature of veterans' entitlement law, with matters reviewed in the Veterans' Review Board continuing to be appealable under the ART. The bill promotes consistency and simplicity by repealing special arrangements that overlap, duplicate or unnecessarily displace core provisions of the ART Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequential and transitional amendment bill also contains measures to give effect to the transition from the AAT to the ART. This includes transitioning the tribunal's active, pending and potential case loads, including matters currently before the courts, to minimise disruption and maintain review rights. The bill contains conditions for certain AAT members to transition to the ART and sets out arrangements for certain members who don't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has made a commitment to restoring integrity and faith in governmental systems and administration. The ART is another prime example of Labor making the necessary reforms to ensure that Australians have an appeals process that is user focused, efficient, accessible, independent and fair. And that is what the constituents of Werriwa really want. When they go to the AAT they expect to have an answer quickly and an answer they can be sure of. Further to that commitment, there will be a statutory review of this legislation approximately five years from the commencement of the bill, ensuring the ART remains fit for purpose into the future. I commend the bill, and the associated bills, to the House.</span>

                    <a href="299623" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SCAMPS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  I rise today in support of the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023 and the associated bills. This bill will establish a new administrative review tribunal to replace the abolished Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I congratulate the Attorney-General and his team, and welcome the work they have done to both strengthen the integrity and improve the efficient functioning of the review tribunal. It is one of the most important institutions underpinning our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A welcome aspect of the new ART is that it re-establishes the Administrative Review Council. This council was abolished in 2015 under the Abbott government. The function of the Administrative Review Council will include monitoring the integrity of the Commonwealth administrative review system, inquiring into and reporting on systemic challenges in administrative law, and supporting education and training for Commonwealth officials in relation to administrative decision-making and the law system. It is an important body.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the old Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which was established in 1976, the ART will conduct merits reviews of administrative decisions made under the Commonwealth laws, including decisions made by Australian government ministers, departments and agencies. This means that when people feel the government has made a decision affecting them that is wrong or not fair they can apply to the tribunal for a review of that decision. Such a review takes all the facts into account and does so from the perspective of the original decision-maker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I also rise today to call for crucial amendments to this bill that ensure the integrity and competence of the new ART cannot be easily compromised by allowing the door to remain open for future jobs-for-mates style appointments. I am concerned that the proposed appointments process for members to the new tribunal as proposed in this bill is not adequately independent or robust, as it remains at the discretion of the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 209 of the bill reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Minister may, from time to time, establish one or more panels … of persons to assess a candidate or candidates for appointment as a member.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hardly a watertight, independent appointment process. Let's not forget it was the exploitation of the appointments process by previous ministers that led to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal being stacked with cronies and needing to be abolished.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As currently drafted, there is nothing in the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023 which would prevent appointments to the ART from being misused for political purposes or cronyism in the future, in the same way we saw happen with the AAT. The good news, though, is that, in partnership with the Centre for Public Integrity, I have already done a lot of the work to address this incredibly significant issue. The Centre for Public Integrity has deep expertise in the integrity of Australia's political system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In February 2023 I introduced a private member's bill, the Transparent and Quality Public Appointments Bill 2023—otherwise known as my ending-jobs-for-mates bill. This bill aims to transform the process of appointments to major Commonwealth positions by making it far more independent of political influence. Underlying my ending jobs for mates bill was the critical and urgent need to restore the public's trust in our democratic processes and institutions after a decade of cronyism and political appointments that eroded that trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this term, the new government has made some very significant steps to boost the integrity of our political system. These include the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission and the abolition of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As mentioned, the abolition of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was necessary because the independence and competence of that institution had been too deeply compromised by political appointments in recent years. This was a highly significant decision as the AAT was a crucial pillar of our democracy, tasked with holding governments and departments to account by reviewing their decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is this ART Bill, which we are currently debating, that will establish the AAT's replacement institution. Unfortunately, this ART Bill, in its current form, does little to address the very flaw which resulted in the demise of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The bill lacks a mechanism to ensure the independent assessment of candidates for important ART roles or any transparency mechanism to give confidence in that assessment and selection process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My ending jobs for mates bill would ensure that all major Commonwealth public appointments were made within such an independent and transparent framework. The bill would legislate a public appointments commissioner and departmental independent selection panels, which would be overseen by a parliamentary joint committee on appointments. The oversight committee would not have a government led majority, guaranteeing independence from the government of the day. Under my ending jobs for mates bill, a degree of ministerial discretion would be maintained, as this is an important element of our Westminster system of government. So the final decision regarding a successful candidate would remain with the relevant minister; however, the minister may only choose from a shortlist of candidates approved by the independent selection panel. Such a framework would ensure that key positions in our democratic institutions are filled through an independent, transparent and expertise based appointment process. Not utilising an independent assessment panel for appointments to the ART will see it beset by the same fatal flaw which resulted in the abolition of its predecessor. I refer to my ending jobs for mates private members bill today to demonstrate that introducing amendments that embed an independence requirement into the ART appointments process is straightforward if there is the political will to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does the government's ART bill propose for appointing members, and how is it inadequate? The bill, as currently drafted, says that the minister may establish assessment panels to assess candidates for appointment, but they are not required to do so. Additionally, there is no requirement for the minister to act on the advice of any panel if they choose to establish one, nor is there a requirement that the minister report to parliament if they choose a candidate that the assessment panel did not recommend. The use of selection panels in the current proposal for ART appointments is entirely discretionary and therefore cannot be relied upon to ensure independence in this selection process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, there are a number of steps lacking in the process for appointments to the ART for it to be independent and transparent. As set out in the draft of this bill: it lacks any specificity on the requirement to advertise positions; it lacks a clear definition of merit; it lacks a mandated requirement to involve assessment panels in the selection process; it lacks a requirement to appoint from a shortlist of candidates as proposed by an independent panel; and it lacks a requirement to report to parliament if the minister selects a candidate not approved by an independent assessment panel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since introducing my ending jobs for mates bill in February 2023, I have sought to negotiate amendments to other government bills, which would have established independent selection processes for major appointments under those bills. Examples include: the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Independent Review) Bill 2023, the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service Bill 2023, the Jobs and Skills Australia Amendment Bill 2023 and the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022. Each time I have proposed these amendments and sought to negotiate them with government, the government has relied upon the existence of merit provisions in each piece of legislation as the basis for rejecting my amendments. Each time I have explained that there is a difference between merit and independence. Merit, of course, is critical. We must ensure that these important positions are filled only with the highest calibre of applicants with expertise in the relevant fields. But a candidate could fulfil that requirement, and have the right qualifications for the job, but also have been the best man at the minister's wedding or could take summer holidays with them. Ministers could, hypothetically, hand-pick well-qualified friends for a role and then be in a position to have significant influence over them in the execution of their duties. Merit and independence are not the same thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Attorney-General announced the abolition of the AAT in December 2022, he stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The AAT's public standing has been irreversibly damaged as a result of the actions of the former government over the last nine years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Analysis by the Australia Institute found that up to 40 per cent of appointments to the AAT under the Morrison government were jobs-for-mates-style political appointments. However, this bill, in the way it is currently drafted, will not prevent this happening again. It is clear there is a problem that requires a solution. To fail to address this problem in the new Administrative Review Tribunal would be to make the very same mistake that caused the AAT to be abolished in the first place and has cost the taxpayer a huge sum. Right now, we have the opportunity to learn from this mistake and to rectify it. The question remains: why would the government take the extraordinary step of abolishing one of the Commonwealth's most crucial democratic institutions because its appointments process was faulty and flawed, only to replace it with a new institution which suffers the same flaw? It simply does not make sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The solution to genuinely end the jobs-for-mates culture that has pervaded federal politics in recent years is simple: my 'Ending jobs for mates' bill, or a similar framework in relevant legislation. The process it establishes would be effective, cheap and not difficult to implement. The National Anti-Corruption Commission is tasked with investigating alleged corruption after it has occurred. However, parliament should strive to strengthen the integrity infrastructure of our democracy wherever possible, in order to prevent the erosion of our democracy from occurring in the first place. To not legislate a mandated, independent appointments process in the new ART would be to leave a critical pillar of our democracy weakened and vulnerable to distortion and political influence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To summarise, this bill to create a new administrative review tribunal needs to include the provision that, when new members are being appointed to the tribunal, an independent assessment panel must—not just 'may'—be used. This provision needs to be legislated to ensure it happens. Prior to the 2022 election, the Albanese government promised to rebuild trust in the integrity of our democracy and democratic institutions. Without a mandated and legislated independent selection process for the ART, in this instance the government would be failing to do this.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300122" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:13</span>):  I am grateful to the House for the opportunity to provide some comments in relation to these bills, the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023 and the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 1) Bill 2023, and to speak with specificity to the role of administrative review within our democracy more broadly. I want to talk, first and foremost, about that role of an administrative review body—the importance of it, why it's important, to whom it is important and some of the basic principles that are required in order for it to perform its function, in a theoretical sense, most efficiently. I want to then move on to the historical Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the AAT, and the dysfunctions that have beset that body—the challenges it has faced both structurally and culturally which have meant that it has not been able to serve its purpose for the Australian people as it should. Then I want to move on to the subject of these bills, the Administrative Review Tribunal, and talk about many of the structural elements of its establishment that will go a long way towards addressing those fundamental issues around the confidence that the Australian public can have in the process and indeed the body that conducts that process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As some of my colleagues have noted, the fundamental role of an administrative review body is to provide a merits-based review process for matters of administrative decision-making across or adjacent to government. That means the body isn't necessarily tasked with re-examining the technicalities or particulars around any particular case on which a decision is being made, although it does have some purview in order to explore those important factors. Rather, a merits based review allows for a higher level re-examination of the process itself and indeed its implementation in terms of that decision-making process. The reason it is so critically important is that this is a process, and a body that upholds that process, that provides the public with confidence in broader public administration and in the very institutions of our democracy that our government and our community rely on on a daily, weekly and annual basis in order for government to function efficiently and effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is something of a safety net that acts to ensure the fairness of the process, including in terms of its design, in that the process is fit for purpose—that, from some historical point at which a process might be made, it remains fit for purpose as circumstances evolve over time. Indeed, I think the bills before us and the Administrative Review Tribunal that will be established will go some significant way to improving that feedback loop, It's also to ensure that the current process is implemented in a fair and proper manner and is in many ways consistent with the expectations of the community, whom ultimately these processes are supposed to serve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These merits based reviews also have a role particularly in serving parts of our community who have a higher need, who are engaging with government and public administration in a particularly critical way. It particularly serves the interests of those who face broader structural disadvantage, and ultimately those are people who are more likely to be engaging with public administration; they are more likely to be subject to the decision-making of public administration. They from time to time have less power in terms of understanding, engaging with or challenging decisions of public administration. Ultimately the impacts of those decisions may be more critical to the lives, the health and the prosperity of communities that face structural disadvantage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at my own community and at the parts of my community that face structural disadvantage. They are engaged on a regular basis, whether through the Centrelink system, the NDIS system or a whole range of other government systems, in the process of making application, having their circumstances reviewed through those processes and having a decision issued to them, without necessarily having an absolute understanding of that decision-making process itself, and sometimes without recourse to challenge that decision through other legal mechanisms, for example. So an administrative review body provides this critical safety net in terms of ensuring fairness both in terms of the process itself and its implementation in the decision-making processes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, we know that there have been profound dysfunctions with the AAT. As this has been discussed throughout the debate, I don't want to dwell on it too much. I will say that there are many decent people of various political persuasions who have worked very hard to uphold the principles of an administrative review body through their work on the AAT, and we need to be cautious in our comments and indeed pay tribute to those people, some of whom are from a political background and some from other diverse backgrounds, who have worked diligently in that space. I don't wish to make this a partisan point. There have been many people from a range of diverse backgrounds who have made profound contributions in that space and who have worked tirelessly to serve our community through their work on the AAT. It is important that it be registered and indeed acknowledged that there are many people who fit into that category. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, unfortunately, under the former government and particularly former prime minister Morrison, the very good work of many very decent members of the AAT was seriously compromised by a range of appointments that, frankly, were not consistent with the community expectations of public administration appointments. As I said, some of my colleagues have already discussed the fact that 85 former Liberal MPs, failed Liberal candidates, former Liberal staffers and other close Liberal associates and mates around the place were appointed to this body in quick succession, and that, ultimately, they were appointed without a transparent merits based appointment process. I want to be clear: I'm not saying for a second that all of those appointments were without merit; what I'm saying is that the process of appointment failed to provide public confidence around the meritocracy of those appointments, and that was a fundamental failure of administration. As a result, the public lost confidence in the AAT and its membership. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The very unfortunate thing about this is that for very many—and I would suggest that it was probably a majority—of those people who were working so diligently within the AAT, the failure to ensure public confidence in that appointment process polluted the well for everybody. I feel for many of those members and staff of the AAT who did work diligently and who were passionate about upholding community expectations through that work that the former government's absolutely abhorrent process around appointments has left them in an awkward, uncomfortable and unreasonable position in terms of the question mark that is hanging over the legitimacy of that institution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of that, or certainly sitting alongside that, we have a whole range of broader dysfunctions that have been occurring within that tribunal environment. For me, they are summed up by the idea of the sustainability of such a tribunal. We've got issues around the financial sustainability of that tribunal. We've got some very profound issues around the ability of that tribunal, as it was previously constructed, to manage its own case load and to manage its own information control. We've got to remember that this is an organisation that is dealing with some very sensitive information, some very sensitive matters and, in some cases, some very vulnerable people. For an organisation like that to lack the ability to manage its own case load, certainly in a way that was consistent with the community's expectations, created a contingent risk. That risk grew on a daily basis as that organisation fell further and further behind in terms of its ability to manage the case load, manage the information and, indeed, support the members of the community that were relying on it so heavily to ensure fairness in these matters that were so critical to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, where that left us, as I said before, was at an absolute collapse in public confidence in the AAT—a collapse in the public's confidence in the AAT's abilities to perform its duties, to ensure fairness; in the system design, the process design and in its implementation; and, of course, fairly or unfairly, in the individuals who were responsible for implementing that process in the AAT. These bills are designed to restore that public confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a critical institution of our democracy, and it is even more critical because it is fundamental to maintaining public confidence in other institutions of our democracy. It is an enabling institution, in some ways. This is why the creation of the Administrative Review Tribunal, as is laid out in these bills, is so critically important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some fundamental elements of the forthcoming Administrative Review Tribunal that will be fundamental departures from how these matters have been handled historically in the AAT environment. Obviously the first one here is an absolutely transparent, merit based appointment process—one that should not maintain, introduce or perpetuate any bias, in terms of politics or political persuasion in the appointments. I dare say that there will be appointments to the Administrative Review Tribunal—and I'm quite confident that I won't be in a position to necessarily provide my views on them—of people from political backgrounds, as a small subsection of what should be a much broader, representative group of people from across our community who are diverse in terms of their backgrounds, their contribution and their capacities. I dare say that we will see a much greater diversity in the appointments. And, as I said, transparency and merit based appointment will be critical to achieving that greater outcome. That will ensure that the public can have confidence in the people who sit on this Administrative Review Tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The structure of the tribunal will be based on a series of recommendations that have come down as a result of a range of other non-partisan processes, both across the parliament and outside of it. These include the three recommendations from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee's review of the performance and integrity of Australia's administrative review system; the four recommendations from the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme; and indeed the government's response to the two recommendations from the Rapid Review into the Exploitation of Australia's Visa System, amongst others. So these are critical recommendations that have been handed down after careful and considered review. They will be incorporated into the design of this body. We will have a transparent, merit based appointment process and a structure that is consistent with public expectation with regard to the Administrative Review Tribunal, ongoing. I commend these bills to the House.</span>

But this can't be right. You're convinced that the changes don't apply to your situation. You've read up on the rules, but it's so technical and hard to understand that you're hopelessly overwhelmed. You call Centrelink but can't get any answers, and your internal request for review goes nowhere. You don't know what to do. Without this extra money you'll struggle to pay your rent, which has already increased twice in the past few years. And, if these payment changes go through, you might have to start cutting down on food and cancelling that excursion for one of your kids.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="C2T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  This weekend, Tasmanians will head to the polls to decide the next state parliament, and, as is the case with all elections, the community is being bombarded with promises from the parties about how they will make our lives better. But this is what I'm hearing from my community about what they expect from the next Tasmanian government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a start, they expect a health system that works and not one constantly on the brink of collapse. For instance, our emergency department waiting times are above the national average, with only 52 per cent of patients seen on time compared with 65 per cent nationally. Moreover, 44 per cent of category 1 elective surgery patients weren't admitted within the clinically recommended time frame. All that is simply outrageous. Clearly, more funding is needed—though, to be clear, it isn't the only answer. For example, despite revenue and staff numbers increasing for the ambulance service over recent years, response times are up. In fact, Tasmanians are now waiting longer than at any other time in the last decade, in a clear sign that what's actually needed is substantial structural reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmanians also expect a safe and affordable place to live, but this has been out of reach for many, and it's getting worse. Indeed, we've seen a 45 per cent increase in homelessness in Tasmania since the last census, there are a record 4,700 people languishing on the housing waiting list, and more than half of mortgage holders in Clark are at risk of mortgage stress. Moreover, Hobart is the second least affordable capital city for renters, with rents ballooning by 60 per cent since 2016. Clearly, these figures are appalling, which is why the next government must significantly increase investment in social housing and crisis accommodation, streamline development approvals and strengthen renters' rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It must also pay far more attention to education because, shamefully, Tasmania ranks well behind the mainland states when it comes to education outcomes. For example, the latest report on government services shows that a mere 53 per cent of Tasmanians leave school with a year 12 or equivalent qualification, compared to 76 per cent nationally. No wonder around half of all Tasmanian adults are functionally illiterate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of young people, the next government must implement all the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings, including closing Ashley Youth Detention Centre urgently. As many in the community would recall, the commission's findings detailed horrific evidence of physical and sexual abuse, inhumane isolation practices, and strip and cavity searches of children. Yet the Liberals have pushed back their commitment to close the centre from 2024 to 2026, and Labor has also confirmed that it will not close the centre immediately. All of that is unconscionable, especially considering that the commission has flagged that there remains a live and current risk of sexual abuse of children in Ashley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also implore the next state government to swiftly implement the cashless gaming card, not least because Tasmanians lost almost $190 million on poker machines in the 2022-23 financial year, a 10½ per cent increase over a four-year period. While the Liberals supported the Tasmanian Liquor and Gaming Commission's recommendation to implement a statewide player card gaming system with precommitment and cashless gaming in 2022, we have seen no practical action, and shamefully, although unsurprisingly, we've heard nothing from Labor. Indeed, if Liberal and Labor are serious about addressing gambling harm, they must commit to implementing mandatory card play immediately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last, but certainly not least, the next government needs to get serious about protecting our environment. Yet all we've heard so far is a cynical attempt to reignite the forest wars, despite more than 680 Tasmanian plant and animal species being listed as threatened, including the swift parrot and the maugean skate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely the next Tasmanian government needs to start taking its responsibility as custodian of our state seriously, including by growing a backbone and standing up to the forestry and salmon industries, whose businesses are trashing Tasmania's clean, green reputation and undermining what Tasmanians and tourists value most about our state. If the last 10 years are anything to go by, the next government needs to actually start governing for a change. The community is sick and tired of politicians promising one thing and doing another. Until the political parties start listening to the community, their promises in Tasmania are nothing but empty words.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I was absolutely delighted to host hundreds of local residents on Saturday morning at the Hawke government services hub. The event brought together federal government agencies such as Services Australia, the ATO and the NBN as well as state and local government representatives, providing a one-stop shop for locals to get the information and help they need when engaging and working through processes with government agencies and government more broadly. We helped locals resolve issues, including working through their pension applications, NDIS packages and JobSeeker payments and ensured they were getting the assistance they needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to extend a very big thanks to the staff from all the agencies and organisations that attended and for coming out on a Saturday morning as well as my own colleagues from 'Team Hawke' for their hard work in pulling the event together. A very special big shout-out to the Melton Men's Group, a group that supports the mental and physical health of local men all across our community. They put on a fantastic sausage sizzle outside the event and made sure that no-one went hungry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sun was shining in my hometown of Ballan this Saturday as our community celebrated the annual Ballan Autumn Festival. Boasting 110 market stalls, 30 food vans, vintage cars and machinery, the wood choppers and a fantastic array of great family activities, the Ballan Autumn Festival had the town absolutely buzzing. People came from neighbouring townships and further afield to enjoy all the festival had to offer, especially the amazing street parade, which featured local schools, clubs and our emergencies services, including the CFA, my son's favourite part of the event. There were some incredible costumes, and wonderful dancers and brilliant musicians all marching and entertaining the crowd. My thanks and congratulations to Kevin Harper and the whole team behind the Ballan Autumn Festival for once again putting on a fantastic event for our local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sunbury's annual SunFest was back this weekend, celebrating a massive 48 years of serving the Sunbury community. SunFest featured market stalls, food trucks, fireworks, rides and performances by brilliant local musicians. I got to spend the day in the sun with the local state member for Sunbury, Josh Bull; as well as Hume City Council mayor, Naim Kurt; and Councillor Jarrod Bell, chatting to the tens of thousands of locals who descended on the village green for an absolutely great day out. I was honoured to judge the grand street parade, awarding prizes for some amazing costumes and decorations. A huge thanks to the organising community behind this event, led by President Craig McTaggart, for their hard work and dedication in delivering another spectacular and successful SunFest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Sunday I attended the annual Women in Rescue event in Pykes Creek Reservoir, in Myrniong, where the VICSES western region arranged a multi-agency training scenario for women in emergency services. This exceptional event showcased the talents and skills of our women volunteers on both land and water as they worked through a series of simulated emergency incidents. Our community is very, very fortunate to have such dedicated SES members, and this event was such a wonderful opportunity to acknowledge all that they do to keep our communities safe. I want to thank the SES western region for coordinating the day as well as the local SES teams, Victoria Police, St John's Ambulance, the CFA and the local Girl Guides for their participation in the great event and for their enormous and tireless contribution to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Specialist Hoops is an organisation founded and run by local legend Emily Attard to provide people living with disabilities the opportunity to get active and play basketball in a safe and supportive environment. Starting as a one-day program back in 2017, Specialist Hoops now runs regular weekly sessions at multiple locations across my electorate of Hawke, with almost 100 regular participants. I was very lucky to go along to one of their programs recently at the Cobblebank Indoor Stadium to meet the amazing volunteers behind the program and join in their training session. It's fair to say that I was not the best player on the court by any stretch of the imagination. There were some phenomenal basketball players there. The positivity and inclusive spirit of the participants and volunteers was very clear as they played by their motto, 'No-one gets left behind.' I want to commend Emily, an amazing young person, for the incredible program that she and her team of volunteers have built and thank them for providing this important service for our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="231027" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TAYLOR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  One of the things that I learned reasonably quickly in representing a regional area, an outer suburban area, in this place was just the degree to which community organisations are run by, typically, a small group of volunteers who you keep running into again and again and again. These tireless workers are the absolute backbone of our communities, and they provide us with the support, the vibrancy and the resilience that country towns and regional areas need in order to prosper and survive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to many of those volunteers, and, in fact, earlier this week I did pay tribute to a couple of our great seniors in Goulburn: Ray Strong and Jean Lloyd. But I want to pay tribute to many I have come across in the last couple of weeks. In particular, it has been regional show season, and, as I've travelled across the electorate for the regional shows, I've had the chance to enjoy many of the great fruits of the regions across Hume.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These shows are essential in promoting, celebrating and supporting our agricultural sectors, as well as our regional communities. The shows allow farmers, producers and rural communities to come together to showcase their products, produce, livestock and skills. They make an enormous contribution to regional communities, drawing in tourists and, of course, getting people out to have just a wonderful time. They also celebrate our great agricultural heritage. Of course, that is something that should always be celebrated because the work our farmers and those who work adjacent to the farming sector do is important for this great nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank, first and foremost, the incredible teams of volunteers that work so hard—throughout the year, I should say—to make these shows possible. The point so many of them make is that it is a year-long effort by the show committees to bring a great event to fruition. In particular, the shows I've visited in the last few weeks are led by Frank Hannan at Gunning; Michael Lowe, the president at Crookwell; Jacki Waugh at Goulburn; Laura Craig at Taralga; Jenny Hajek at Tarago; and David Dunbier at Camden—which I was lucky enough to visit last weekend. They all put on magnificent events. I should say, importantly, that, whilst it was a struggle for so many of these events through COVID, they are coming out fighting fit and strong on the other side, and we've seen that in recent weeks. I want to pay tribute to a couple of shows that I didn't get to, including at Luddenham, Boorowa and Picton, which always put on wonderful events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another magnificent volunteer run group across my electorate and, indeed, across all of Australia is parkrun. Run completely by volunteers for the local community, parkrun now has 485 runs across Australia. They come to life every Saturday morning, supported by more than 150,000 volunteers. This is an incredible success story, not just in Australia but right across the world, and I try to get to as many as I possibly can. In fact, this past weekend, before going to the Camden show, I got a chance to join the runners at the Camden parkrun at Cowpasture Reserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Started by Kim Rodgers, the Camden parkrun has become incredibly popular, and it was fantastic to see so many runners of all ages and abilities getting out and enjoying the event, as they do every weekend. We had well over 200 there. The numbers have increased dramatically in recent months, and that's really wonderful to see. Over time, it has been supported by over 300 volunteers, and those volunteers, of course, make this possible. One of the bits of magic about parkrun is the way it's able to enlist volunteers every weekend, right across this country, to put on these incredible events. The Camden parkrun event director from the start has been Steve Cooper—and good on you, Steve, for doing a great job. He got out there last weekend and was there as he so often is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it's not just Camden in my electorate. There's the Goulburn parkrun—my home park run, which I get to as much as I can—with the great race director Jaemin Frazer, who's a great community stalwart, as so many of these race directors are; and Picton, where Pamela McCabe does a great job. Goulburn's inaugural park run was in 2018, and has since hosted more than 250 events. I get to a few, and I'd like to get to more. Most of all, I thank all those wonderful people who support the park run every Saturday in my electorate and right across this great country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  The cost of living is dominating political discourse, and, while cost-of-living increases can in part be attributed to inflation and global instability, the more likely cause has been price gouging and profiteering by goods and service providers, with the COVID pandemic four years ago kickstarting much of that. The shutdowns during the COVID years had a dual effect on today's living-cost pressures. Firstly, the shortage of goods and services saw demand outstrip supply, which directly led to price hikes across so many lines. When supplies normalised and demand moderated, prices never fully reverted to their pre-COVID levels. Secondly, businesses' income losses caused by COVID restrictions are now being made up for with widespread price gouging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nor is it just the major food and grocery retailers—whom the spotlight is currently on—that engage in price gouging. It is happening widely by providers of so many essential daily services and goods. We see petrol prices fluctuate by up to 50 cents per litre, and they're always higher just before public and school holidays. Major sporting and entertainment venues price gouge, sometimes near-doubling of the prices of basic foods and drinks. Airlines are doubling the price of airfares for peak-time flights. For example, a Qantas economy seat one-way on the direct flight from Canberra to Adelaide on the Thursday before Easter is $981. Tradespeople exploit trade shortages and overcharge simply because they can, and CBD parking fees often cost more than the entrance cost to the event people are going to. Medical gap fees are charged by wealthy specialist doctors, who apply a 'take it or leave it' attitude to desperate people. Energy prices are in a convoluted market, where it is difficult—if not impossible—to pinpoint blame. Insurance premiums have surged over recent times beyond what may have been necessary to offset costs from natural disasters and higher repair and replacement costs. We even see unreasonable fines and fees charged by all three levels of government, who have a complete monopoly over what they do. I note today's Adelaide<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">dvertiser</span> front page suggests that Adelaide City Council residents and businesses are facing rate hikes of up to 7.4 per cent in addition to increases in fees and charges. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With a push towards a cashless society, there is also a growing trend of credit card surcharges being applied and adding to daily household costs. For anyone with a bank loan or a credit card debt, the interest rates are always much higher than the Reserve Bank rate. These are all examples of common costs that most people are faced with in their lives and which so many are struggling to meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, many of the providers of those services and goods are making record profits. It has been reported that between April and September 2023 corporate profits drove 53 per cent of inflation. Not surprisingly, the CBA announced a record $10.2 billion four-year profit in August last year, and in the first half of this year a $5 billion cash profit. The other three major banks showed similar trends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at other corporates, Qantas in 2023 made a statutory after-tax profit of $1.74 billion. AGL, for the six months ending 2023, made an underlying net tax profit of $339 million. Last year, IAG reported a net after-tax profit of $832 million, and Telstra's $2.1 billion profit was up 13 per cent. There are other examples I could point to which show the same pattern of businesses providing essential services making healthy profits while customers—the Australian people—struggle with living costs. Regrettably, in Australia price gouging is not illegal. We operate in a free-market society where free marketeers claim that market competition will drive prices down. Of course, we know that that is not, and never has been, the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to similar concerns 50 years ago, the Whitlam government established a prices justification tribunal, but subsequent governments abolished it. Right now, such a body or something similar is sorely needed so that consumers are not exploited and taxpayers do not have to provide cost-of-living relief to their fellow Australians whilst big corporates make big profits. </span>

                  <a href="235654" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOLAHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  On many occasions, I, and many others, often say, 'What would Christopher Hitchens say about the particular debate that's before us?' I was thinking of Christopher Hitchens recently, on, of all days, International Women's Day. I went to three events in my electorate, and I'd like to speak to those. In Australia, on the ABC show <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A</span>—which I was fortunate enough to be on recently—he said this when speaking of women's empowerment: 'The cure for poverty has a name, in fact. It's called the empowerment of women.' And he was right then and it is right to say now. That's not just something that applies to developing economies; it applies to our economy. The cure for productivity, the cure for fairness, and the cure for a better nation, a better Australia, is the empowerment of women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With that, the first of the three events that I'd like to single out in my electorate is the Manningham International Women's Day event, which was put on by Manningham Council. I thank those of Manningham Council who organised it, from CEO, Andrew Day, to the emcee of the day, Lee Robson. I also single out the female councillors at Manningham. There are five female councillors: Mayor Carli Lange, Laura Mayne, Deirdre Diamante, Anna Chen and Michelle Kleinert OAM. You all represent your wards in an inspiring, highly professional and effective way and I want to thank you for your service to our community on that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The guest speakers included Caroline Wilson; for those who are into their football, she's a well-known sports journalist who doesn't hold her punches when she has something tough to say about a very male-dominated sport. She appears on 3AW and <span style="font-style:italic;">Footy Classified</span> and has written in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>. Her discussions about what it was like breaking into a male-dominated area in the early days were very inspiring. Shane Dunne was on the panel and spoke about how the Richmond Football Club are pushing the boundaries of their club to set the standard for others. Courtney Jones, who was a player for the AFLW Richmond Tigers, also spoke. I'd particularly liked Courtney's explanation of how she first started playing footy on a men's team, or a boys' team at the time, and what that was like, and how it inspired her to have a career in an area that didn't exist when she was younger. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second event was the Doncare International Women's Day event. I want to thank the Doncare CEO, Ellen Matusko, Martine Corbett, the marketing and communications manager, Carly Kluge from Bendigo Bank and Mary-Anne Lowe, who hosted the event at Bramleigh Estate at no cost. Mary-Anne Lowe not only did that for this event; she has done it for many other events and I thank her and Bramleigh Estate for their generosity. There were 260 attendees, and Ian Goldsmith did a stellar job as the emcee. But I want to single out Jelena Dokic, who was the key speaker. What an inspiring person and inspiring Australian. Her speech was moving and powerful. The first words out of her mouth were words of abuse and terror told to her by her father. She told stories of things that happened behind the scenes, including having to cower and spend the night sleeping at Wimbledon because her dad said that she couldn't come home for the shame of losing a semi-final at Wimbledon. She is an inspiring person. I thank her for her speech that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third event was the Box Hill International Women's Day event, which all the Rotary clubs organised. There were 300 attendees. It was organised by Wendy Zhang, the chair of the International Women's Day Breakfast. The theme was 'Inspiring inclusion', and I thank everyone who was involved in that event. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also went to a local Chinese community event. It was the 25th anniversary of the Melbourne World Friendship Association of Fuqing. This is a community that exports probably more people than the Republic of Ireland, and they are very proud of it, and many are in Melbourne. For 25 years they have held onto their friends and their sense of their community, of where they have come from—and you could see that on the night. I thank the chairman, Derrick Chen, for the work he has done, and the CEO, Chino Li. It was an amazing event—one I was proud to attend and be part of.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  The term 'war crime' is one we hear often, but I want to explain what it actually means. This is important in light of the escalation of civilian deaths in Gaza, despite efforts to negotiate a peace by Australia and other countries with much more influence. Australia and many other countries have called for Israel to abide by the International Court of Justice ruling that it must take measures to prevent genocide in Gaza. It is tragic that, nearly six months on, the situation continues to be devastating, with little progress made towards a ceasefire. Meanwhile, the people of Gaza are suffering on a scale that is unimaginable. They are living with daily bombings, deaths and starvation, mainly because of Israel's refusal to let enough food into Gaza. Blocking that is both official and achieved via systemic go-slows and citizen action that is unlawful. How could anyone perpetrate such an act of barbarism on children?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I travelled to Israel as part of a parliamentary delegation—something not funded by lobbyists—and I witnessed the way Palestinians were treated. Their daily lives are ruled by checkpoints. I saw different roads for different races, and I know that there are two systems of justice for children based on race. Societies that have a two-tier system are never harmonious places. Today there are many in my community who feel helpless and angry and who are struggling to comprehend the enormity of the devastation and death. This conflict is extremely divisive. Everyone has an opinion, a story and a conspiracy theory, and some are devoted to lying about the facts. But the one thing we can all agree on is that the atrocities committed against civilians, regardless of who has committed them and why, deserve redress via international humanitarian law as enforced by the International Criminal Court in The Hague.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">International humanitarian law applies to armed conflicts and was largely a result of the horrors of World War II. Its core objective is to protect people who are not or who are no longer participating in a conflict, and to restrict the means and methods of warfare. Serious breaches of international humanitarian law are known as war crimes. International humanitarian law stems from the customary international law and the 1949 reviews of the Geneva conventions. Remember, those first three conventions cover soldiers, sailors and prisoners of war. The fourth, from 1949, relates to the protection of civilians, including those living in occupied territories. Additional protocols were added in 1977 concerning victims of international armed conflicts and victims of non-international armed conflicts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2004 the International Court of Justice designated that the Palestinian territories—that is, Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem—are under occupation. The International Committee of the Red Cross asserts that the legal framework in the Palestinian territories, certainly before 7 October, is the law of belligerent occupation. The International Committee of the Red Cross states:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">International humanitarian law protects those who do not take part in the fighting, such as civilians and medical and religious military personnel.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not here to list the war crimes committed since 7 October last year, but I want to call out the atrocities with the intention that the world holds all perpetrators to account. I am talking about the deliberate targeting of civilians—especially women and children—indiscriminate rocket attacks and the taking of civilians as hostages. I'm also talking about Israel's deliberate obstruction of basic services—water, fuel and aid to Gaza. These are the acts that Human Rights Watch have described as collective punishment that amount to war crimes and include the use of starvation of civilians as a weapon of war. The UN High Commissioner has grave concerns about Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack. The world is watching this horrific conflict.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  I regularly hear stories from veterans, their families and their loved ones, and, regrettably, all too often these stories detail problems veterans face when accessing the health and mental health care they desperately need. One of the reasons for this is that veterans are being left behind as DVA rates for health care continue to fall behind rebates offered by other government funded programs such as the NDIS. For example, last year I met with the Tasmanian branch president of the Australian Physiotherapy Association, who highlighted the inequity between rebates. He told me that, in his practice, all initial consultations are at least 45 minutes, with NDIS paying $168.45 and private patients paying $164.50. Unfortunately, though, the DVA fee is stuck at $70.80, regardless of the time spent with veterans in the initial consult, with no ability to charge a gap fee. As a result, 26 per cent of physiotherapists in Australia have already limited or stopped providing services to DVA clients, not because they don't passionately care about veterans but because their practice would not be financially viable if they were to continue treating DVA clients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have raised this issue personally with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who assured me that the government is aware of the issue. But still nothing has been done to fix it, and no solution seems to be on the horizon. Moreover, this inequity is not limited to allied health. Indeed, recently I heard from a DVA gold card holder who had been told by his GP that, because the DVA rebate didn't cover the cost of providing care, they would only see him as a private patient in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just funding problems that are creating difficulties for veterans accessing care; it's also a lack of harmonisation between federal and state government laws. For example, just last year the Therapeutic Goods Administration permitted medicines containing MDMA and psilocybin to be prescribed by authorised psychiatrists for people with certain mental health conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder and treatment-resistant depression, two conditions experienced at higher rates by veterans. But some states, including Tasmania, are yet to update their legislation, so, while the treatment is legal federally, it cannot be prescribed locally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's well known that veterans experience higher rates of mental ill health and often highly complex medical conditions as a direct result of their service, but just as often they cannot receive the care they need because of low rebates and delays with access to treatment. This must be addressed as a genuine priority of government because, quite frankly, anything less is simply not good enough.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  Today I want to take a few moments to remember a passionate advocate within my electorate of Adelaide, within South Australia and, in fact, nationally. She was a cancer advocate and a local in my area, Ms Lorraine Tyler. Sadly, Lorraine Tyler recently left us, after battling lung cancer. My heartfelt condolences extend to the entire lung cancer community; Lorraine's partner, Kirsten; her family and friends; and the Lung Foundation Australia lung cancer patient advisory group, which Lorraine chaired. In her memory, I'm going to read Lorraine's words. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In 2017 I was diagnosed with two primary cancers; breast cancer and lung cancer. I was not experiencing symptoms of either cancer. The breast cancer was picked up early, through screening, and was cured through two surgeries. A devastating diagnosis but an excellent outcome. Unfortunately the lung cancer was only found by accident, it had already spread, and it will most likely kill me. I wish there had been a lung cancer screening program in place to find my cancer early, just like the breast cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lorraine spoke with conviction on the importance of both the need for specialist lung cancer nurses and a targeted lung cancer screening program. While Lorraine herself was unable to access the potentially life-saving National Lung Cancer Screening Program, committed to launch in 2025, Lorraine knew the positive impact it would have on so many other Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we commemorate Lorraine's passing, let's also celebrate the legacy that she leaves behind: a legacy of advocacy, inspiration and a commitment to others. Lorraine Tyler was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia, for service to the community through a range of roles but primarily through advocating for early screening of lung cancer. In celebrating Lorraine's life, we acknowledge the profound legacy she leaves behind. She was a force for good, a catalyst for change and a beacon of hope.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lorraine will be remembered first and foremost for her tremendously positive outlook on life, one that was not defined by cancer. Her passion for screening and early detection to save lives has been noted by many in this place, including members of the Parliamentary Friends of Lung Health and Lung Cancer and ministers, many of whom noted meeting Lorraine as a clarion moment in advocacy and a wake-up call that lung cancer patients deserve better. Along with so many other things, the funding of specialist lung cancer nurses and the targeted Lung Cancer Screening Program are a part of her legacy. May she rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  It is a cult. It is a mad, mad cult that we have become a part of that says, in its peculiar form of devotion, a sort of pious devotion, that we can somehow, by regulations and legislations, go to war with the weather and change the temperature from this place. I want to give an example of the next peculiarity. First of all, we have this devotion to what they call wind farms, which are actually swindle factories, overseas owned with deemed rates of return. They say that a large section of the power price is poles and wires, so what are they proposing to do? Put up thousands upon thousands of kilometres of new poles and wires, even though the clear effect at the moment is to put up the price of power. But the most recent adornment of this cult is this: new building descriptions that have been brought about by a federal policy, the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme, otherwise known as NatHERS.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tamworth is 400 metres above sea level, but, in the most recent dictum of this new cult, we have been declared an alpine area. As we have now become an alpine area, I looked up 'alpine', and it said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">of, relating to, or resembling mountains and especially the Alps </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">of, relating to, or growing on upland slopes above the highest elevation where trees grow</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a quick look around Tamworth. Lo and behold, there are trees everywhere, even on Flagstaff Mountain. There are trees everywhere. In fact, it's surrounded by bush. Some of the trees are quite nice. In my whole time in Tamworth, I don't think it has ever snowed. But I tell you what this means, after this ludicrous cult. What this means is, as we build a new house in Tamworth, there will be an increase in the cost of roof insulation of $3,250 and wall insulation of $2,423 as well as an increase in the costs of internal wall insulation, slab insulation and glazing. The total increase in cost of a standard home build in Tamworth by reason of this cultish attachment to this bizarre new religion is over $46,000. You talk about cost of living. Where in this insanity, in this mythical world of Canberra, have they come up with the belief that Tamworth is an alpine area?</span>

When you move into a newly built suburb, you expect to have access to decent connectivity. But this hasn't been the experience of residents in The Ponds in my electorate. Households have been frustrated with poor mobile coverage since the suburb was built close to a decade ago. Too many residents are unable to make calls from their homes, instead forced to go outside into the street to make a call, or even to the next suburb along. And calls that do connect often continually drop out. As their local member, I've made it a priority to drive a practical solution to improve coverage for the good people of The Ponds. Our concerted community advocacy led to the construction of a new mobile tower. Optus and Telstra have since switched on their signals and the data shows it's being used by more than 3,000 customers in the area. We've been working to bring Vodafone-TPG to the table so their customers can also get the connectivity they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, despite the new tower, we are still hearing that mobile coverage issues persist. It's my priority to work for my constituents and follow up on their concerns, and this is a most pressing one. My team and I were out in The Ponds last weekend to find out more about people's experiences. The initial feedback shows that, while mobile phone reception is improving for some, the experience is not shared. This is not good enough. To the local residents of The Ponds: I want to hear from you. I've launched an online survey asking for you to share your coverage experiences over the last few months, since the tower was constructed. Your experiences will help me better understand where coverage is at its worst and fight for our community. The good people of The Ponds deserve access to reliable mobile coverage. It's not a 'nice to have'; it's a necessity, and one that I will continue to fight for—for you and your family. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  Just last week I attended the Forum on Western Sydney Airport meeting and received an update regarding submissions into the draft EIS—the impact statement for flight path design. There have been immense contributions from many communities across Western Sydney, with over 8,000 submissions sent to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts. I know there are a huge number of submissions from my electorate of Lindsay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I put in a submission myself, and I want to highlight some of my recommendations, which were very much based on my community's feedback. With regard to the flight paths, they need to be more evenly distributed across communities. All homes of equal noise impact should receive the same amount of noise mitigation if they meet the required decibel levels. More investigation is required into the impacts on property values and communication of these impacts needs to occur with the community. I've always been concerned about the consultation process. I think further consultation should be provided to my community of Lindsay, particularly, especially those who are significantly impacted, to ensure that residents understand the complex flight path information. We have had only three or four community feedback sessions out of the 50-odd sessions that have occurred, so my community is only just coming on board with understanding the impacts of the flight paths of this major international airport. We certainly need more time to absorb the very complex information. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a number of key issues in the submissions, across the board. These include: a lack of consultation; noise, which for many communities will impact on property values; the social impacts on health and residents' quality of sleep; as well as mental health and environmental concerns. There's still a lot of work to be done when it comes to flight path design. I hope that the government is taking on board all of the 8,000-odd submissions; there are some key themes underlying those submissions. Everyone deserves to have their say. I really hope that the process, from here on in, is a lot more consultative and that the people's voices of Western Sydney are very much heard and we are not forgotten about. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I had the great pleasure, on the weekend, of attending two great local events in my electorate of Macarthur, with the Camden Show and the Ingleburn Alive festival providing family-friendly outdoor community festival offerings for locals and local businesses. The Camden Show—to which I've been a sponsor for 40 years—was first held in March 1886. It's come a long way since then. As it says on the show bag, it's 'still a country show'. This was evident on Saturday, with a range of livestock, produce, lucerne, a huge award-winning pumpkin, farming machinery and local agricultural companies as well. There was a modern twist, of course, with show bags, school dance shows and fire truck exhibitions et cetera, and it was great to be there. It was great to be there with my friend Professor Brad Frankum, who, as well as being a very well renowned immunologist, is an international-class show jumper, and he was competing in the show jumping, which was great to see. I had the pleasure of engaging with constituents; talking with local members, like the wonderful member for Camden, Sally Quinnell; and having a really great time. My kids have enjoyed it for many years. I love the Camden Show and I want it to continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also went to Ingleburn Alive festival, and it was great to see local businesses and local charities, such as the Salvation Army, the Camden Historical Society and the Lions Clubs for both Camden and Ingleburn, at the festival and showing their wares. It was great to support the member for Macquarie Fields, the Minister for Corrections and minister for consumer affairs, Anoulack Chanthivong, at Ingleburn Alive. It was great to see him there with some of my local constituents. Many of the kids that I saw as patients have now grown up, with their own families, particularly in Ingleburn and Camden. It was great to see them. It was great to be there in Camden with Mayor Ashleigh Cagney and her team at Camden Council, because they're doing great work in one of the most rapidly developing areas in the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we're rapidly becoming urbanised, it is still a country show. We still have agriculture in my community, and long may it continue. I really enjoyed the event and I really enjoyed seeing the people. I think it is amazing that, in a place like Macarthur that has had this rapid development, we have people from all around the world now, in what was once a very Anglo-Celtic community, and they were having a good time and enjoying what we have to offer locally. I want it to continue forever. I had a great time. My kids enjoy it now as adults with their children, and the local community really loves the Camden Show and Ingleburn Alive. Our councils have done a great job promoting both festivals for our whole local community, including all the new arrivals, and it was great to see them all there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  Housing affordability is marked by three measures: rents, the ability to save for a deposit, and the ability to service a mortgage and ultimately pay it off. On all three measures, Australians are struggling, and Sydneysiders are struggling more so than anywhere else. Since the onset of the pandemic, rents have increased by 28 per cent and, in the year to October 2023, rents increased by 8.1 per cent. At the same time, housing prices continue to rise, which means housing deposits continue to rise also, and I see this in my electorate with record house prices in many suburbs, despite a dozen interest rate rises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently in Sydney, it takes almost 10 years to save for a deposit for an apartment and over 15 years to save for a house deposit. It's why the coalition's policy to allow young people to access their superannuation for savings is vital. Of course, if you finally bridge the gap for a deposit, the cost of a mortgage keeps going up and up. In 2020, nationwide servicing of an average new mortgage for a home required 30.3 per cent of your income. By October last year, that had risen to 49.5 per cent. In Sydney, that amount is 72.2 per cent. In other words, if you live in Sydney and you're on an average income and want to live in an average house, then it will require $3 in every $4 you earn. That's impossible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two things we must do. Firstly, we must temper population growth. Sydney's housing is not keeping pace with the number of new arrivals. I'm an enthusiastic supporter of migration and a multicultural Australia, but, in 2022-2023, net overseas migration contributed 174,000 people to New South Wales, the bulk of them in Sydney. So demand is too strong, and the housing market's out of kilter. Secondly, we must responsibly increase the housing supply. It's a social and economic necessity, but it must be done in a way that works with local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm deeply concerned about the new planning regime that's been put in place by the Minns Labor government. They want to remove the say that local communities have on how we increase housing supply. I believe community inputs will always make developments better. The Minns Labor government's top-down approach to densities will strip local communities of their autonomy. We see the start of this decision to override local planning controls in areas around 31 metro and rail stations, including many on the North Shore, as well as councils being bullied on densities and issues such as dual occupancy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support more housing, I support sensible local housing targets and I support investments in local infrastructure, but it all must be done in partnership with local communities. The state government needs to work with local communities, like the Hornsby and the Hills shire councils in my electorate that have taken a responsible approach to meeting the density requirements asked of them by a succession of state governments. Our housing challenges are too complex for one level of government to go it alone. We all must work in partnership in tackling this vital challenge—for the future of our city, our state and our country.</span>

I am especially proud that the Albanese government's Schools Upgrade Fund is investing over $200,000 in projects in my electorate of Brand, right across the schools in Rockingham and Kwinana. This funding will ensure that schools in my electorate are properly equipped to provide the best possible learning environments for all students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight some of these exciting upgrades that are underway or in fact completed. The Port Kennedy Primary School will receive new IT equipment, enhancing digital learning opportunities for students. St Vincent's primary school in Kwinana will get a new outdoor playground, providing a safe space for children to play and learn in the great outdoors. Charthouse Primary School in Waikiki are having their air-conditioning and ventilation systems upgraded, and funding will also provide for necessary maintenance and make for a more comfortable learning environment. The Peel Language Development School in Rockingham Lakes will get new outdoor learning spaces and shade structures. Rivergums Primary School and Tuart Rise Primary School in Baldivis, Rockingham Senior High School Education Support Centre, Waikiki Primary School and Warnbro Community High School Education Support Centre are all receiving shade structure installations or upgrades to provide important sun-safe areas for students. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These projects are essential investments in the future of children and students right across the growing suburbs of Brand. This is $200,000 of real money that will go directly to supporting the projects that schools need and that schools want to make sure they have environments where all of the students can learn and thrive and grow, and that is what Labor governments are all about supporting. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently my husband, Jamie, and I had the privilege of attending a fantastic event in my electorate, the Thaipusam Chariot Festival at the Perth Bala Murugan Hindu temple in Mandogalup, an absolutely magnificent event. It is a Tamil Hindu festival celebrated on the first full-moon day of the Tamil month of Thai. It is one of the temple's largest events and included an incredible chariot procession that went around the perimeter of the temple—great fun and an honour to celebrate with festival-goers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's wonderful to have the Bala Murugan Hindu temple in my electorate. It's a really welcoming facility catering to the Hindu community in Rockingham and Kwinana, and the Hindu community right across the whole of Perth. The Labor government is supporting the temple through its Securing Faith-Based Places program because this government is committed to ensuring that people of all faiths in Australia can live and practise their faith free from violence and discrimination. This funding will help the Mandogalup Hindu temple to upgrade its security and infrastructure to make sure everyone can enjoy their faith in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  I rise to speak on behalf of approximately 400 small businesses across Australia who support well over 19,000 Australians with employment and contribute a whopping $2.4 billion to our national GDP. I speak of the firearms industry. These small businesses service more than 868,000 licensed firearm owners: Aussie farmers; sporting shooters, including gold medallists; and recreational hunters, who remove pests and abundant species from our landscape. They are lawful Australian businesses which are heavily regulated, and rightly so, but I'm standing to speak of the unnecessary, unlawful discrimination against licensed firearm traders from our banking and financial sector, as well as from social media providers. Far too many small businesses in the firearms industry are encountering obstacles in securing basic financial services and using online platforms.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial institutions such as banks, EFTPOS and buy-now pay-later providers play a pivotal role in business transactions today, and it's worth pointing out that, quite often, firearms businesses in remote, rural and regional areas are combined with other services. For example, a firearms dealer might also have a service mix that includes providing essential services like fuel, mechanical repairs, agricultural necessities et cetera. So the decision to decline financial services to a small business for ill-considered reasons robs that rural and regional community of these essential services. As I mentioned, it's not just financial services that are being denied to these businesses. Social media platforms, which have become all but essential to any business in this day and age, have also thrown up barriers to these businesses, thereby exacerbating the issues faced by firearms dealers who operate as small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regulation of the firearms industry is the role of government. Further requirements on these legitimate, lawful businesses actually undermine the efforts of government in this matter. Firearms businesses are operating under strict, stringent legislation and oversight. It's not a role for banks, payment providers, services or social media platforms to impose their own conditions above those that government imposes. Businesses within the firearm industry have the right to operate, promote and grow their business using financial services and social media platforms like anyone else operating within the law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's about time, quite frankly, that banks in particular started focusing more on their social responsibility, particularly to their rural and regional customers, by keeping branches open, rather than denying rural and regional businesses based on their corporate and social responsibility policies which overstep the bank's role in society. It's blatant discrimination, and I stand here with the industry and its customers in calling it out.</span>

Often, these are people who have never previously had to rely on charity to get by. According to Foodbank, Australia's largest charity food provider, 3.7 million households ran out of food in the last year. Foodbank's website states that, last year alone, it sourced enough food for over 92 million meals.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I therefore noted with interest the 2023 Salvation Army annual report, which highlighted the extraordinary level of community services provided across Australia by the Salvos. Those services included the provision of nearly $25 million of financial assistance, 1.2 million nights of accommodation, 1.63 million meals to people who accessed homelessness services, nearly 820,000 crisis beds to people who experienced homelessness, housing for 3,000-plus people, $8.3 million of financial assistance to those impacted by a disaster and assistance to 12,000-plus people with addiction. These services are in addition to regular church services—</span>

                  </a>  I was saying just before the division that these services are in addition to the regular church services, funerals, aged-care accommodation and financial counselling that's provided by the Salvos. As a visitor to the Salvation Army centres in my region, I see firsthand the many and valuable community services that all of those centres provide.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, of course, other not-for-profit organisations that are similarly helping individuals and whole families make ends meet by providing food, clothing and even cash to pay household utility bills or for other essential needs. Time doesn't permit me to acknowledge them all today, but only last week I attended the reopening of the upgraded Pathway Community Centre at Modbury North. The centre operates as an arm of the Clovercrest Baptist Church led by Pastor Mike Stevens. For years, it has provided food parcels, clothing, and financial counselling to people in need. The recent stage 1 upgrade was a direct response to the growing need for its services, with the centre now providing around 140 food parcels per day. Further upgrades to the centre are in the pipeline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pathway Community Centre partners with other groups, churches and schools to distribute food beyond the store front and relies heavily on a band of committed volunteers. I want to give my sincere thanks to both the Salvos and the Pathway Community Centre teams for making a difference to people's lives. I often ask myself this question: what would we do without them and all of the other welfare charity groups?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr KHALIL:</span>
                    </a>  Fair enough. I withdraw. Thank you, Member for Solomon. The Albanese government is taking decisive action to bolster Australia's national security by ensuring our military secrets remain safe. Australian security organisations have long known that the biggest national security threats faced by Australia are from sophisticated foreign actors. We face such threats not just in physical spaces and in the seas or in the skies but also on a personnel-to-personnel level. Foreign intelligence services seek to penetrate not just our borders but also the space and time that bounds our information, our knowledge and our technologies. They do this by trying to involve themselves in government, military, academia and business to obtain classified information and understand military capabilities, policy plans and sensitive research and innovation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In February 2023, the ASIO director-general, Mike Burgess, observed that third-party companies have offered Australians hundreds of thousands of dollars and other significant perks to help authoritarian regimes improve their combat skills. The Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill comes in response to a string of such reports and concerns. While in some cases our defence and intelligence agencies have been able to prevent former personnel from travelling overseas, there is an overall and bipartisan, I would hope, agreement that this legislation is a necessary and pertinent response to many of the issues that we have seen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The safeguarding Australia's military secrets amendment—the SAMS—will strengthen Australia's existing legislative provisions to control and prevent the export and transfer of sensitive defence information to foreign militaries. It achieves this by creating an authorisation framework that regulates work performed by former Defence staff members, including both former ADF members and Defence Australian Public Service employees. This means that former Defence staff members categorised as foreign-work-restricted individuals are prohibited from working for foreign military or government bodies unless authorised. This will include ADF service chiefs as well as the chief and the vice chief. It will include permanent reserve force members of the ADF who provide continuous full-time service, the secretary of the Department of Defence and the head of the new Australian Submarine Agency, as well as all the civilian APS employees of the above.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These staff members will, on passage of this bill, be classified as foreign-work-restricted individuals and be subject to new restrictions from providing their services and training to relevant foreign countries and organisations. Relevant foreign countries will include all foreign countries unless exempt by the minister's determination. Beyond Defence staff members, Australian citizens and permanent residents will be restricted from providing certain types of training without authorisation, with criminal penalties for noncompliance. This includes Australian citizens or permanent residents seeking to provide training to foreign militaries or foreign government entities in relation to goods, software and technology in part 1 of the Defence and Strategic Goods List, or trading in relation to military tactics, techniques or procedures. It will become a criminal offence for foreign-work-restricted individuals to work for foreign military or government bodies without authorisation, carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. Exceptions to this offence include holding a foreign work authorisation, performing work under a Commonwealth agreement or engaging in specific authorised activities such as humanitarian aid or UN-related duties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to emphasise that the SAMS bill adopts a commonsense approach to regulating how former defence personnel with sensitive information provide services and training with non-friendly foreign governments. The bill contains sensible and targeted actions that will enhance the government's ability to prevent the unwanted transfer of sensitive defence information to those foreign militaries. The provisions are restricted only to those individuals with knowledge of Australia's world-class defence training in military technology who are engaging in activities that would harm Australia's national security. I also want to highlight that the bill is bigger than just dealing with this issue in Australia. The passage of this legislation will also align our legal framework with those of our partners within the AUKUS security partnership. In the UK the National Security Act 2023, which was enacted in July last year, made it an offence to obtain or disclose protected information, which includes tactics, techniques and procedures, after receiving similar reports of pilots training for foreign governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that Australia's national security policies align and are being aligned with our most important partners as we work together on all the challenges that we jointly face. In addition, this bill will be complemented by legislative reform efforts currently underway to strengthen Australia's export control framework. SAMS complements the Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill 2023 to further strengthen Australia's export control framework by enhancing the protections around the supply of controlled goods and technology within and outside Australia. The SAMS bill also supports the export-licence-free environment between AUKUS partners, unlocking defence trade innovation and collaboration. Together with the Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill, the SAMS bill will meet the requirement to implement a standard of controls comparable to those of the United States to access the national exemption from US export control licensing requirements under the US Arms Export Control Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Strengthening Australia's export control framework will not only protect Australia's defence industry and the knowledge and capability there; in combination with this bill, it will also help facilitate passage of the United States legislation by ensuring that Australia's export control framework is aligned with US export controls. Australian export control reforms are essential to creating a stronger national defence industry. That base is so important because it's the foundation of the collaboration we're undertaking with our AUKUS partners at the required speed and scale to meet Australia's challenging strategic circumstances and to support our international partners. These combined legislative reforms also open up significant benefits and opportunities for the Australian industry, higher education and research sectors. They are important steps towards establishing seamless technological transfers with our AUKUS partners. Together, the two bills demonstrate Australia's commitment to safeguarding sensitive technology and information shared with the US and the UK through and within AUKUS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, the Minister for Defence and the department are all acutely aware that the measures in this bill can be complex and serious. The drafting of the bill has come after extensive consultation with all the interested and important stakeholders, including the defence industry sector, academia, veterans groups and unions representing many current or former Defence personnel. We are of the firm belief that the Department of Defence will be able to efficiently implement the foreign work authorisation system, including the processing of requests. The bill has also been reviewed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which I chair, and by representatives from across the House and Senate. It has been amended in line with some of the committee's recommendations. After an extensive inquiry and review process, the bill has been recommended for passing by the PJCIS as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The protection of our nation's secrets and sensitive information is central to preserving Australia's national security and to keeping Australians safe. If I ever had the privilege of flying one of those great planes that the RAAF has—and that is a great privilege—it would also come with the obligation to protect the knowledge and the military secrets that have been gained on those from falling into the hands of any adversaries. I want to acknowledge that we have veterans here in this place; the member for Solomon and the member for Herbert have served in our military, in the ADF. They know the importance of the obligation and responsibility they have, given all that they have learned over their years of service, to protect that information, knowledge and capability from falling into the wrong hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In all seriousness, this is really what the Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill is meant to do. It is meant to make sure that, for those of us who have served, both in Defence, as I have, or in the military, as the member for Herbert, the member for Solomon and many other veterans have, when we go about our business in the private sector we can do so with the assurance and confidence that we have sought the right authorisation and are clear to go ahead and do the work that we are doing post our service in the military.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that vein, I am very, very pleased to extend my strong support for this bill, because it provides a commonsense but also necessary suite of measures to achieve this objective. It complements our defence export controls measures, it brings us into step with our AUKUS allies, it comes as a culmination of extensive consultations with relevant and impacted stakeholders and it comes at a time when the strategic theatres that we operate in and the threats that we face are becoming more and more asymmetrical and more and more difficult to identify. Those asymmetric threats warrant appropriate responses in this legislative framework as part of our response. We need those responses. We need transparent and clear responses. I am proud to say that this is the right approach to counter such threats on all fronts. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I want to take this opportunity to make a few comments on these two very important defence bills that we are considering today—the Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill 2023 and the Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill 2023. I would like to acknowledge my friend the member for Solomon and the member for Wills and his contribution just then and the importance of both of these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleague the member for Canning has already mentioned, the coalition will be supporting this legislation. The Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill 2023 is a critical path to a smooth implementation of the AUKUS security pact, ensuring that we have the seamless transfer of technology that we and our partners need to enable it. The Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill 2023 is crucial to making sure that our foreign militaries and governments aren't given a leg up by somebody who knows the ADF from the inside. I will touch on the second one first and then come back to the trade controls bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill 2023 came about after concerning reports that a former RAAF fighter pilot may have provided training to Chinese pilots. The reports, quite rightly, triggered an investigation by the joint AFP-ASIO Counter Foreign Interference Taskforce and Defence, looking in part at how the department managed security clearances and other controls for people taking jobs after their military careers. Following the investigation, it was deemed that there was enough evidence to show that more work needed to be done to ensure that the system was rock solid. This bill today is the product of that work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The vast majority of our former defence members do the right thing. They sign up for service out of national pride and a determination to protect the sovereignty of our nation. They would never dream of sharing military secrets with a foreign military. But, for the extreme minority—a very small group—that might do the wrong thing, there must be absolutely no excuse, no reason and no allowance for that to happen. We are in the most challenging strategic circumstances since World War II. Members of our ADF are naturally targets of foreign intelligence services. ASIO Director-General Mike Burgess said in his February 2023 threat assessment:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Third party companies have offered Australians hundreds of thousands of dollars and other significant perks to help authoritarian regimes improve their combat skills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In some cases, we and our partners have been able to stop the former insiders travelling overseas to provide the training, but in others, legal ambiguities have impeded law enforcement's ability to intervene.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However the individuals rationalise their decisions, the bottom line is they are transferring highly sensitive, privileged and classified know-how to foreign governments that do not share our values or respect the rule of law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our military secrets are not for sale. That's why former defence staff and ADF members must be prevented from working for and transferring sensitive information to foreign militaries, governments or government entities without authorisation from the Minister for Defence. It's why this must also extend to Australian citizens and permanent residents. There must be a strong deterrent, and, where a person undertakes these activities without authorisation, the maximum penalty is 20 years in prison. We must support the intentions of this legislation to safeguard our national and military secrets, and the coalition will work on a bipartisan basis with the government in the best interests of Australia's national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we need to have some exemptions, and it's important that the minister have the power to make those exemptions to enable cooperation with our security partners. Under this legislation, the minister may grant a foreign work authorisation, cancel an authorisation, suspend an authorisation or vary an authorisation. The minister can also determine a foreign country is not a relevant foreign country, meaning it is not necessary to obtain a foreign work authorisation to work or train there. This means that former members, now veterans, who have critical skills, knowledge and abilities that may be used in a low-risk setting or one of our partners can still work overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the minister must ensure is that there aren't significant delays in processing requests for foreign work authorisations in those relevant foreign countries. We know how difficult it is already for veterans who leave to figure out where they want to take their lives after service. Sometimes, that means a job overseas in a position that matches some or all of their skills and abilities. I and the member for Solomon both worked overseas post our defence careers. I think we both worked in the Middle East for different organisations. We want to be able to ensure that streamlining of any authorisations is quick, because contracts come up quickly, and we don't want people to be worse off because of any red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There must be absolutely enough time given to examine each case properly and in detail; that must be a priority. The minister must ensure the department has the resources to conduct those processes without us seeing large backlogs or any wait times. We also need to ensure our people—our ADF members and APS employees—are well aware of their obligations under this legislation when they leave their employment. Twenty years is an extremely significant penalty, and it needs to be. But those who could potentially face it must be educated and warned about it so that there is no ambiguity. No-one should be able to say that they didn't know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, on this bill, it is reassuring that the definition of 'defence staff' does not include Defence's external workforce, consultant contractors and outsourced service providers, as we know contractors are equal to nearly 50 per cent of Defence's APS workforce. The caveat is that they will still, of course, fall under the 'Australian citizens and permanent residents' definition. The coalition will support the Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets Bill in demonstration of our commitment on this side of the House to the safety and security of our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill 2023 is critical to strengthening Australia's defence exports framework and facilitates the seamless transfer of technology contemplated by the AUKUS agreement. To do this, we need to have a robust control regime and a streamlined flow of defence trade and technology collaboration with the UK and US. This will include the establishment of an export licence treaty environment, which will support industry, education and research sectors in all three nations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will regulate the supply of certain items on the Defence and Strategic Goods List, or DSGL, and military or dual-use technology to foreign persons within Australia. It will regulate the supply of certain DSGL military or dual-use goods and technology from a place outside of Australia to another place outside of Australia or to a foreign person. It will regulate the provision of services in relation to DSGL part 1 military goods or technology to foreign persons or entities. And it will remove the requirements to obtain a permit for suppliers of certain DSGL goods and technology and the provision of certain DSGL services to the United Kingdom or the United States.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are positive steps as we move forward with AUKUS and they are steps that will open up further opportunities for small and medium enterprises in Australia. We do want to see the defence minister's words—that Australia will achieve a 'seamless defence industrial base' between Australia and the US—come to fruition. But, at the same time, we need to ensure that industry isn't burdened with extra red tape and costs. I think it's important to note the submission of Ai Group to the exposure draft. They welcome the intent of these amendments and are excited about the licence-free environment with our AUKUS partners, but they are concerned about the impact of additional compliance costs and legal risks to their members and have asked for clear guidelines on the new measures as well as training programs to educate members about the new regulatory regime. We understand the government will propose a range of amendments to the DTCA Bill to address these concerns, and we welcome that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's true that there has been a fairly condensed amount of time provided for the consideration of these bills. We understand the time constraints in both the UK and the US that have required us to be dealing with these matters this sitting fortnight, and so, as I've said, we will be supporting passage of this legislation through the House. But, as a result, it is important that we have safeguards and points of review to ensure this legislation is operating as it should. That's why the coalition's support has been provided on the basis of enhancing the co-design of regulations for the defence export framework, with the participation of recommended industry working groups in representing Australian sovereign SMEs and a statutory review time frame of three years from commencement to evaluate the functioning of the updated defence export legislation and framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, and probably most importantly, we have a commitment from the Deputy Prime Minister to establish a new statutory parliamentary joint committee on defence as soon as possible. This will be a committee that can have proper oversight of defence matters, including the ADF and the Department of Defence, with access to classified information. Without it, parliament can't exercise proper civilian oversight of our military and defence public servants. It has been a long process to get to this point, but it is good that we have secured a commitment that draft legislation to enable it will be available within weeks, not months. With those assurances in mind, I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  From the outset, as the Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill 2023 is about safeguarding our military secrets, I will acknowledge the presence in the chamber and the service of the members for Menzies and Herbert. I also acknowledge the member for Wills, the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and the member for Fisher, the deputy chair, for their diligent work on the SAMS inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is taking decisive action to bolster Australia's national security by ensuring that our military secrets remain safe. Keeping our secrets in Australian hands is essential to preserving our national security and maintaining the trust of our like-minded security alliance and other partners. While this SAMS bill does not represent the entirety of our legislative ambition in this respect—for example, there are some issues that were identified through the PJCIS inquiry that will be addressed at other times and in other ways—it is an important step towards establishing more seamless tech transfers with our AUKUS partners. I'm very proud to have started, with the member for Casey, the Parliamentary Friends of AUKUS, and we are working hard to make sure that this arrangement is better understood, in the interests of all countries involved, with the ability for like-minded countries to keep the world open and fair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia already has a range of robust legislative measures and policies in place to deter and respond to the risk of foreign collection of our defence secrets; I think it's important to state that upfront. It's not as if our government or the former government have just worked out that we need to extend measures, but this bill does exactly that; it extends the measures that already exist. We protect our sensitive defence information, including through relevant offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995 and secrecy provisions. Australians who work, or have worked, in defence who come into possession of the nation's secrets have an obligation to maintain those secrets beyond their employment with the Commonwealth. The Criminal Code, for instance, contains general secrecy offences that apply to current and former Commonwealth officers, including ADF personnel, who harm the national interest by disclosing the information entrusted to them, and the code specifically prohibits the provision of military-style training involving a foreign government principal. This is an enduring obligation; to reveal any of those secrets is already a crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill extends Australia's already robust legislation and policies further, strengthening Australia's existing laws by protecting the export and transfer of sensitive defence information to foreign militaries. It will create a new framework, which will require certain individuals to seek authority to perform, work for or train with foreign militaries. It's about protecting our knowledge, skills and experience as well as regulating the military training that Australians may provide to foreign countries. The legislation delivers on the Deputy Prime Minister's commitment to strengthen Australia's legislation, following the investigation he instigated into reports that ex-ADF-personnel were being approached to provide military training to foreign countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These sensible reforms will be confined to only those individuals with knowledge of Australia's world-class defence training and military technology who are engaging in activities that would harm Australia's national security. This includes former defence staff members—both Australian Defence Force members and APS members—seeking to perform work for or on behalf of foreign militaries, and Australian citizens and permanent residents seeking to provide training to foreign militaries in relation to items in part 1 of the Defence and Strategic Goods List or in relation to military tactics, techniques and procedures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's sensible, decisive and timely approach is in stark contrast to the former coalition government's, who were warned about this security issue two years ago and did nothing to address it. I'm sure those on the other side will have an opportunity to speak to that. I have it on good authority that the then Minister for Defence and now opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was warned in mid-2021 about alleged attempts to recruit former ADF personnel to train China's military. The opposition leader clearly didn't act on these warnings and did nothing to address the issue, even though it was widely known about as far as I am aware.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation also bring us into line with the approach taken by our like-minded partners to protecting their own military secrets, and this includes a greater alignment with the US approach under its International Traffic in Arms Regulations; people may have heard that referred to as ITARS. These important reforms are also needed to ensure we have the necessary safeguards in place to unlock the potential of AUKUS and the benefits it brings to Australia.</span>

                    </a>  There are also other exceptions to the offences created by this bill. They include if an individual's work or training is in relation to providing aid of a humanitarian nature or if the individual performs an official duty for the United Nations, an agency of the United Nations or the International Committee of the Red Cross. An exemption also covers work or training in the course of an individual's employment or engagement by the Commonwealth. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will enable the Minister for Defence to determine, by legislative instrument, which countries are not to be regarded as relevant foreign countries under this framework. That means that, if an individual intends to work or provide training to a foreign country listed on the instrument, the individual would not be required to apply for an authorisation. This bill will also enable the Minister for Defence to determine, by legislative instrument, a class of former defence staff members who are not required to apply for an authorisation. The class may be determined by the type of work previously performed by that member and the period of time that has elapsed since the performance of that work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This authorisation framework is not intended to prevent Australians from working overseas or with foreign governments or militaries. Rather, our legislative intent is to prevent individuals with knowledge of sensitive defence information from training or working for certain foreign militaries or governments where that activity would put Australia's national security at risk. This bill will ensure individuals in possession of sensitive defence information who want to undertake these activities must first seek authorisation to do so. This is to ensure their activities are not damaging Australia's national interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in this bill are serious and vital, and that is why the bill was the subject of an inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which I am a member of. The committee agreed with the need for these reforms and noted the importance of the passage of this bill in providing AUKUS partners with an assurance of Australia's commitment to the security of military secrets. Throughout the inquiry process, the committee heard that most submitters were supportive of the need for the bill. Our bipartisan report recommended that the bill be passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important piece of legislation that will keep our country safe by preventing potential threat actors from leveraging former ADF members' classified knowledge of tactics, techniques and procedures. Defence members know that their nation entrusts them with the high honour of safeguarding our Commonwealth's most sensitive secrets. Veterans are the lifelong guardians of these secrets, even after they separate from the Australian Defence Force, and this bill will make it easier for all members and veterans to know how to safely manage their classified knowledge. No-one who does the right thing will be adversely affected, and the right thing will be to apply for authorisation if an opportunity comes up to work with a foreign military. It isn't a ban on such contracts, though there is a requirement to seek authorisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a deep and vital interoperability with the armed forces of our closest allies. For example, our Australian submariners are currently training in the US Nuclear Power School to prepare the way for our acquisition of nuclear powered submarines, and that won't be constrained by the bill. What the bill does is create a straightforward process that will ensure that ADF members and veterans have a clear sense of their left and right of arcs and their responsibility as guardians of our nation's secrets, both in and out of uniform. It's a crucial piece of legislation, and I commend it to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  I rise in support of this cognate debate in relation to the Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill and the Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill. After doing a little bit of research, I discovered that the genesis of the safeguarding Australia's military secrets bill goes back more than a hundred years, probably much further than that. I would hazard a guess that protecting one's military secrets goes back as far as the military profession itself. In what is now known as the Sempill Mission, which dates back to the 1920s, British aviators trained Imperial Japanese Army aviators on how to conduct naval warfare on aircraft carriers. That instruction of Japanese aviators obviously had a very significant empowering impact upon the Imperial Japanese Navy, which led to the Pearl Harbor attacks on 7 December 1941. So it's very important that we learn the lessons from that unfortunate incident.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first we heard of a modern day version of such an incident was back in October 2022, when it was alleged that some 30 Royal Air Force pilots were conducting training for the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force. That sent shockwaves throughout the Western world. It wasn't just RAF pilots; it was also Royal Navy pilots and Royal Army pilots training Chinese pilots. I want to take issue with a comment in which the member for Solomon indicated that this dates back to a time when the current Leader of the Opposition was the defence minister. At the very earliest, the first time this was made public in England was in October 2022. I am disappointed that the member for Solomon has tried to besmirch the opposition leader on that point, but I digress a little bit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The SAMS bill, as I'll call it, came before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and was treated with some haste. That is something that I, as the deputy chair of the PJCIS, do not like doing. I don't like conducting business in a hasty fashion—pardon the pun—because rushed legislation often leads to errors, unforeseen circumstances and unforeseen problems. But in this case both the SAMS bill and the Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill need to be rushed through the Australian parliament to be done and dusted by the end of March. Why? There are pressing matters that require us to pass this legislation to satisfy US and UK legislation. They have passed legislation, through both the UK parliament and the US Congress, which effectively requires us, as part of the AUKUS arrangement, to get these bills through expeditiously. As I say, it's not something that we like doing, but it's something that we needed to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you may have gathered from my initial comments about the SAMS bill, it is incredibly important that we protect the training, tactics and techniques of the Australian Defence Force. That isn't just restricted to pilots. There are many tactics, techniques and procedures of numerous roles within the ADF that we would not want passed on to adversaries, whether it be those of our special forces in the Army, submariners in the Navy or fighter pilots in the Air Force. So we need to ensure that our legislation properly equips the Australian government to prevent that exchange of information to foreign governments and militaries. It is as old as the history or the profession of a soldier to re-engineer how an adversary does something—to try and improve upon it yourself—and that's why we need to be very careful that we don't arm our adversaries with that vital information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge at this stage the great work that was done by former prime minister Scott Morrison, the former defence minister and now Leader of the Opposition, and Senator Reynolds in putting and stitching the AUKUS deal together, because we would not be here talking about these two bills but for AUKUS. AUKUS provides an avenue for us to be able to secure the crown jewels of defence—namely, the nuclear propulsion of a submarine, which has not been provided to any other country other than the UK since the 1950s. So that nuclear propulsion technology is regarded as the crown jewels, and there are many countries that would love to be able to get information about how that propulsion is designed and operated. That's just to put that into context—we would not be here today talking about these two bills but for the AUKUS deal landed by the former prime minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a some $270 billion program that will set Australia up with very significant defensive capabilities, and these nuclear propelled submarines give us the competitive edge that we may need. Hopefully, we'll never need it. No-one wants to enter a conflict, but, if we are to deter our adversaries from starting a conflict, this is how we do it. We ensure that our men and women of the ADF have the appropriate tools, skills and equipment to deter aggression by our competitors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The SAMS bill does not outlaw a former ADF member going and working overseas. What it does do is require that former ADF member, or an Australian citizen or resident, to get an authorisation from the defence minister to enable them to go and work overseas. That should not be considered to be an extraordinary thing. There will be an opportunity for the defence minister to carve certain countries out by regulatory instrument—you might think, ultimately, that will be Five Eyes countries—and there will be instances where certain professions within the ADF might also be carved out by instrument. No-one's suggesting that a cook might provide certain information to an adversary that would be deleterious—unless you're Steven Seagal, of course! I will look at the defence boffins and see if they know who Steven Seagal is. It's probably an age thing. But I digress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The SAMS bill will enable Australian former ADF members to be able to work overseas and work with foreign militaries and governments provided they get the appropriate authorisation from the defence minister. There will be a number of exemptions that will be provided. There will be certain things that the defence minister or the department will look at—namely, how long it has been since person has been in a particular role. It may be the case that, in some instances, it doesn't matter how long you have been out of the ADF you will not get an authorisation to, for instance, work for or in China. Submariners would come to mind as a trade or a profession where we wouldn't want that knowledge passed on. But for someone who perhaps worked in signals 10 or 15 years ago that may be something where we would regard those skills as having expired or the value of which expires over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill itself is very commendable. The PJCIS committee examined the bill. We made a number of recommendations to the government. I am hopeful that the government has accepted those recommendations, because it's very common for a government to accept the recommendations of the PJCIS. One of them in particular was this. When the bill came before the committee, it made no reference to banning a former ADF member from providing services to a militia. We all know that in some cases it's very hard to tell the difference between a government military, or a military that is the tool of a sovereign government, and militia forces. So the committee recommended that the bill be amended to reflect that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The urgency for these bills, as I indicated earlier, is that the government has indicated that, since the United States Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act in December 2023, the timetable for passing these bills needs to be accelerated. Australia cannot be left behind in relation to AUKUS. This is an arrangement that benefits not just Australia; it is an arrangement through which we will, through the other pillars, have a mutually beneficial arrangement. I think we are kidding ourselves if we don't understand that AUKUS is a huge win for the Australian people, because that is exactly what it is. We don't want to be in a position where Australia holds things up. If the US Congress and the UK parliament have done what they need to do, we don't want to be the laggard. Indeed, the NDAA requires the US Congress, with the certification of the US president, to be satisfied with Australia's progress in implementing security and export frameworks within 120 days of the NDAA's enactment. The first certification date is 20 April 2024. That is in less than one month. So naturally the government seeks to expedite the passage of the SAMS and the DTCA through both chambers by the end of the March sitting fortnight. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to say, if there are any members from the defence department in the chamber today, these bills—SAMS, in particular—will be scrutinised by the new defence committee. We don't want to see inordinate delays of authorisations. This is critical because small, medium and large businesses rely upon timely authorisations under this act. The new committee will scrutinise the defence department's expeditious handling of these authorisations very closely. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence, Assistant Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Assistant Minister for the Republic</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  The Deputy Prime Minister referred the Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill 2023 to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for inquiry. I want to thank the PJCIS for its work on this bill, particularly given the fact that the committee has a number of inquiries ongoing at the moment. The committee ultimately recommended the bill be passed and made a number of other recommendations for which I will provide a response on behalf of the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to recommendation 1—to expand the exemption to the work authorisation requirement from the International Committee of the Red Cross to include the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement—the government agrees in principle. To ensure consistency with other legislation, particularly with the Criminal Code, which has certain defences and exemptions for the Red Cross, Defence has been directed to work with other departments to develop a common approach to addressing the issue, rather than through this bill alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to recommendation 2—that the government assess whether existing legislation and procedures sufficiently cover working or training for paramilitary organisations and militias—there is strong existing legislation to address these threats, and Defence will continue to work the Attorney-General's Department to monitor the adequacy of current legislation and procedures in relation to former defence personnel. In relation to recommendation 3—that the words 'that would prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia' be added in section 115B—the government considered this closely but does not agree with this recommendation. The provision in section 115B is appropriately targeted and narrow in its application.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, requiring a direct linkage between the transfer of military tactics, techniques and procedures related to information and the words 'prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia' would make it difficult to enforce the legislation. Military tactics, techniques and procedures information exists across a variety of classifications and formats, making it difficult to establish a traditional link between the classification or nature of information and the damage to national security. The result of this information being lost to foreign militaries may also take significant time to manifest, and it may not be until Australian defence forces are engaged in conflict that the impact of the knowledge transfer and its benefits to a foreign military are fully apparent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this bill is to enhance and extend the existing prohibitions on sharing military secrets. It seeks to ensure that those individuals with knowledge of sensitive defence information do not engage in work or training for foreign militaries, governments or entities that are damaging Australia's national security interests. I can assure the House that this will be reflected in the bill's implementing procedures, authorisation processes and enforcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to recommendation 4—that the government consider amending the bill to give the minister the power to allow for bulk application approvals for companies who already have defence export control arrangements approved—this would not be appropriate as, while a company may have defence export control authorisations, individual owners or employees will have an array of complex personnel circumstances which require a case-by-case assessment. Only by assessing each individual on a case-by-case basis is it possible to understand the harm that could be done to Australia's national security as a result of an individual undertaking work or training for a foreign military, government or entity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence will work to ensure the work authorisation process under this bill is as streamlined as possible and is responsive to critical business and personal priorities. The government understands the significant commercial and financial impact that delays in work authorisations could have and has directed Defence to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to process applications as expeditiously as possible while ensuring security arrangements and requirements are met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 5 is that the government assess our existing legislation, that procedures covering former national intelligence community officers and their work for foreign governments be strengthened and that we address the need for further legislation. Noting the critical role of these officers in protecting Australia's national security, Defence will work with relevant Commonwealth agencies to consider the committee's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for an inquiry and report. The government again thanks the committee for its work in conducting the inquiry, which ultimately recommended that the bill be passed without delay. In response to the matters raised by the Senate inquiry in its final report, and as part of the co-design process with stakeholders, I can foreshadow that the government will be moving amendments to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go through the government's response to those recommendations. In relation to recommendation 1—that the definition of 'fundamental research' be included in the bill itself and consideration be given to including additional exemptions in the bill where possible—the government agrees with this recommendation, and the amendments will be moved to address this. In relation to recommendation 2 on the definition of 'Australian persons' and its inconsistency with the United States' definition, the definition of 'Australian person' has been deliberately aligned with the definition of 'US person' in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government would also like to make it absolutely clear that, under Australian law, before any goods and services can be provided to an entity or individual on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Consolidated List—a list of all persons and entities listed under Australian sanctions laws—a sanctions permit from the Australian Sanctions Office is required. The amendments in this bill will not override or change this requirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to recommendation 3, Defence will continue to undertake consultation and engagement with impacted stakeholders, including industry and the higher education research sectors, through its established working groups. Defence is developing fact sheets for publication on the Defence website and dissemination to impacted sectors via peak bodies. The fact sheets will articulate the legislative changes, what they mean for regulated entities and individuals, next steps and where to obtain information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to recommendation 4, the government amendments to be moved are the product of co-design with industry. The government has directed Defence to continue the co-design process it has been undertaking through its established working groups for amendments to the subordinate regulations, instruments and definitions and in the implementation of this regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to recommendation 5, the government agrees it would be beneficial to expand the established working groups to include additional representation from relevant Australian defence small and medium enterprises. It has directed Defence to expand the membership of the working groups accordingly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to recommendation 6, the government agrees that a relevant parliamentary committee should review the implementation of the reforms within three years of commencement. This is in addition to the three-year independent review of the legislation the government has already committed to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to recommendation 7, the government agrees that Defence should be appropriately resourced to provide advice to external stakeholders, with this being appropriately publicised. Defence has already commenced work to upgrade the relevant ICT system to support new permit applications and expedited assessment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence is expanding and increasing its education and outreach program, including by developing online learning and education materials that stakeholders can use to support decision-making in relation to permit requirements and other education and guidance materials. The department also has a 1800 number for the public to call to seek assistance or advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to recommendation 8—that Defence Export Controls be adequately resourced to undertake its work as efficiently as possible—the government agrees that Defence should be appropriately resourced to support the implementation of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the Greens dissenting report, the government does not agree with that recommendation, and the government intends to pass the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I know that time is of the essence in passing and processing these bills, so in that spirit I flag that I won't be using my full time, for those who are preparing to come next.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important and fundamental factor in conflict is the will to fight, and that is because war and conflict are fundamentally a human endeavour. Humans are not computers or robots. We have emotions. We are part of groups, tribes, families, units, formations, divisions and nations. In that aspect, the will to fight is so fundamental. If executed properly it means—hopefully—we don't actually have to fight, and that's at the heart of AUKUS. AUKUS isn't about preparing this nation for an actual conflict. It is designed to prevent conflict. It is designed to get inside the heads of potential foes when they are war gaming and lead them to say 'not today'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As technology evolves, that question of 'not today' is one that has to continuously be asked, and one of the reasons it has to continuously be asked is that technology evolves. AUKUS is a huge, multigenerational, nation-building task in advancing our technology and equipment, and we can't do that if we don't have the mechanisms to protect the secrets that underpin it. But we must never forget that what we are doing here also affects the humans that we rely upon to take great risks and fight in our name. I acknowledge the member for Hunter here. I was in his electorate on Monday to say farewell to the former member for Hunter's son, Jack Fitzgibbon, someone who put on our uniform and was prepared to sacrifice his life—and lost his life—in the service of our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this nation we have 581,000 veterans, just under 60,000 full-time members of the Defence Force and 32,000 reserves. The SAMS part of the Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill puts an anvil over their heads and says, 'If you don't comply with certain requirements, you'll go from being a hero to a criminal.' That's an important but really serious thing that we should acknowledge. The headline offence in SAMS is 20 years in prison—20 years. What we're doing here is important, but we should do it conscious of the regime that we are imposing on current and future ADF members. I hope we never see a prosecution here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On many other occasions and in many other legislative instruments, particularly in criminal law, we might all furiously agree on what's intended to be captured here, but there will be a future department, a future Director of Public Prosecutions and a future AFP that will have to actually apply what we're passing here. I was given comfort that this doesn't appear to be an offence that is of absolute liability. It still has, on my reading of it, the defence of honest and reasonable mistake. That is a common-law defence that also exists in the Commonwealth Criminal Code, in section 9.2. That's fundamental because, again—and acknowledging the human in all of us—sometimes someone might miss the email, or they were sick when the brief was given, or they didn't fill the form in or they didn't pay their mobile bill and receive the confirmation of what they had asked for. Ignorance of the law is not a defence, but the defence of honest and reasonable mistake is more than that. The defence of 'honest and reasonable mistake' is really explained in the words. It's 'honest', and that honesty is subjective to the person who is potentially being accused; and it's 'reasonable'—in an objective standard, a reasonable person would accept that excuse. And I'm glad that defence exists here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fisher, quite rightly, said at the end of his address that we really need to make sure that the processing of these forms and the paperwork is done in a timely fashion, and I'll just give an example. Let's say someone has served for 10 years in the ADF and they want to apply to a consulting firm or a defence contractor, but that company or firm does engage in some capacity with a country or nation that has an ambiguity about whether this applies. To be on the safe side, their policy is to go get this approval. If that approval take eight, 12 or 18 months, that person won't get hired. Eventually, they won't get asked, and we'll have the scenario where, through delay, veterans won't be employed in areas that they're highly suitable for. That's why the defence committee which is going to have oversight of this is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the PJCIS and the corresponding defence committee for the work they do; I know there's a lot of work put on the committee and I thank those who have cooperated to push this forward. I'm grateful that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake is in here. I think that's important, and I urge, as the member for Fisher did, for the future defence committee's oversight of the implementation of this scheme. Our 581,000 veterans are heroes; anyone who signs up to be a member risks having their family stand next to their coffin, as the Fitzgibbons did on Monday. For that, we owe them an enormous debt of gratitude. To then say that some of them will become criminals with an offence that's liable for 20 years, we had better be sure that it's right. We had better be sure. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:57</span>):  I want to preface what I'm about to say on the Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill 2023 and the related bill by stating that I don't begin this speech with an ideological mindset against AUKUS. I well understand the arguments for it, particularly in the world in which we live today. On that basis I welcome the opportunity to speak on these bills because I think that, as a nation, we need to have this conversation. I will say this: for a project with the eye-watering price tag of $368 billion, we are asked to accept an awful lot about AUKUS as an act of faith—that Pillar II of AUKUS, the subject of this legislation, in effect, will provide the benefits to Australian research and industry predicted by the government; that the US can reboot its industrial base sufficiently to build the submarines promised to Australia; that the US Congress will agree to the sale of two or three of its own subs to Australia as the US struggles to build new subs at a rate to match its own strategic priorities; that Australia has not implicitly undermined national sovereignty in signing up for AUKUS; that the US Congress will agree to sell Australia the first two or three subs without an express commitment to join Washington in conflict with China over Taiwan; that Australia can develop the workforce with the expertise required to develop a nuclear submarine from scratch in the short time frame required; that a small force of nuclear submarines could do what a larger and cheaper force of conventional submarines could not; and that a handful of expensive nuclear subs will prove to be a deterrent, protecting Australia's vital shipping lanes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former prime minister Scott Morrison is also a former marketing man. In keeping with that, the big question about AUKUS has always been whether there's less to this megaproject than meets the eye—that it's more about marketing than delivery, and that goes for Pillar II as well as for the subs themselves. I've met officials, for example, from an Australian defence technology company whose cutting-edge technology has been sought by a major US defence contractor, but the Australian company can't get its foot in the door because of current American restrictions. In theory, one of these bills at least is designed to address that constraint, but there are concerns that it could make it worse by creating a rigid two-way market which the US has outsized power over, while preventing such companies from doing their business with other countries. In short, to get a piece of AUKUS Pillar II, Australian companies will have to sign up to incredibly rigid restrictions and then hope the Americans give them the contracts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also fears in industry that the history of our own defence department is such that even with these new provisions in place, in general it's more content to buy stuff from overseas, and the US in particular, than in encouraging the development of a sovereign Australian defence capability. A cynic might say that the surprise AUKUS announcement at 7 am on 15 September 2021 was more about wedging Labor and escaping the increasingly embarrassing questions about the viability of the troubled French submarine project than about the long-term consequences in terms of cost and strategic effectiveness. Greg Sheridan is no China dove, quite the opposite in fact, but in the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Australian</span> late last year he wrote this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the government, the AUKUS subs are a magic pudding, so far away you don't have to spend any more money on them, and so impressive sounding they convince people you are doing something on defence when you are doing nothing. And if a few lefties complain, all the better, but it still produces no defence capability over the next 10 years and quite possibly nothing after that either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sheridan is not alone. Michael Shoebridge is the former director of ASPI's Defence, Strategy and National Security program. Last November he wrote this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In a different world, where Defence was meeting its core obligations to provide cogent, well-founded advice to support government decision making, we would expect that there had been a proper analysis of alternative ways of increasing Australia's deterrent capabilities and long range strike against the backdrop of a dangerous region centred on an aggressive China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But it is almost certain that this did not happen in the lead up to the AUKUS announcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No wonder doubts persist, not just about the financial wisdom but also the strategic wisdom to the AUKUS initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hugh White has never been a fan of the hawks who believe that Australia's security depends on the United States maintaining its strategic predominance in the western Pacific. Indeed, he has argued and continues to argue that AUKUS may fail to materialise, and even if it does, it may leave Australia more strategically vulnerable than less. He also has some cogent points to make about Pillar II, again, the subject of at least one part of this legislation. The minister, in his second reading speech, declared that the measures in the bill are expected to provide a net benefit to the Australian economy of $614 million over a 10-year period. In a recent article in <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Affairs</span>, White was far from convinced, declaring:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is naive to expect that the easing of some legislative constraints on Australian participation in US defence procurement will send a flood of work our way… In the highly politicised world of defence contracting, our AUKUS partners will always bend over backwards to keep this work at home… Defence industry integration is more likely to mean that work on Australian projects will flow to America and to Britain than the other way around.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And White does have some bona fides in this area. He was high up in the defence department under both Labor and coalition governments, and one of the authors of the <span style="font-style:italic;">2000 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">efence white paper</span> which first raised official concerns about China as a long-term security threat. In his recent essay, he also notes the historical fact that more expensive new tech does not necessarily win wars. More low-end equipment is arguably more effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, not for the first time, we are being asked in this House to vote on legislation drafted before a parliamentary inquiry—on this occasion by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee—is complete. The committee offered several recommendations in line with concerns expressed both by Australian industry and the research community. The committee recommended that the definition of 'fundamental research' at the heart of the legislation be placed in the bill itself. Also, it was recommended that there be further consideration given to the exact definition of the term 'Australian persons', which would determine whether a researcher, for example, would be acceptable under the terms of the Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill 2023. In particular, the committee recommended that the definition is consistent with defence trade controls in the US that provide for exemptions of foreign citizens of states subject to Washington's sanction, regardless of their American residency status. As former Chief Scientist Ian Chubb noted in evidence to the committee: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the proposed new legislation does result in some lightening of the red tape regarding science conducted with colleagues in the US and the UK, potentially, it also raises the bar for the rest of the world, including long-term collaborators in Europe, Southeast Asia, Oceania and the Americas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's at a time when Australia can't get all the STEM expertise we need from the AUKUS nations alone. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We run the risk of passing a piece of legislation that, while it looks beneficial on the surface, makes matters worse because it could exclude expertise from non-AUKUS sources while making us even more dependent on the US defence sector, which is notoriously inward looking and subject to the parochial demands of individual members of Congress. It's not necessarily a criticism of the Americans; it's simply reality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now understand that the government has been consulting with stakeholders in the research community about these provisions and plans to alter the legislation with the intention of addressing these issues. I look forward to seeing what the government proposes and whether any changes fully address concerns. I will otherwise move a series of amendments later to address these issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent days we've seen the Pentagon playing into concerns about whether AUKUS can ever deliver what Scott Morrison promised and that the current Prime Minister rushed to accept for fear of being wedged in the lead-up to the last election. This rare bipartisanship, ironically, is less than ideal in this case, I believe, because—as I alluded to at the start of this speech—it has meant that there's been very limited tolerance for debate and discussion about the finer points of this deal. As part of its game of fiscal chicken with Congress, the Pentagon has proposed a budget that would see just one nuclear submarine off the production line next year, compared with the figure of 2.3 that the US Navy says would be needed to ensure that enough subs are produced to meet Washington's AUKUS commitments as well as its own requirements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question is whether the US Navy had been blinded by reality, given that the official Congressional Research Service reported in December: </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the submarine construction industrial base is currently able to build them at a rate of about 1.2 to 1.3 boats per year, resulting in a growing backlog of SSN—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the Navy is not able to achieve an SSN construction rate of 2.33 boats per year, then replacement boats … could enter service with the US Navy later than indicated … or perhaps not be built at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question then becomes this: if that is the reality, what actual chance is there of Australia getting the subs that it's been pledged in the time frame promised, protracted as it is, or, indeed, ever? What does that mean for AUKUS Pillar II, which is at the centre of this legislation? Those questions exist without even considering the prospect of what would happen should Donald Trump return to the White House with a declared and inward-looking agenda of America first.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  I rise to speak on the Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill 2023. This bill is part of a suite of AUKUS related legislation that aims to ensure that Australia's military export system is aligned with the US. It will cut Australia off from the rest of the world and tie us to the US; this is a precondition for Australia to receive nuclear submarines. This bill will effectively create a licence-free export bubble between Australia, the US and the UK, concerning military and dual-use goods. However, this bill also means that Australia will, effectively, be cut off from the rest of the world—as I said. It will mean harsher and wider restrictions in working with people outside of the Anglo bubble.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill passes in its current state, researchers and businesses working with people from countries like South Korea or India on technology and research that is dual use would have to stop and get approval from the minister or risk 10 years imprisonment. This has drawn widespread criticism from industry and the higher education sector, who have raised real concerns that this new bill will force them to apply for thousands of new permits to do basic research and product development. This bill risks creating a significant disincentive for most of the world to work with Australian researchers and to trade critical technology, and it is not something that the Greens will support.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  I thank all members who have contributed to the debate on these important bills. I'd also like to thank the opposition for their bipartisanship and support in progressing these bills through the parliament. There's been constructive engagement across the aisle and with defence officials to support a considered outcome for Australia's protective security framework. The Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill 2023 and the Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill 2023 represent critical reforms to Australia's protective security framework. In the complex and challenging strategic environment that we face today, preventing our defence technologies, capabilities and information from falling into the hands of our adversaries is paramount.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, these reforms represent a significant opportunity to unlock the benefits of AUKUS, helping establish a seamless industrial base between Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom. These reforms will achieve this by establishing a new licence for the environment among AUKUS partners through a national exemption for the US and UK from Australia's export control licensing requirements under the Defence Trade Controls Act. This will revolutionise collaboration and defence trade, unlocking investment and growth opportunities for Australian industry, research and science. These reforms are expected to provide an estimated net benefit to the economy of $614 million over the next 10 years. The reduction in regulation through the national exemption for export permits to the US and the UK would benefit $5 billion of the almost $9 billion in annual defence exports. These exemptions would also mean that almost a third of the 3,000 export permit applications currently assessed annually are no longer required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's export control regime is a permissive system designed to permit the responsible transfer of controlled goods and technology. These reforms do not change this underlying principle. Similarly, the safeguarding Australia's military secrets bill does not seek to limit the employment opportunities of any Australians. It extends Australia's already robust legislation and policies further by enhancing the protections around our defence information and technology and that of our allies. It adopts a proactive approach by establishing an authorisation framework to regulate the performance of work and specified training to a foreign military, foreign government or foreign government entity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms in these bills strike the balance between protecting our national security while supporting our economic innovation and international research collaboration. These bills will ensure the United Kingdon and the United States can collaborate, innovate and trade at the speed and scale required to meet the challenging strategic circumstances, and they will build Australia's long-term national defence by supporting our AUKUS commitment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills were the subject of inquiry processes by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The government thanks the committees for their work. As I said in my second reading speech, the government is committed to improving the bills through an inquiry process. The assistant minister has outlined in his contribution the government's response to these reports, and the amendments that I will read shortly achieve this aim. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WATSON-BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:33</span>):  If you're feeling like Labor and the Liberal and National parties aren't listening to you and your needs, you'd be right. Recent data on the amount of corporate money that Labor and the Liberal and National parties take in so-called donations shows why. Let me give a few examples.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Liberal and National parties last year took $4 million in donations from the property industry. Just the other week, the Queensland Labor government announced $350 million in handouts for property developers. Meanwhile, you're struggling to pay the rent. The banking and finance sector? They donated $11 million to Labor and the Liberal and National parties last year. In return, the banks have been allowed to rake in over $33 billion in profit, with practically no government scrutiny. Meanwhile, you're struggling to pay your mortgage. Coal, oil and gas corporations last year donated $2 million to Labor and the Liberal and National parties and got over $10 billion of public money in return. Meanwhile, we get heatwaves, floods and cyclones from the growing climate crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have dental in Medicare. I wonder why. Is it because it would hurt the business model of private health insurers like Bupa, who, incidentally, donate tens of thousands of dollars every year to Labor and the Liberal and National parties? While families struggle to make ends meet and young people face an uncertain future of insecure jobs and unaffordable housing, the old parties are cosying up to wealthy donors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's $10 for a block of Coles brand cheese, $4.50 for a carton of milk and more than $10 for a kilo of mince. That's almost $25 just there for the absolute essentials, and you can't even make a family meal out of that. Ten years ago you could feed a family for less than $10, and now it costs double that to make a meal for one. Meanwhile, Coles and Woolies have made record billion-dollar profits and farmers are getting absolutely screwed. Something just doesn't add up. That's price gouging. The former Woolies CEO, Brad Banducci, resigned in disgrace after being questioned about the company's rampant profiteering. The new CEO is on a tidy $2-plus million a year. The Coles CEO is on more than $3 million. Meanwhile, 3.9 million households are stressed about grocery prices. I somehow don't think the Woolies CEO is feeling that stress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government has been talking a big game about looking into supermarket price gouging, but there's been no action. The Greens have proposed to give the competition watchdog powers to smash the duopoly of Coles and Woolies, increase competition and lower prices. It's time Labor and the Liberal and National parties got on board.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The same goes for the airlines, who get a free pass to do pretty much what they want. That's why the Greens have secured a Senate inquiry into aircraft noise, and submissions are now open. Many thousands of Brisbane people have been affected by a huge increase in unbearable flight noise since the opening of the new runway at Brisbane Airport a few years back. Even though there are clear solutions to this, the community has been fobbed off and dismissed by the aviation industry and government regulators. Now we have a moment to put them all on the spot, to turn up the heat and to start getting real solutions. Submissions can be as short or as long as you like. You can find a detailed submissions guide on my website, along with all of the instructions about how to submit. This is your chance to share your story and shine a light on how big airlines and airport corporations have taken control of our government and regulators, putting profits in the way of a good night's sleep for so many across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of corporate capture, many Ryan residents have raised concerns about the lack of mobile coverage in the area. It is utterly unacceptable that in 2024 we are still grappling with the fallout of botched mobile coverage and NBN upgrades. In lovely areas like Moggill, Bellbowrie, Brookfield and The Gap, near the bustling heart of Brisbane, many are stranded in a digital desert, unable to make a simple phone call or easily access the internet. Clearly, the current system is just not working for people because of the stranglehold that privatised Telstra holds over our telecommunications infrastructure, coupled with the for-profit and underfunded NBN's delays in high-speed broadband rollout across the country. The privatisation and corporatisation of our essential services and infrastructure means Australia continues to place last in the OECD rankings for entry-level fixed broadband availability while other countries surge ahead with cutting-edge technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is hope. Through persistent advocacy from my wonderful team, working with locals, we have had some wins. Kenmore Hills, Bellbowrie and The Gap were eventually included in the NBN upgrade rollout, with Kenmore Hills prioritised and full fibre-to-the-premises installations currently ongoing. This was despite these residents initially being told they would have to foot the bill themselves. What a disgrace—huge out-of-pocket costs for essential infrastructure that should have been provided by the government. Now we'll fight the same uphill battle with residents of The Gap and Fig Tree Pocket too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are urban areas. It shouldn't be this hard to get a decent internet connection or mobile coverage. It's an absolute disgrace, but perhaps most infuriating of all is the knowledge that this crisis was entirely avoidable. The short-sighted decision to privatise Telstra in the nineties effectively sold off our future, consigning us to a fate where corporate greed reigns supreme. Telstra, Optus and NBN Co—they're all cut from the same cloth: prioritising profits over people, leaving us at their mercy. We need to put our key infrastructure back in the hands of the public so that it works for the people and not for profit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine thinking that big, profit-hungry developers to whom we hand $350 million are actually going to help fix the housing crisis! That's what Queensland Labor has just announced. It's not clear whether Labor genuinely believe this will work or whether they know it won't but are quite happy to continually do the bidding of the big developers, who are using the housing crisis as an excuse to extract more concessions out of our governments. Here's the thing that Labor and the property industry don't want you to know: big for-profit developers do not want property prices to go down, because that will reduce their profits. This extra money will just line their pockets while they land-bank many suitable sites and hold back the supply of housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For as long as federal Labor isn't willing to touch negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, we've got a system that locks in skyrocketing house prices. The Greens have this radical notion of a public property developer—what a crazy idea! This would mean that the government could actually build homes, like it used to, to rent or sell to everyday people at below the market rate. Since it would be publicly owned, it would ensure that new homes are high-quality, sustainable and in good locations. Over 10 years, it could build over 600,000 homes, and, by providing genuine competition to the for-profit property industry, it would stabilise house prices, giving young people a go at actually owning one.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  I've been involved with Campbelltown Hospital for over four decades, and I've seen the hospital develop into a major teaching hospital. In fact, for a few days the week before last we were the busiest hospital in Australia in terms of emergency department presentations, and our neighbouring teaching hospital, Liverpool Hospital, wasn't far behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had a massive population growth in Macarthur. We're now the biggest electorate in the country by population, and there will need to be a redistribution; in fact, it is already proceeding. Our development is still continuing, though. Thousands of people are moving into the area—there are new suburbs, often named after the old farms that were there before the development, like Gregory Hills, Emerald Hill, Warren Park, Willowdale et cetera—but we've had very little infrastructure, including health infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's distressing to me that lots of my constituents are writing or coming into my office to voice their concerns about the health care that they are getting from our hospital system. I want to congratulate the staff at Campbelltown Hospital for the work that they are doing. Every day, they are inundated with patients, many of them very sick. They are having to deal with this avalanche of patients with very little additional staff or infrastructure. We've built a new hospital, but many of the beds are not filled, because of the lack of staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've written to the New South Wales Minister for Health, Ryan Park, requesting an urgent review of the infrastructure and the staffing of our hospital to try and keep up with the demand. There are so many people presenting to our hospital, often very sick, and they are having to wait a very long time to get the care that they need. They have to wait for a very long time to get that care. Some of the examples of concerns that my office has been contacted about are a mother trying to breastfeed twins in the waiting room of the hospital, but standing up because there was no seat available. And there were people with sepsis having to wait for hours to get any treatment started because there was no doctor available. I'm very worried and concerned about what is happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This should not be a blame game, however. This situation has evolved over decades, with the rapid development in south-west Sydney and the lack of planning and infrastructure. We need to address this now, and we need to address it at the local, state and federal government levels. The federal government is doing some things, the state government is doing some things and even our local council is doing some things to help with health infrastructure, but it isn't working. People get sick of doctors saying that this is a crisis or this is an emergency et cetera, and I don't want to take that approach. This has evolved over a period of time and it's replicated in other places. We've heard about the ambulance ramping in South Australian hospitals and about the long waits for ambulances and long queues in emergency departments in Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and, in fact, around the country. We've heard concerns in Deputy Speaker Archer's own state of Tasmania about getting access to specialist care being diabolical in parts of Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm contacted every day, literally, by constituents who cannot afford the gap fees to see specialists such as cardiologists, neurologists, vascular surgeons, ENT surgeons and ophthalmologists. There's a huge problem with access in Australia, not just to primary health care but to specialist care, and we need to address this in a comprehensive, systemic way. I think that the federal department of health has really failed in its responsibility over the last couple of decades. The recruitment of doctors to work in emergency departments or in general practice has been hampered by the farcical Modified Monash Model, which tries to predict the areas needing support in recruiting doctors. Apart from the inner cities, every area in Australia is an area of need and needs to be seen as such. We need to recruit doctors, be they from overseas or even from the inner cities, to work in the areas of need, such as our outer metropolitan areas and our rural and regional areas. They need support for that and it's time that the department of health owned up to its responsibilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also a huge problem in attracting medical students to go into general practice training schemes, and there are issues with how people can transition from the hospital system into a general practice training scheme. I can tell you that if you work as a hospital registrar in medicine, or surgery or paediatrics, you'll have to take a 40 per cent drop in pay to go into a general practice registrar position. That's ridiculous! It's an active disincentive for people wanting to go into general practice at a time when we have a huge shortage of general practitioners around the country. That should have been addressed years ago. The departments of health at both the state and federal levels knew about this and they've done very little other than some very marginal changes in GP recruitment. We've had the bonded training schemes for medical registrars, which haven't worked, and a lot of time has been wasted in trying to get students who were recruited when they were very young out of these bonded schemes when they've finished their training. They haven't worked and the department of health needs to look at other solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we're faced now with a system where increasing pressure is being put on our emergency departments, not just by the increase in population but by the fact that people cannot get in to see a general practitioner. They cannot afford it or the appointments just aren't available, so they're putting more pressure on our emergency departments. The urgent care centres will help a little, but, when you look at the urgent care centre in Macarthur, for example, they see about 20 patients a day. We have over 300 presentations to our emergency departments. So it really is time, when we have a National Cabinet, for state and federal health ministers to sit down and work through this and organise a plan of management for these emergency problems. It is not going to get better without systemic change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have lost the concept of Medicare as a universal healthcare insurance program. People now cannot get in to see specialists for things like heart checks, removal of cataracts et cetera, because they can't afford it. We are very rapidly developing an American-style system that is leading to a two-tiered system, where wealthy people can afford very high quality care, and poor people either don't get care or have to go on a long waiting list. The waiting list for cataract surgery in my electorate of Macarthur, in the public system, is over two years. Children who have obstructive sleep apnoea because of large tonsils and adenoids have to wait 12 months just to get in to see an ENT surgeon, and their families have to pay for it because there is no public ENT clinic at our hospital because of the downgrading of our outpatients system. That's occurring around Australia, not just in my electorate of Macarthur, and more and more people are being forced to pay large fees to get private surgery done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is similar to what happened before the advent of Medicare, or Medibank, as it was when it was started by Gough Whitlam. In my time as a medical student, before the introduction of Medibank, I saw that the biggest cause of bankruptcy in Australia was medical costs. We are headed back to that system unless there is systematic and systemic change. I am really calling on both state and federal health ministers—Liberal, Labor, doesn't matter. We need to get together and we need to have change; otherwise we will end up with a two-tiered, American-style health system, and that is something that should be avoided at all costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am happy that our Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mark Butler, is doing what he can to try and modify the Medicare system so that people are more able to access bulk-billing, but I am very fearful that, unless urgent change happens across state and systems, we will end up with a very poor system.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="201906" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  I rise to raise grievances on behalf of the Longman community this evening. There is much to be aggrieved about. The first issue I'd like to speak on tonight is the proposed unfair ute tax. The vast majority of people I've spoken to in the Longman community are very much against this. It's a bordering-on-communist tax that penalises people who make the democratic choice to purchase a vehicle powered by diesel or gasoline or a hybrid electric-petrol car. I can understand this Labor government's thinking behind the proposal, but, again, this is an overreach by a far-left-wing government that seeks to deprive Australians of their basic right to choose—to choose what they believe and, in this case, to choose what they buy as far as a vehicle goes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The basic premise is that, if consumers don't buy enough electric vehicles, or EVs, then non-EVs will have extra government costs imposed on them to force people into buying EVs. But people have too many unanswered questions on EVs that this Labor government hasn't answered for them to buy into the narrative. The questions and the comments that I've received include concerns about the volatility of elements in EVs like lithium that have a propensity to catch fire. And many of these rare-earth metals in batteries in EVs are mined in countries that basically allow slave labour. Aren't Labor and their coalition partners, the Greens, concerned about this? The cost of an EV is far too expensive for many in my electorate of Longman to afford. People are concerned about charging and lack of charging infrastructure, and rightly so. Constituents are also concerned about the ability of EVs to tow their caravans and boats, and tradies need to be able to tow trailers laden with tools and building materials, which, last time I checked, were pretty heavy items.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I spoke to a representative from Toyota about their new electric vehicle, and I asked him about charging. He told me the battery capacity is 72 kilowatts, and the unit charges at home, on a standard power point, at two kilowatts per hour, which means it takes 36 hours to fully charge. You can use your car on Monday and then again on Wednesday around lunchtime. Even better news: if you fast-charge it, which still takes hours, that reduces the battery life. How good is this? I'd suggest it's not. This vehicle is similar to the Toyota C-HR. That car starts at $47,160, which is over $22,000 cheaper than this new electric version, which starts at just under $70,000. The more affordable C-HR model is also a hybrid, which sadly gets no breaks under this new proposed tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also asked: won't EVs contribute to landfill? The simple answer is yes. To replace a battery in an EV when the original battery wears out after around 10 years is between $13,000 and $40,000, depending on the model. Who would spend that sort of money on a 10-year-old car? I would suggest no-one. Not only do we end up with hundreds of solar panels from solar farms and wind towers in landfill; now it will be EVs as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's clean up the atmosphere and poison the ground and the waterways! Where is the so-called party for the environment in all this, the Greens, sticking up for the environment? Their silence is just more evidence they are wolves in sheep's clothing, pretending to care for the environment when really they are just a social justice communist party who want to indoctrinate our younger generations with misleading and fearful propaganda so they can control them through fear. For that they should be ashamed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also asking on behalf of the single parent, the uni student or the battler who currently buys a $2,000 second-hand Corolla for a car what they're going to do. There will be no older second-hand cars, as they won't be worth repairing. So what do these people do? Australia used to be a proud democracy where people could make choices based on their individual needs. If someone's lifestyle suits an EV and that suits them, I say, 'Go your hardest.' I won't tell you what to buy, and nor should any government. All the rest of Australia expects is the same freedom to choose what vehicle suits their lifestyle without more government interference and manipulation through unfair taxes in their lives. I say to the people of Longman and Australia: sign my petition and boot the ute tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I'd like to speak about the remarkable cohort of people in our country—those who live with the effects of thalidomide, which was taken by unsuspecting pregnant women back in the early 1960s. As we now know, the drug was completely unsafe, and as a result many babies were born with birth defects, including shortened or absent limbs, blindness, deafness or malformed internal organs. I was so pleased that both major parties were able to come together on this and officially recognise and apologise to these Australians. Former health minister Greg Hunt started the ball rolling, and late last year the Prime Minister made the long-awaited apology those living with the effects of thalidomide had been waiting to hear with the bipartisan support of everyone in this House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is still more to do for these people. I have a strong advocate, Trish Jackson, who lives in my electorate of Longman along with her husband, Trevor. Trish is an inspiration and a great example of overcoming adversity. A thalidomide survivor herself, Trish was instrumental in progressing the apology process, with many discussions and meetings with former minister Hunt and myself. Trish also has her own business called Footsie Photos and Limbitless Art—a play on words. I was fortunate to receive one of Trish's calendars this year. All the art is terrific, and it's done with her feet. Trish has explained to me some of the bureaucratic rubbish she and other survivors have to endure, which I will share with you now. These are the words of the survivors themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 1 is medications. The processing for both survivors and the admin and office is likely costing more than some of the medications. I would suggest it would be easier to give all the free medications by adding the safety net switch that already exists. I'm not sure how that would work for survivors without a health care card, but it should be easier to solve and cheaper for the government. The additional medications some may get for free for non-thalidomide issues, but I would expect it would be less than the current refund processing costs, and, for all their suffering, this should not be an issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 2 is that remittance advice should be electronic. That's probably fair enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 3 is that the form is out of control. It's a full Centrelink application form each and every time. Why couldn't this be added to the NDIS app as a funding or claim type for survivors so the documents can be easily uploaded each time? Why couldn't the login be the signature instead of the manual process in Adobe? The process is manual-heavy and confusing for those who don't do forms often, and some are not claiming because of this. I'm sure this was no-one's intent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 4 is that the limitation in the online submission means that, after one receipt alone, the form often exceeds the limit. The other option is to email, but there's a statement with that that says privacy could be compromised, and many won't use it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 5 is the development of a working group of survivors, similar to the process that the NDIS has, whereby a group of survivors help to shape the outcomes. We have amazing advocates who are not survivors; however, it would be great to get some different perspectives directly. It could be an annual program in which a group of survivors are brought together on topics and provide feedback during the year, with an application process designed to also reach those who aren't claiming. Personally, I reckon it's a great idea to actually engage with the people who have lived experience—it's a new concept, I know!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 6 is that all thalidomide survivors should be given a healthcare card regardless of their financial status. This would reduce the cost to be recovered as much as it would help survivors. Some survivors do not have these items, as their partner still works and has income assets that prevent this. The survivor then struggles with being a burden on their partner, even if it is just a cashflow issue until a claim is provided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 7 is that EAF claim options can be better explained. There is a disparity in what is being claimed, as some understand extraordinarily better than others and the process appears to be subjective in review.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 8 is that requiring doctor forms every 12 months assumes the situation will improve. The reality is that disability and pain only gets worse with age. They need receipts to claim, so they can't claim something a doctor hasn't prescribed. The form should only be needed once. If the specialist, treatment or medication expenses continue, the cause has not changed. The assumption is incorrect. When it was explained to me, I was aghast that we subject anyone to this level of stress and stupidity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there's No. 9: the proof of life. The numerous Medicare and HCAF claims appear to prove life. Maybe there should be something linked to that—that is, a proof-of-life form is required if, in the system, there is no evidence of life. Registering a death is required for most of these processes, so this seems weird to everyone involved. Our chemist thought it was hilarious. Let's listen to these people and do all we can to make their lives easier, because they deserve it. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  My electorate of Chisholm really values education and lifelong learning. We're home to world-class universities—Monash University and Deakin University—fantastic TAFE and vocational educational institutions and some truly wonderful primary schools and secondary schools. Over the last two weeks I've had the joy of holding mock parliaments with year 5 and 6 students at Laburnum Primary School in Blackburn South; year 6 students at Wattle Park Primary School in Burwood; and year 5 and 6 students at St Justin's Catholic Primary School in Wheelers Hill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was so impressed by the energy and enthusiasm the students had for learning about our democracy and our parliament. The students had some excellent questions which I wanted to answer here today. A lot of their questions were about the mace in the House of Representatives. So, students, the mace is made of solid silver with gold plating, and it weighs 7.8 kilograms. It was made in London and was made to look like the mace used in the British House of Commons. It was a gift to the Australian parliament in 1951 from the British House of Commons and King George VI. Thank you so much to the students and their incredible teachers for welcoming me into their classrooms, and I look forward to visiting again soon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also recently held a round table with year 12 leaders from right across my electorate. It's so important to speak directly to young people and understand the issues that are on their mind. The policies we make in this place impact them, even if some of them can't vote yet, and they deserve to have a say about our country and our future. As leaders of their schools, the year 12 leaders spoke on behalf of their school communities. Some of the issues they raised with me were the environment and climate change, LGBTIQA+ rights, navigating the transition from high school to adulthood, the mental health of students, concerns about being able to buy a house in the future, balancing part-time and casual work with study, the cost of going to university, the importance of work experience and careers counselling for students, and their strong desire to be taught life skills in school. I want to sincerely thank the year 12 leaders for their insights, perspectives and passion for serving their school communities and advocating for their peers. These are true leaders in our community and wonderful representatives of our schools and our broader area. I want to thank them so much for attending the forum. I look forward to bringing the group together again soon. It was really a source of great joy for me to see so many friendships formed through the cohort of student leaders from right across my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to congratulate Charlotte Sing from Presbyterian Ladies College in Burwood for being named the Victorian winner of the 2024 Simpson Prize. The Simpson Prize is a national competition for year 9 and year 10 students that focuses on the service of Australians in World War I. Charlotte was chosen from more than 1,000 entries from 79 schools across Australia. I know Charlotte has a passion for history and deeply cares for our community. She chose to complete work experience in my office last year, and I am delighted to see Charlotte thriving in her schooling. It was wonderful to be able to congratulate Charlotte in person today at the award ceremony here in Parliament House with the Minister for Education, Jason Clare. Congratulations to Charlotte. I am so looking forward to what the future holds for you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was fantastic, too, to welcome Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Emma McBride, to visit the brand-new headspace in Box Hill recently. The headspace in Box Hill provides free mental health and wellbeing support for young people aged 12 to 25 years of age. This centre was delivered with $3.6 million as an election commitment from the Albanese Labor government. Assistant Minister McBride and I met with Ananya Krishna and Sankara Santosa, who are members of the youth reference group. They helped to design the space, which is beautiful, and provide ongoing advice and feedback to the headspace Box Hill team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also met with the broader Box Hill headspace team, Mind Australia and the Eastern Melbourne Public Healthcare Network, who are so passionate about supporting the mental health of young people in our community. Headspace Box Hill have only just officially opened their doors and already there is an incredibly strong demand for their services. I think this really shows just how needed this service was for our community. For young people in Mount Waverley and the surrounding suburbs, headspace Syndal, just two doors down from my office, also provides free mental health and wellbeing services. I have visited both centres, and the staff there are truly remarkable. I commend everybody for the work that they do in our community supporting young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the weekend I was delighted to attend the 2024 Roberts McCubbin Primary School Art Show in Box Hill South. The Roberts McCubbin Primary School Art Show has been running for nearly 30 years, showcasing the work of local artists and benefiting the Roberts McCubbin Primary School community. I am a sponsor of the art show and I love being able to support such a terrific initiative. Congratulations to everyone who was involved in putting on such a spectacular exhibition. I was fortunate to secure a beautiful watercolour piece that was on display that I am looking forward to displaying in my office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a proud supporter of small businesses in Chisholm. I recently held a small-business round table with the Minister for Small Business, Julie Collins. We spoke with representatives from a variety of small-business organisations from right across my electorate, including the Asian Business Association of Whitehorse, the Glen Waverley Traders Association, the Monash Precinct Network and the South East Melbourne Manufacturers Alliance. We heard about the challenges that small businesses are facing and we spoke about our government initiatives to support small and medium-sized businesses. I am proud to represent Chisholm, which is a community I know very well and love. As someone who grew up with parents who ran their own business, I know how important it is that we see small and medium and family businesses thrive right through our community. I take very seriously my responsibility to support education and to support small business in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being here, being able to talk about the wonderful groups and people in my electorate, is a privilege that I never take for granted. I'm really ambitious for our community. The meetings I've had over the last two weeks really encouraged me. There is so much opportunity that our government will be able to support. I look forward to continuing to show up for, care and support my community for as long as I can.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299498" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  It was an incredible privilege to be elected as the federal member for Flynn at the 2022 federal election. I've worked hard to get around to as many local communities as possible, and this has been a significant challenge, given the fact that the Flynn electorate is over 132,000 square kilometres, an area almost twice the size of Tasmania. It stretches from the Central Highlands in the west to Gracemere in the north to Gladstone in the east and Wondai and Proston in the south. I travel approximately 50,000 kilometres a year, staying in touch with our local communities, and spend 20 weeks a year in Canberra representing Flynn in the federal parliament. In my first year as the federal member I spent 73 nights at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this time, I've seen firsthand the detrimental impacts that legislation and policies can have on our regional communities. The Labor government continues to implement a one-size-fits-all bureaucratic policy that just does not work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One issue that I hear about constantly is the lack of child care in regional Australia. In my electorate, many families cannot find child care or a place for their child. This is preventing parents from returning to work sooner. Our communities need availability and accessibility as well as affordability. Centres are capping enrolments, closing rooms and asking children to stay home. I've spoken to families stuck on waiting lists, unable to work because there are no places to look after their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In February this year the Labor government opened competitive round 4 of the Community Child Care Fund disadvantaged and vulnerable communities grants. The intent of the communities grant is to support early childhood education and care, ECEC, services operating in underserved, disadvantaged and vulnerable communities to be able to address, or have increased capacity to address, community-level barriers to child participation in early childhood services. It is also to increase the number of children from vulnerable or disadvantaged families and communities accessing ECEC; to increase the viability of ECEC services operating in disadvantaged communities, including in areas with fluctuating and/or low short-term demand; and to increase the availability of ECEC places in disadvantaged communities with high or unmet demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I welcome these grants and their intent, they're another example of bureaucratic nonsense. This grants round was open for one month—just one month. The Labor government and the minister obviously do not want anybody to apply. The eligibility criteria mean that small community kindergartens in rural and remote Australia who wish to expand to make day care services available are ineligible to receive the Community Child Care Fund disadvantaged and vulnerable communities grants because they cannot get approval for childcare services under the family assistance law until the grant is received and the facility is built in the first place. What genius came up with this idea? Instead of taking action to improve access to child care for rural Australians, Labor is spending billions on subsidising childcare costs for families in the big city whilst ignoring rural and regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In September 2022, I wrote to the Treasurer about the increasing community concerns around the lack of child care in the electorate of Flynn, especially in our more rural regions, and the financial barriers to entering the sector when establishing a family day care centre. This government must deliver more access to early childhood education and care places to support Australians returning to the workforce and for real cost-of-living relief for families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been almost two years since the federal government made its 2022 election commitments. Hundreds of projects have failed to commence, according to documents recently released to parliament. Organisations and councils in Flynn have been unfairly subjected to long and unnecessary bureaucratic processes. Our community has been forced to jump through the Albanese government's hoops just to receive the funding that was promised to it before Labor was elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, four projects have failed to commence and are still being held up by Labor's incompetence. These include stage 3B of the promised Biloela Raedon Street industrial estate. This was set to create up to 100 skilled jobs, with the facility giving local entrepreneurs the workshop space they need to compete for more industrial work and leading to more skilled jobs for local workers. I ask the government: where is the money? The clubhouse expansion for the Boyne Tannum Football Club, the Sharks, was promised. This expansion included facilities that would allow players to have access to state-of-the-art sporting venues. More than 250 players, coaches and volunteers play on the Sharks football field, not to mention the tens of thousands of families, friends and visitors who come to the venue each year. Again I ask the government: where is the money? The Gladstone regional indoor sports complex was promised. It was set to have a new facility to host basketball, futsal, MMA, netball, volleyball, roller derby and a host of other indoor activities. Again, I ask: where is the money? The aquatic centre for Boyne Island and Tannum Sands was promised. It was set to deliver a brand-new aquatics facility, including an Olympic-sized pool with aquatic play and exercise features for many families. Once again, where is the money? These delays demonstrate the low regard the Albanese government has for Flynn community groups. Councils have been left in the lurch by the Labor government after they were promised that these projects would be delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make the chamber aware of a group of high-profile agriculturalists, including agricultural bodies such as AgForce and the Queensland Farmers Federation, that have filed pending legal action in the Federal Court with respect to the carbon dioxide sequestering project in the Great Artesian Basin by resources giant Glencore. This project was deemed not to be a controlled action by the federal EPBC office in February 2021. It defies logic that the EPBC Act in its current form offers no protection to the waters of the Great Artesian Basin unless it concerns coal or gas. The Great Artesian Basin is the world's largest underground potable water source. It needs to be protected from the lunacy of dumping industrial waste to create carbon credits so that large corporations can generate billions in revenue. Last year, the Nationals proposed a critical amendment to the Nature Repair Bill 2023 to protect the Great Artesian Basin from companies pumping hypercritical CO2 fluid into it. However, the Labor government and the Greens voted the amendment down—another deplorable decision by this government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the Queensland Labor government announced that $500 million had been committed to the beef corridors in Central Queensland, despite the federal Labor government pushing back the start date of the upgrade from the 2025 financial year until the 2027-28 financial year. The project was due to be funded jointly, with $400 million from the federal government and $100 million from the state government. Premier Miles and Prime Minister Albanese need to jump in the car and see firsthand how bad these roads are. They need to stop making decisions affecting the lives of our regional communities from their desks in Brisbane and Canberra. I invite both of them to come for a drive in a truck, and I'm sure they'll have a change of mind. Central Queensland is the economic engine room of Australia, and yet the Labor government continues to kick vital infrastructure funding to the bottom of the priority list. The Labor government's decision to delay funding for the beef corridors is evidence that they're happy to treat Central Queensland like a cash cow but not to invest in the infrastructure the regions need. This delay places a question mark over the project, a project which has the support of seven mayors from seven Queensland local government areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it that the Labor government continues to bite the hand that feeds it? The government has introduced a new tax to parliament which will force Australian farmers to pay for biosecurity costs on international importers, pushing up prices on Australian-grown produce at supermarkets. The Labor government will now set the tax rate as a proportion of an industry's average gross value for production over a three-year period, rather than the base rate of 10 per cent on industry-led levies, due to confusion in the levy system and inequities. Yet, at the same time, they've betrayed Central Queensland by delaying the beef corridors upgrade, which is an upgrade that will not only improve road safety for all users but form a strategic web of agricultural supply chains from east to west. The beef corridors upgrade is about improving road safety for all road users while enhancing productivity through reducing or eliminating impediments on delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been almost two years since the last federal election, and we've seen failure after failure in Central Queensland by this Labor government. I will continue to hold it to account, and I will be campaigning hard for the return of a coalition government at the next election.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  Tonight I rise in this grievance debate to raise an issue on behalf of one of my constituents and to also highlight the extent to which our banks are going to reduce cash in our society. In today's world, there's a lot of talk about modernising how we handle money, and that's great. Many of us in this place use apps, cards and the internet to pay for our bills. Even when you go shopping, you tap your phone and you pay for you bill, and that's great for us that are IT savvy or that don't have a necessity to use cash. When you're an individual, you don't have that necessity to use cash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But recently I've been contacted by many constituents—and there's specifically one I'll talk about in a moment—who have small businesses that still need a cash flow. They still need to have $50 notes, $100 notes, $20 notes, $10 notes, $5 notes, 50c coins, 20c coins and 10c coins in their cash registers because people still go to small businesses and pay in cash. Cash isn't just old fashioned. It's still important for a lot of people, especially those in small business. When you think about small-business owners who want to make sure everyone can buy their product, they need to utilise every single facility that they have, including the internet, apps, pay-as-you-go with your phone, and EFTPOS cards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Accepting cash means they're accessible to everyone, especially older Australians that still want to use cash, and many of them prefer using cash because it's familiar and it's easy. For them it's not just about convenience; it's about feeling secure as well, knowing that you have that cash in your pocket. That's the way that they've been brought up their entire lives, and they don't want to change. It is absolutely their right not to change the way they handle their money. So, while all of us in this place are for progress, let's not leave anyone behind. I really feel that, through the banking system, we're currently leaving some people behind, including our small businesses that still rely on cash because they have cash customers and a lot of our older constituents who rely on cash because they're not interested in doing things with cashless cards and tapping on phones et cetera.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was recently contacted by Mary. She's the owner of a small Bakers Delight branch in one of the biggest malls in South Australia, the West Lakes mall. Her insight serves as a reminder of why maintaining cash as a viable option is essential. I'm confident that Bakers Delight holds a special place in all of our hearts. We all know Bakers Delight. I'm sure that each and every one of us have many Bakers Delights and small businesses in our electorates. They're very hardworking small-business people that run these small businesses, and of course, as with any small business, managing cash flow is paramount. It is one of the most important issues that you have in a small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mary informed me of the situation that her business has now found itself in, which for several reasons had me quite concerned, and I'm sure it'd have all of us concerned. Last year, her local ANZ branch within the West Lakes mall, where her Bakers Delight is, decided to stop over-the-counter cash deposits and cash withdrawals. This left her with no way to get change for her store to start the day. You need to have a cash register with change in it. The ANZ branch stopped giving out change and cash to their clients. Mary is their client. She pays fees. She pays interest rates. She pays a whole range of things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While they could still deposit money using the business account deposit facility cash exchange, that was no longer an option. So when they tried to access the cash exchange facility at BankSA—there is a whole range of different banks within this mall, one of the largest malls in South Australia—they were told they would have to switch their account, which isn't easy when you have a small business. When they approached other banks, they were told they had to switch their accounts before they would give them the cash they needed to run their business. On top of all of this, Mary emailed me today with another update. She said that when she went to exchange cash on the weekend, as she does now regularly, at another ANZ branch, six to seven kilometres away from where her business is, the only machine that she had to drive to was out of action. Not only was it out of action; she was informed that it would no longer be operating because they had stopped that one as well. She said that she was so frustrated to think that banks are literally forcing people away from cash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the things that I've just outlined, there's no doubt that banks are forcing people out of cash. It's fine for others who can use their mobiles and their cards and the internet, but when you have a small business, you need to have a cash flow. It's becoming more and more difficult for these small businesses. She said that the banks no longer offer the service that banks were originally designed for. If I were a customer with a small business, I'd go to them in the morning or evening and deposit the cash turnover from the business and get a cash flow for the day. That's the normal practice. That is now stopping and becoming very rare around Australia, and it has become very hard for small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mary said that she feels that the banks have lost their way. All the expenses of the community have helped them become so powerful in our community. In other words, when you look at banks, they're not actually offering their cash; they're offering our cash—it's the cash of small business, it's the cash of big business, and it's the cash of each and every one of us here in Australia. They have a responsibility to provide cash to small businesses and to their customers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can see how frustrating this is for Mary and for other business owners in my electorate. This isn't just a problem for them. Many businesses, not just within Westfield West Lakes but also across Australia, are struggling with cash shortages and accessing cash for their small businesses, causing inconvenience for both businesses and customers. In light of this, I reached out to the Assistant Treasurer, the member for Whitlam, to share Mary's story. I thought it was important that the minister was aware of this. I shared the story of Mary from Bakers Delight and highlighted the importance of maintaining accessible cash options for all Australians. I'm assured by the minister that the government is committed to maintaining adequate access to cash for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cash system provides resilience to the Australian payment system in times of natural disasters, crises and network outages. Recent internet outages have highlighted the importance of cash transactions. A few months ago, Optus wiped out every internet connection across the country. You can imagine that, if you're a small business and you're wiped out of any cash transaction through the internet for seven or eight hours, it could be devastating to your business. During this time, businesses could only accept cash, resulting in lost sales and additional costs. The nation's commerce came to a standstill on that day. We all remember it, as everyone awaited the restoration of payment systems. We all need to inform people who make decisions that this is a really important issue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Banks have a responsibility to service the Australian public. We have four big banks that are very privileged to have a banking licence. That comes with a privilege. It is not there just for them to be able to interact ad hoc as they please within the community. They have a responsibility to look after their customers, to look after the people who put their money into that bank and to look after the customers who require cash to run their small businesses. Can you imagine how difficult it is for Mary and other constituents in my electorate who have been trying now for months to find a place where they can access cash very quickly in the morning or evening when they close their business? Not everyone uses the internet or a phone tap or a card. We need to ensure that banks are doing the right thing. I call on banks today, as many of my colleagues in this place on both sides would agree, to do the right thing and provide cash for small businesses.</span>
