              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DYW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:01</span>):  Joy McKean was a great, great leader in the Australian music industry, a true storyteller and a trailblazer. I met her in the briefest interaction 20 years ago at the funeral of her husband, Slim Dusty. I came to know her better 10 years ago when I was arts minister, attending one of the Slim Dusty Day events. And now, 10 years later, we're remembering Joy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, I had the honour to present Joy with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Australian Women in Music Awards. There, where you have women across all genres in the music industry, all with a central focus on the role of Joy McKean as a leader, as a visionary and as a brilliant songwriter. Her acceptance speech was very, very her—an ode to women in music and a thankyou to musicians, songwriters and her family. She opened with an acknowledgement of the award. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The first thing I can say is that I never thought it would happen—an awards night for us!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She identified with the plight of the women in the room and the shared purpose of the awards to improve gender equality in the music industry. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I used to always think that all this might eventually happen, but it took a darn long while.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was proud of the progress in country music, that, and I quote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… women in country music are writing what they want to write, and they're singing it loud and clear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joy made an outstanding contribution. She was a giant of Australian country music. Her songwriting really did transport you. Music was a crucial part of her life, from her earliest years growing up in the Hunter Valley. Along with her sister Heather, they performed two-part yodelling harmonies, standing out from the crowd and beginning lifelong journeys as songwriters. As well as her deep connection to music as an artist, she was also a pioneer for women in the music business. She was Slim Dusty's manager and life partner, a relationship of over 50 years of love and music. Joy won the first ever Golden Guitar Award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival in 1973 for 'Lights on the Hill', which she said she wrote to the rhythm of windshield wipers driving through country New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Joy first started writing music in the 1950s, the industry was truly male dominated. As an artist and as a manager there were few opportunities for women at the time to be recognised for their work in shaping Australia's cultural identity. As Slim Dusty's manager, Joy was a huge part of his lucrative career, creating more than 100 albums, winning 45 Golden Guitars and touring together all over Australia. The breadth of those tours across Australia is almost incomprehensible. We're not just talking major towns. Peter Garrett, when he was here, used to often relate the first time Midnight Oil decided that they'd go out to remote First Nations communities where no band had ever performed before. At the end of the gig they'd say, 'How does it feel to have us out here?' chatting about it. The First Nations attendees at the gigs would say: 'Oh, yeah. Slim and Joy came through quite a bit.' They never made a big fuss of it, but they made sure, no matter where you lived in Australia, their music was there for you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Keith Urban reflected on Joy McKean, correcting that often terrible phrase that gets used about 'behind a great man is a great woman'. Keith Urban just said, 'In Slim's case, she was always right beside him.' Passionately continuing the deep-rooted tradition in the Australian music industry of helping up-and-coming artists, Joy McKean played a key role in the careers and lives of so many great Australian talents. Legends like singer-songwriter Beccy Cole and Kasey Chambers have recognised and thanked Joy for her empathetic and nurturing spirit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We honour her now, but people also honoured her through her life. Who gets the likes of Paul Kelly, Troy Cassar-Daley, Beccy Cole and Don Walker performing at their 90th birthday concert? Joy McKean was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for her services to the contemporary Australian music industry, and only a few years ago, in 2021, she was honoured with the Ted Albert Award for outstanding services to Australian music, along with her large collection of deserving accolades. Singer and songwriter Georgia Mooney said at that time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Joy is the very definition of a quiet achiever. Humble, wise, tough and profoundly talented. Her contribution to Australian music is too immense to measure. I've no doubt she will continue to inspire songwriters for years to come, especially women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world was made better for her 93 years, which she dedicated to her love of life, family and music. Joy sang in her record 'I Don't Believe You'—she wrote this after Slim had passed—this beautiful lyric:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Don't say a song won't live, after the singer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Don't say that love is lost, while the memory lingers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The queen of Australian country music, Joy leaves us with so much more than a memory. She leaves us with song that will forever be played.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:07</span>):  I'm pleased to rise on behalf of the opposition to acknowledge and express our sadness at the passing of Joy McKean, the musician and multi-award-winning songwriter Joy McKean OAM. Her loss will be felt not only through the music world but by countless people who've appreciated and listened to her songs over the years. She has rightly been described as a national treasure by Troy Cassar-Daley and as the backbone of so much of the Australian country music industry by Kasey Chambers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was born in Singleton, New South Wales, in 1930. She loved her music as a child, learning to play a range of instruments, including accordion, piano and steel guitar. As we've heard from the Minister for the Arts in his remarks, she won the first Golden Guitar, in 1973, for her song 'Lights On the Hill'. That song was inspired by an authentically Aussie experience, towing a heavy caravan up the then notorious Devils Pinch near Guyra on the New South Wales Northern Tablelands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She married Slim Dusty in 1951. Together they became a powerhouse in country music, a musical partnership producing more than 100 albums and selling more than eight million albums. She was dedicated to making a difference to the lives of others. She helped create the Country Music Association of Australia and was chairwoman of the Slim Dusty Foundation, which built the Slim Dusty Centre in the singer's hometown of Kempsey. She is survived by her children, Anne Kirkpatrick and David Kirkpatrick; four grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. Australia may have lost an icon, but her legacy will inspire future musicians and live on for generations.</span>

So he decided to go to Slim Dusty and ask him if he could use one of their songs in his campaign. That song was 'I Love to Have a Beer with Duncan'. That became a part of his campaign. Duncan won that election because there were lots of people that decided they would like to have a beer with Duncan.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (2023 Measures No. 3) Bill 2023 will improve the integrity of consumer markets for credit products, remove barriers for financial advisers, and support competition in the provision of clearing and settlement services for cash equities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 to the bill introduces new rules that prohibit schemes designed to avoid the application of product intervention orders made under part 7.9A of the Corporations Act 2001, in relation to a credit facility. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Safe, well-regulated consumer markets for credit products are a core element of a strong and inclusive economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Australian government introduced reforms to the regulation of payday lending and consumer leases through the Financial Sector Reform Act 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes were long overdue and they gave effect to the government's response to recommendations of the 2016 review of small amount credit contract laws, which included a recommendation to introduce laws to prohibit avoidance behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Financial Sector Reform Act 2022 introduced anti-avoidance provisions with respect to Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) product intervention orders which were made under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. This bill extends these provisions to product intervention orders that are made under the Corporations Act of 2001.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIC has made several product intervention orders under the Corporations Act 2001 targeting predatory lending products causing significant consumer harm—that is, the predatory lending products were causing significant consumer harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Product intervention orders quite simply allow ASIC to temporarily intervene in a range of ways up to, when necessary, banning financial products and credit products when there is a significant risk of consumer detriment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By bringing the anti-avoidance provisions in the Corporations Act into line with those in the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, this amendment will ensure that predatory lenders cannot respond to a product intervention order by engaging in avoidance activity that is not covered by the order but results in a similar kind of detriment to consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill is an important one. It delivers on the government's election commitment to remove the education requirements for experienced financial advisers who have 10 years experience and a clean record, who have passed the financial adviser's exam.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 also addresses technical limitations in the education requirements for new entrants into the financial advice profession and financial advisers who are registered tax agents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Together, these amendments address practical implementation issues faced by financial advisers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By better recognising the experience of long-serving financial advisers, the government is providing a pathway for experienced advisers to remain in the industry. This means that new entrants have the benefit of their experience through mentoring, through supervision and through employment. It also means that more Australians will have access to financial advice than would otherwise be the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to an advice industry with strong professional standards that give Australians access to high-quality financial advice and to do this by not creating unnecessary barriers to entry, ensuring financial advice remains a career of choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 to the bill implements the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001, the Corporations Act 2001, and the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to facilitate competition in the provision of clearing and settlement services for cash equities traded in Australia, and to ensure that, should competition emerge for these services, it is safe and effective. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments implement a recommendation of the Council of Financial Regulators, which considered issues relating to competition in clearing and settlement services of cash equities in 2012, 2015 and 2017. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To do so, schedule 3 introduces a rule-making power for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and an arbitration power for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The rule-making power will allow ASIC to make rules applicable to clearing and settlement facility licensees, their associated entities, and other persons specified by the regulations, about their activities, conduct, or governance in relation to clearing and settlement services covered by a ministerial determination. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIC will be empowered to make rules to implement the Council of Financial Regulators' policy statements in both a monopoly or a competitive environment. This flexibility will allow ASIC to adjust regulatory settings where a committed competitor for the provision of clearing and settlement services emerges to ensure that competition is both safe and effective. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the interim, ASIC will be able to make rules enforcing the Council of Financial Regulators' regulatory expectation for the monopoly provision of clearing and settlement services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The arbitration power will allow for the ACCC to arbitrate disputes about the terms and conditions of access to clearing and settlement services subject to a ministerial declaration. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government expects this declaration will only cover certain clearing and settlement services provided under monopoly conditions, or where a provider exerts a significant market power. Once competition is effective for those clearing and settlement services, the government expects that the ministerial declaration would be repealed in respect of those competitive services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Until then, this arbitration regime will provide an important backstop for entities seeking access to clearing and settlement facility infrastructure where good-faith negotiations have broken down. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 to the bill makes a number of technical changes to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to provide the operation of the First Home Super Saver Scheme so that it works better for first home buyers, something that could not be claimed at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the legislation underpinning the First Home Super Saver Scheme is inflexible and can result in a poor user experience with the scheme, including users having their savings for a first home locked away until retirement, not what was intended by the scheme but the way the scheme is operating under its current rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will better enable mistakes made during the First Home Super Saver Scheme release process to be fixed without adverse financial outcomes for those who use the scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To do so, schedule 4 will increase the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation to amend and revoke applications to have funds released under the First Home Super Saver Scheme, and will allow individuals to do the same, without those individuals being prevented from reapplying in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, these changes will apply to eligible applications made from 1 July 2018, so they will be retrospective. This helps ensure users of the scheme who have not been paid any of their First Home Super Saver Scheme savings due to an error in the application process can access the money they saved for that purpose to purchase their first home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 also includes special transitional provisions which extend the flexibility provided by the amendments to eligible users who previously unsuccessfully applied to have savings released under the scheme and have since started holding a relevant interest in real property or land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Legislative and Governance Forum for Corporations was notified in relation to the amendments made in schedules 1 and 2 to this bill as required under the Corporations Agreement 2002.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Until recently, it would have been unthinkable that Neo-Nazis would burn crosses and openly chant white supremacist slogans in a popular national park or perform Nazi salutes in the front of the Victorian parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But over the last several years, we have seen these incidents and more. Today, the Albanese government is taking a significant step towards sending a message that Australia is united against displays of hate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Prohibited Hate Symbols and Other Measures) Bill 2023 makes critical changes to the Commonwealth Criminal Code to support law enforcement in their efforts to manage and protect the community from those planning, preparing and inspiring others to do harm.</span>
                </p>

                    <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none underline;">Criminalising the public display and trading of the prohibited Nazi and Islamic State symbols</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of the bill makes it a criminal offence to publicly display prohibited symbols—the Nazi hakenkreuz, the Nazi double sig rune, and the Islamic State flag—and trade items bearing these symbols.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nazi hakenkreuz and the Nazi double sig rune, also known as the Schutzstaffel insignia, represent the vile ideology of the Third Reich and conjure fear in many parts of the Australian community whose families suffered the horrors of the Holocaust. These symbols are also used to promote hatred of other groups, including LGBTIQ+ Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the Islamic State flag is representative of abhorrent actions taken by one of the world's deadliest and most active terrorist organisations. Despite no longer controlling territory in Iraq and Syria, Islamic State remains an active terrorist organisation, conducting regular attacks on security forces and civilians. Islamic State continues to incite and carry out violent acts against Muslims and non-Muslim religious minorities within the region and globally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Extremist insignia are an effective propaganda tool because they are easy to remember and understand. They also transcend language and cultural divides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new public display offence in this bill is designed to stamp out the harassment and vilification of innocent Australians whose communities are callously targeted by Nazi, Neo-Nazi and Islamic State supporters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The trading offence ensures that a person cannot profit from selling, renting or leasing paraphernalia containing these symbols of hate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also enables law enforcement to issue a direction to a person requiring the removal of prohibited symbols from public display.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These offences have been carefully considered and crafted so as not to capture legitimate uses of these symbols. The bill expressly excludes conduct that is done for a religious, academic, educational, artistic, literary, scientific or journalistic purpose. Significantly, it will be the responsibility of the prosecution—not the defence—to prove that the alleged conduct fell outside those exemptions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, public display for the purposes of education is permitted so the horrors of the Second World War are not forgotten, and can continue to be taught as a lesson for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government similarly acknowledges the continued importance of the sacred swastika as a symbol that has immense significance to the Buddhist, Hindu, Jain and other communities of faith. The government recognises the distinction between the sacred swastika and the misappropriated Nazi hakenkreuz. The bill protects the use of the sacred swastika for the purpose of religious observance in recognition of its immense significance to these faith communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, in criminalising the public display and trade in the Islamic State symbol, the government recognises the important distinction between Islamic State, which is a terrorist organisation with a violent ideology, and the Islamic faith, which is deeply respected and valued as part of Australia's multicultural society. The government condemns Islamophobia and stands with the Australian Muslim community in opposition to terrorism in all its forms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill complements the efforts of state and territory governments around the country who have legislated similar prohibitions in their respective jurisdictions. The bill extends to matters where the Commonwealth has particular responsibilities, including those with respect to trade and the online environment.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Violent extremist material, which is used to incite violence and instil fear in the community, has no place in our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is presently a crime to possess material that is connected with a terrorist act it is not a crime to possess violent extremist material where, for example, planning for an attack is not underway. Schedule 2 of the bill addresses that gap by creating new offences for using a carriage service to possess or disseminate violent extremist material, noting the harmful nature of the material itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The offences, punishable by up to five years imprisonment, will facilitate law enforcement intervention at an earlier stage in individuals' progress to violent radicalisation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill strengthens the offence of advocating terrorism in the Criminal Code.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The promotion and idealisation of extremist views is of increasing concern, particularly with respect to young people becoming radicalised online. Glorifying terrorists or providing guidance on the commission of terrorist acts can incite others to imitate or seek to engage in similar behaviour, and further their radicalisation. To address this, the bill expands the offence for advocating terrorism in the Criminal Code to include instructing on the doing of a terrorist act or praising the doing of a terrorist act in circumstances where there is a substantial risk that such praise might lead someone to engage in a terrorist act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising that advocating terrorism is a serious act that can lead to violence against innocent Australians, the bill increases the maximum penalty for this offence from five to seven years imprisonment. The new penalty more appropriately accounts for the severity of potential offending. </span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of the bill amends the Criminal Code to provide that regulations that proscribe terrorist organisations do not lapse after three years but continue indefinitely unless revoked by the AFP minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current sunsetting date of three years is unnecessarily short and does not reflect the longevity of terrorist organisations. Some of the 41 organisations listed since 2002 have been relisted as many as eight times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure the appropriateness of the listing of organisations, the bill requires the AFP minister to take steps to remove the organisation from the list as soon as practicable if they become aware that an organisation no longer meets the listing threshold. Any person can make an application to the AFP minister to revoke a listing instrument in relation to a terrorist organisation.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also grants the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security an own-motion power to commence a review as to whether an organisation continues to satisfy the threshold to be listed as a terrorist organisation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I raise this as a matter of urgency because as I speak our airwaves are flooded with advertisements encouraging and grooming our young people, my children and yours, to think there's an inextricable link between sport and gambling; that you can't have one without the other; and that, instead of sport being fun, health, participation and people, you're not one of the gang unless you know as much about the intricacies of multis as you do about the finer points of the game you're watching. I presented my private member's bill in this place on 22 May. It would introduce a complete ban on gambling advertising across radio and broadcast television as well as streaming services and their associated apps. We need to debate this bill now because it's in line with what the community wants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week, ABC TV's <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program presented disturbing evidence that gambling companies are targeting community sport, marketing games to gamblers sometimes even without the knowledge of the sporting clubs themselves. As we debate whether to even debate this bill in this House this morning, rapidly advancing technology means every day lost without tightening the rules affects more young people, more families, more communities and more local economies, with blanket gambling advertising across free-to-air and pay TV, streaming services, radio and online further normalising betting day by day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Polling last year showed that 71 per cent of those polled want gambling advertising banned. Recent research commissioned by the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation found that 78 per cent of respondents believed they should be able to watch sport free of gambling ads. The need for this legislation is urgent because the social costs of gambling and gambling addiction are significant and growing. In 2017 the VRGF estimated that the total social cost of gambling in Victoria was no less than $7 billion, and the figure is certainly higher now. Of that cost, $2.2 billion emerged from family and relationship problems; $1.6 billion emerged from emotional and psychological issues, including suicide and violence; and $1.3 billion emerged from financial losses. What could be more urgent than acting to curtail these costs, especially amid a national cost-of-living crisis that worst affects our most vulnerable, who are also the targets of gambling ads?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the recent steps taken by the opposition to recognise the extent of the problems created by gambling advertising and public concern about its ubiquity, but the evidence indicates that further ring fencing of gambling advertising and merely banning it before, during and after sports broadcasts will not work. The opposition's intent to present its own bill in the other place, diluting much-needed action with very limited bans, is another reason debating the bill I have presented is urgent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last time further restrictions were introduced, by the previous government back in 2017, research undertaken by the Australian Communications and Media Authority found that the total volume of gambling adverts on TV and radio increased by 50 per cent, averaging at 948 individual spots per day. Ads merely travelled into other programming, including sports news, magazine programs, comedy and films, all of which attract young viewers. Do we want to simply reconfirm that mistake?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the scourge of gambling ads either we can commentate or we can act. We can talk about it or we can legislate it now. I thank my fellow crossbenchers for their support and urge the House to support bringing on debate on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Prohibition of Gambling Advertisements) Bill.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  I rise to second the motion. I thank the member for Goldstein for introducing this important private member's bill and I rise to support the suspension of standing orders so that we can debate it immediately.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Problem gambling is an urgent issue in Australia and one that needs an urgent response. We have been elected to this parliament for over one year now. It is conservatively estimated that during that time problem gambling has cost Australia $5 billion. In fiscal terms, the cost to government of the impact of problem gambling would be enough to make it an urgent issue, but the true cost, the real urgency, is the human cost. It's the impacts on families and relationships and on mental health and wellbeing that weigh most heavily on our community and that we must address. UK studies have shown that problem gamblers are three times more likely to consider or attempt suicide. Sixty-eight per cent of people surveyed by the Australian Gambling Research Centre believe that gambling is dangerous for family life. Gambling is making us sick and hurting our most precious relationships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, the escalation of gambling advertising again tells us this parliament needs to address this urgently. The gambling ad spend in Australia has tripled over the last 10 years. Every day almost 1,000 television ads are shown to the Australian community, to our Australian children, and these ads are getting through. A Victorian study found a staggering 31 per cent of 12- to 17-year-olds had gambled at some point in the past and that TV ads for gambling were the most frequently reported type of gambling promotion they had seen, at 73 per cent. These kids aren't even allowed to gamble yet, but almost a third of Victorian young people surveyed had gambled in the past. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our community wants this to stop. The Australian Gambling Research Centre found that 77 per cent of Australians believe there are too many opportunities for gambling nowadays, and 59 per cent believe that gambling should be discouraged. The community has spoken and it's time for the parliament—urgently—to listen. My community in Wentworth wants to see this change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my community members told me that their seven-year-old daughter had asked them what a 'same-day multi' was. A seven-year-old should be discovering the joys of playing team sports, of watching sports with their friends and family, not being educated about the odds and the pay-offs. But this is what is happening with our current advertising regime. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia seeks to be the best in the world at sport. We strive across the sporting codes to do it, but the one code we are absolutely No. 1 at is gambling. Australians are the worst problem gamblers in the entire world. This is a championship that we should not be trying to fight. It is ruining our lives. We must stop this—and stop this urgently—for future generations. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a parent, it's incredibly distressing to see the prevalence of gambling advertising. It's incredibly urgent that we debate this bill today because we owe the Australian people leadership. That is what the purpose of this place is. We must step in. The government must step in and enact regulation and ensure there are protections in place when we have rampant harm occurring. That is what the gambling industry is. Let's call it out for what it actually is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I can draw on my sporting background, in the 1990s we realised that drugs in sport was a major issue, that it had major long-term health harm and implications. And we acted. Governments around the world acted around drugs in sport and gambling harm. But now, let's call it for what it is, gambling is the modern-day drug of sport. It is impacting the health of Australians, and sometimes children as young as 12 are being targeted by gambling advertising. We know it is impacting the enjoyment and participation in sport. It is a harm that is so great to Australians in our community. It is doing immense harm to Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We spend more on gambling, per capita, than any other country—around $1,300 per month. In 2020-21 we lost over $25 billion in gambling. More importantly, we lost loved ones. Families and relationships broke down. People were physically hurt and abused. Mental health suffered. Over a third of Australians gamble in a typical month. The losses are 20 per cent higher than in other countries because of our sports betting advertising regulation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to 1993 you had gambling with the TAB. Then government stepped in. It deregulated and allowed gambling advertising on all sports. What we've seen is this accelerated growth of harm and impact in the community. Sports betting advertising is everywhere. It's on the TV. It's on social media. It targets people. It's on radio, print, jerseys, around the stadiums and is pushed to people non-stop. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're world leaders in gambling, and by urgently debating and passing this bill we can be world leaders in preventing these harms. We did it with tobacco. We led the way. We can do it for gambling. Stop gambling ads now, by debating this bill. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  I rise in support of the suspension of standing orders to debate this bill because gambling companies have sucked hundreds of billions of dollars out of Australian communities and it's getting worse. Figures compiled by the Alliance for Gambling Reform show that Australians gamble 20 per cent more online than any other country in the world, and in 2021 we lost $11.4 billion to pokies. My home state of Queensland has sadly surpassed Victoria as the second-biggest pokie state in the country, with more than $2.7 billion in losses and with residents within the Brisbane City Council local government area losing $591 million in 2021 alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gambling advertising that is saturating our media landscape is harmful and dangerous. It is particularly dangerous for young people, but our governments are doing nothing to stop it. Of course, we welcome the minor steps that have been proposed or taken, whether it's the ban around sporting events or a ban on gambling using credit cards. The Liberal Party have recently suggested some minor changes—ones this Labor government has yet to even engage on—but these are fiddling at the margins when our communities need urgent action. There is a clear reason why the old parties haven't taken action on regulating gambling in advertising. Both the major parties have accepted more than $9 million in donations from the gambling industry over the last two decades. Political donations from the gambling industry amounted to $2.165 million last year alone, which was a 40 per cent increase on the previous year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are the only political party with a clear, comprehensive platform to take action on gambling. We want to see a national gambling regulator to ensure a consistent approach rather than a patchwork of a regulation that gambling companies and casinos can exploit. We want to see a universal and mandatory precommitment system to protect those at risk from gambling harm. We want transparency about the impacts of gambling, starting with clear reporting on which local government areas are hardest hit by the gambling companies. We want a ban on all gambling advertising, including street signage, TV, radio and online ads. Finally, the gambling industry should not be able to sponsor sporting teams and major events. These changes would make a real difference in people's lives.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  I also rise in support of the member's motion to suspend standing orders to debate this bill. Sports wagering is the fastest-growing form of gambling in Australia. Australians lose more than $7 billion to it annually, and the urgency around this debate relates to the fact that, every day, gambling is doing Australians harm. For a lot of people, gambling is a recreational pastime like any other. That's okay—for adults. It's not okay when gambling is being sold to Australian children with reckless abandon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sports gambling has a particular risk. It's so accessible. It's not hidden away in casinos. It's integrated into primetime sporting events that hold real cultural significance for Australians. Every time our kids watch the footy, they see sportspeople who they respect spruiking something which causes our children harm. The sports betting industry spent $280 million on advertising in 2022. Seventy-eight per cent of Australians saw a sports betting ad every week. Forty-one per cent saw more than four every week. During sporting games, on Instagram, on the sides of buses—sports betting ads are everywhere. I have a 14-year-old son who can quote the odds to me. These ads are normalising risky behaviours for our children. And so I do support the member for Goldstein's move to ban all sports betting advertising on TV and radio. I note that this proposal does not include online ads, as they currently are subject to a House committee inquiry, but it's really hard to imagine that online ads are not having a similar adverse effect on our children, as are other forms of sporting advertising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll make one further point. In this place, independents have a strong, proud history of taking new ideas to the table and debating them in a sensible and responsible way. This is politics done differently, and that's what we're doing today. I really urge the major parties to join with this important proposition developed by my colleague the member for Goldstein. This is an important idea which is already gaining a lot of traction with Australian people. It should gain traction with the Australian major parties.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  I'll be brief in my remarks, because I do understand there are more members of the crossbench still wanting to rise to speak. First of all, as is always the case, the government won't support the suspension of standing orders. But, similar to a debate that we had some months ago over the banning of Nazi symbols, where there was a private member's bill sought to be brought on for debate, the fact that we are not supporting the suspension should not be taken as the government being opposed to the principle behind actions that are being sought. I think that's shown in good faith by the Attorney-General introducing the legislation that he did immediately before this debate commenced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue before us now, I want to thank the member for Goldstein for bringing it forward in the way that she has and assure the House that the government is committed to ensuring online gambling takes place within a robust legislative framework with strong consumer protections. Like many Australians, we too as a government are concerned about the extent of gambling ads and their impact, and this is one of the key reasons why the House of Reps inquiry into online gambling and its impact was established—to consider those experiencing gambling harm. That inquiry is due to report in the coming weeks, and its recommendations will underpin the government's consideration of what further reforms are required to reduce gambling harms, including to the rules around gambling advertising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm encouraged by the support for change across the parliament, including the advocacy by all the members that we've heard from so far in the debate. When we do act in this area, we want to make sure that our approach is comprehensive. Importantly, we need to consider the multiple channels over which advertising is delivered, and that includes television, radio, outdoor advertising, branding and, importantly, social media. That's why the government will await the House of Reps inquiry final report before proposing changes.</span>

Thank you very much also to the minister for his comments there about supporting a debate in future about gambling advertising and online gambling. We need to debate this issue urgently. It is currently a public health crisis. The gambling advertising is all pervasive, and there's no escaping it. It's got to a point where it's causing an enormous amount of harm not only to current generations but to future generations too, because we know our children are being exposed to gambling advertising constantly online, on TV and on radio. So, if we don't act now, we have a huge problem coming ahead of us. Yes, it can be the occasional bit of fun for adults, but for many it is actually a destructive lifetime addiction. There's family breakdown; there's domestic violence. It can cause crime; it can cause bankruptcy. It can cause so much harm and, of course, mental ill health that we do need to act now. We can no longer stand by while we allow this toxic environment to flourish.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to tell a little story, just very briefly. My husband was a Brumby back in the 1990s. Back then it seemed more of a wholesome game. There were families, there were children, and they were sponsored by Canberra Milk. Last night, I walked past a life-size cut-out of a Brumby who, smack bang in his middle of his chest, had gambling advertising, and I can't tell you how disappointed I was. Sport has been hijacked by the gambling industry. We can no longer sit and enjoy our leisure time without being targeted and bombarded with gambling advertising, and this is a toxic environment that we are allowing our children to grow up in. Worse than that is the online targeting—the individual targeting of our children with gambling advertisements. The information is mined; it is harvested. They are labelled, and they are individually targeted. Young boys in particular are targeted with gambling advertising. What this means for them in the future I can only wonder. They are preyed upon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now a public health crisis. We need to be building healthy environments for our children, both in the real world physically, while we watch TV or we play sport, and online. We know that our communities are begging us to act. They are begging us to lead on this. Seventy per cent of the public wants to completely ban gambling advertising from TV. We did it with smoking, and now we need to do it with gambling. They are both addictive, harmful products. We need to be world leaders in gambling restrictions and building an environment where our children can flourish again.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  I rise in support of the Trade Loans Amendment Bill 2023. As the minister noted in his second reading speech, since the introduction of trade support loans in 2014, apprentices who've taken advantage of this scheme are 10 per cent more likely to complete their apprenticeships than those who have not. I am also pleased that this government is expanding and revamping the scheme. There will be a new priority list extending the loans not just to apprentices but also to trainees in critical occupations. This means that enrolled nurses, personal care assistants, therapists and dental technicians will be eligible for the first time. This means an end to the existing rules which restrict the program to a limited group of trade occupations, occupations that tend to be dominated by men rather than women. This legislation will extend eligibility to non-trade occupations, and, as the latest data from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research cited by the minister demonstrates, it is the non-trade categories that overwhelmingly attract women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Close to 100,000 women, 95,335 to be precise, as at September last year, are in non-trade apprenticeships and traineeships—that's 76.8 per cent of all the women who are in apprenticeships and traineeships. If this initiative will encourage more women to conclude their courses, that will be for the good, because, in Australia, women remain an underutilised resource. Recent data from a partnership between Chief Executive Women and Impact Economics and Policy found that increasing women's participation in the paid workforce would address Australia's current skills shortage and have a long-lasting impact on productivity. The study found that engaging women in paid work at the same rate as men could unlock an additional one million full-time skilled workers. Grattan Institute data also estimates that a six per cent increase in female workforce participation would add $25 billion to Australia's GDP. As Grattan's Danielle Wood noted in her keynote address to the Jobs and Skills Summit last year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… if untapped women's workforce participation was a massive ore deposit, we would have governments lining up to give tax concessions to get it out of the ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will keep repeating that quote to ensure that it lands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation appears to be one small step in the right direction. In its original incarnation, it encouraged more apprentices to complete their qualifications. I see every reason why these measures will provide further support and encouragement. Importantly, it's designed to encourage more women to enter and complete those qualifications. Equally importantly, the new priority list will have the flexibility to include occupations in early childhood education, aged and disability care. These are all areas of priority and where we have significant shortfalls in the number of qualified workers that we need. But, when it comes to women, we must also not forget what are termed 'traditional trades'. Completion rates for women in construction and building trades are lower than for men in many cases because women find the workplaces an unfriendly, unwelcoming environment. These are factors that we, as a parliament and a society, still need to address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also develop a strategy to channel women and girls into the industries that will emerge from the coming renewables revolution. If we do not, we will have yet another hi-vis male-dominated trades based sector that is neither attractive nor indeed safe for women. Girls care about climate, and they want to do something. It is up to us to channel their enthusiasm into what will be a thriving sector with well-paid, secure jobs. Women and girls deserve a slice of that cake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also understand that this legislation has attracted the attention of the education minister, who is interested in seeing whether it can be applied to other areas of higher education beyond the vocational education and training sector. The indications are that, for women, especially unpaid placements as part of their nursing and teacher training, it can be particularly challenging, leading to what is being dubbed 'placement poverty' as they're forced to give up paid work to do their on-the-job training. This can lead to people well through their qualification period giving up simply because they need money now just to get by. I hope the education minister can find a way to adapt this successful and now expanding program to his areas of responsibility.</span>

                    <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  It just doesn't matter where you are in Australia—whether you're in a major metropolitan city or a small regional town, every industry is struggling to find skilled and available workers. This is especially acute in the care sectors, with even more effects in smaller regional centres. Whether it's aged-care facilities desperate for workers, the local early education centre chasing new staff or NDIS providers trying to find skilled workers, there is a drastic skill shortage, which has been perpetuated by the former government, who sat on their hands and did little but make announcements rather than actually trying to fix it. Unlike the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments, the Albanese Labor government is committed to taking meaningful action to address the urgent skills crisis. We're already well underway when it comes to the hard work required to address the major issue. We permanently established Jobs and Skills Australia. We invested in fee-free TAFE and providing more places in universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023 continues this critical work by introducing measures to facilitate the expansion of the longstanding trade support loans program and make it fairer for more Australian apprentices. The amendments will make loans available to Australian apprentices in the priority non-trade sector for the first time, including female dominated apprenticeships. This is in clear contrast to the previous government, who had every opportunity and put up and left the barriers, keeping women out of the workforce or from advancing in their careers. The Albanese Labor government, in contrast, has been on the front foot since its election last year to tear down some of these barriers that affect women's participation in the workforce, whether it was by introducing the 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave, making child care cheaper or implementing our gender equality agenda for jobs and wages, including bringing transparency of pay to workplaces so that we know what goes on and measure it, and then we can improve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments and the widening of the availability of the trade support loans scheme will address the national skills shortage as well as getting more skilled women into the workforce. It's crucial that the expanded and fairer eligibility scheme in the amendments is in place to allow all apprentices in priority occupations to access additional support through this income-contingent loan. It's a scheme that helps them to meet their day-to-day living costs while they train. It also helps incentivise them to complete their training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade support loans are an interest-free income-contingent government loan to support Australian apprentices to meet their everyday expenses while they undertake an apprenticeship. Eligible apprentices can access monthly loans up to a total of $22,890 over the life of their apprenticeship. Available loan amounts are tapered over the life of the apprenticeship, with levels of financial support front-loaded to the start of the apprenticeship in recognition of the low wages in the first few years. As at the end of March this year, more than 167,000 apprentices have taken up a trade support loan since the scheme was introduced in July 2014. That's a total of $1.5 billion paid in loan instalments to eligible apprentices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments seek to enhance access to income-contingent loans for apprentices and trainees under the Trade Support Loans Act 2014. These amendments will help more apprentices to meet their daily living costs as well as improve the administration of the scheme. I'll set out the amendments and what they'll do. They'll expand eligibility for the loans to include all Australian apprentices working in priority occupations, including those in non-trade occupations for the first time. This may include occupations in aged care, child care and disability care—three crucial areas in our economy. We'll rebrand the loan scheme from 'trade support loans' to 'Australian apprenticeship support loans' to reflect this expanded eligibility, and we'll improve flexibility to backdate trade support loan payments to provide immediate support to apprentices and avoid the potential for apprentices to miss a payment due to administrative error.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many people, when you hear the word 'apprentice', your mind immediately turns to plumbers, sparkies, carpenters and such—what we sometimes call the traditional trades. However, we need to move away from thinking that apprenticeships are for traditional trades only. I'm not having a go at my sister the electrician, my nephews the carpenters or my nephew the plumber. It is 2023, and we need to realise help is required for people entering non-trade occupations such as aged care, child care and disability care. They deserve the same access to assistance as those typically male-dominated traditional trades. And how important are these jobs! These are the people who are caring for our children, our elderly and those with a disability—surely one of the most crucial things we can have someone do. So it is no surprise that many of these non-trade priority occupations are typically female dominated. As I said before, unlike the previous government, we support women in employment, and this change is expected to boost support for women's participation in those fields. This delivers access to additional financial assistance—no longer limited to trade occupations—and will provide ongoing flexibility for the program to support apprentices in industries when and where it is needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The priority list will replace the current trade support loans priority list to better align eligibility to occupations with an apprenticeship pathway in areas of identified current and future skills needs. The priority list will be kept current by continuing to be based on the latest Skills Priority List work, which has now become a part of the role of Jobs and Skills Australia. In updating the priority list, the minister will have the benefit of relying on the latest advice from Jobs and Skills Australia on Australia's current and emerging labour market and the skills most required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will mean that, amid rises in the cost of living, more people can access immediate financial support to help them complete apprenticeships or traineeships, leading to occupations in Australian workforce sectors that are currently experiencing skills shortages. This will help to address those shortages and deliver workers for a stronger Australian economy. The amendments align the trade support loan scheme with the Australian Apprenticeships Incentive System, which came into effect on 1 July last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also enable the backdating of payments to provide immediate support to apprentices where missed payments might have resulted from an admin error, as I mentioned earlier. Currently there is no discretion to provide backdated payments, so an apprentice who didn't receive a payment due to a simple admin error would just miss out. As anyone who knows apprenticeship wages, there's not much fat in the wages for an apprentice. This is not fair, and this bill will fix that problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In line with the existing trade support loan program, and to encourage completions, Australian apprentices who successfully complete their apprenticeship will continue to have access to a 20 per cent discount on the amount of the loan they need to repay. This incentive to complete the apprenticeship will continue under the more widely accessible Australian apprenticeships support loan scheme. It will encourage even more people to finish their apprenticeships. Sadly, for the past decade or so, they've been starting but not completing their apprenticeships. So all these reforms complement the establishment of Jobs and Skills Australia, which is the permanent, independent body responsible for providing advice to government to underpin our response to current, emerging and future labour market and workforce skills and training needs to improve employment opportunities and economic growth. This is important because, if you don't get that training right, productivity can be halted or can freeze.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobs and Skills Australia is a central part of our commitment to cement tripartism as the foundation for the VET system, driving a partnership approach to forecasting and planning for Australia's skills needs with governments, employers, unions and the training and education sector all working in the national interest. It's working closely with state and territory governments as well as employers, trade unions and training providers to ensure a shared understanding of the key issues facing Australia's labour market today and in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Expanding eligibility for the new Australian apprenticeship support loans scheme will allow the government to leverage the expertise of Jobs and Skills Australia to identify those emerging skills needs and better target government assistance in a timely manner. Apprenticeships are the key to delivering the pipeline of skilled workers that Australia needs. However, we must lift that completion rate and increase diversity in our apprenticeship cohort to realise this skills pipeline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes have seen consultation with both the Australian Taxation Office, who manage the loan repayments under the act, and the Australian Apprenticeship Support Network, our providers who support the delivery and administration of the apprenticeship support programs. Of course, this supplements all of the other work that the Albanese government is doing to meet the skills and labour shortages in Australia, including committing at the Jobs and Skills Summit to the reformation of the apprenticeship support system and committing, through the May budget, to a strengthened Australian apprenticeship support service delivery model that will place the apprentice right at the centre. It will rebalance non-financial supports over the life of an apprenticeship, strengthen wraparound supports and continue to build the skilled workforce that industry needs. These trade support loans amendments will complement our reform work and the Albanese government's focus on completions by providing another avenue of financial support to a broader range of apprentices and trainees. This will help more apprentices with cost-of-living pressures while they train.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Year-on-year completion rates have been in decline, and the apprenticeship system remains heavily gender biased, with women comprising only 31 per cent of all apprentices in training. I have a sister who is an electrician, and I remember when she was applying to be an apprentice that one of the old electricians said, 'You wouldn't be able to carry a large ladder across a ploughed field.' She said, 'Why would I want to carry a large ladder across a ploughed field? I'd drive it over in a ute.' She's now a brilliant electrician. So we know that there's some gender bias. In particular, women remain underrepresented in male dominated trades such as plumbing, carpentry and being electricians, where they make up just over eight per cent of all trade apprentices. It's also clear that current arrangements are not serving First Nations apprentices, whose overall completion rate is, on average, six per cent lower than other apprentices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite there being a record number of trade apprentices currently in training, the proportion of apprentices completing their apprenticeship has been in steady decline since 2013. This is a trend we need to see improve, and these practical changes to financial support will deliver better outcomes for all industries and for the nation, both in traditional trades and in non-trade occupations. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  The coalition will be supporting these bills—the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill and the Student Loans (Overseas Debtors Repayment Levy) Amendment Bill—as we've heard. They are sensible reforms which the coalition developed whilst in government, starting these reforms, as we've heard from previous speakers. I encourage all the great young people out there—and those of all ages—to take up apprenticeships, and I hope that these measures assist you in your efforts and help you to complete what you're doing. We have an enduring commitment to apprenticeships and training not just because of skills shortages but because apprenticeships have helped set up so many Australians for life. That early training has seen them go on and become very, very successful in life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look back at our history in government during the pandemic, we made sure that we protected apprenticeships and apprentices with the wage subsidy measures and we supported jobseekers and young people to be able to get skills for the jobs of the future with low-fee or fee-free training through the JobTrainer Fund. That included 48,000 places in aged-care training, as well. We committed over $13 billion to the skills sector during the pandemic. It was very important that we retained the connection between apprentices, workers and employers at that time. We supported over 530,000 apprentices and trainees through those wage subsidies when the pandemic hit. That support was very significant, reaching over $7.9 billion. We delivered a record 240,000 trade apprentices in training, which was the highest since 1963, and we invested $2.4 billion to upskill apprentices in streamlining the new Australian Apprentices Incentive System.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is just part of what we did during our time in government, particularly during COVID, but we also supported small businesses to invest in the skills of their employees and train new ones through the Skills and Training Boost, which was also very useful to small businesses and to apprentices and trainees. The National Skills Commission provided expert advice, and we created the National Careers Institute to improve careers advice across the tertiary sector. But we cannot underestimate the importance of apprenticeships and traineeships. As I said, we started these reforms in government. Like in the majority of Australia, skill shortages are a real challenge in my electorate of Forrest, in the south-west of WA, whether you're talking machinery operators, technical or trade roles, community and personal services, or retail and hospitality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Forrest electorate is in the top five electorates in the country in terms of the proportion of technicians and trade workers. The latest census figures show that more than 13,400 technicians and trade workers are in my electorate of Forrest. It's also the case that four of the nation's top five electorates for this category are actually in Western Australia, my home state. The very diversity of the economy in the south-west is reflected in the high number of people also working in community and personal services categories, in labouring, as machinery operators and as drivers. I am always inordinately impressed with the naturally talented, manually skilled young people, in particular, that I meet. There's nothing they can't fix and there's no problem they're not prepared to take on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over many decades, the businesses in the south-west have built their workforces through apprenticeships and traineeships—whether it's a multinational or right through to the smallest of small businesses engaged in any group training program, or just as an individual business. One of the largest in scale, in both the south-west and Peel regions, is Alcoa. I think they've trained more than 2,500 apprentices, trainees and graduates since they began operating in our part of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other significant local businesses who are genuinely and continuously invested in training their staff. One that comes to mind is Piacentini &amp; Son, a major mining contracting business in my electorate. They've got 63 apprentices across the trades of heavy diesel mechanic, the boilermaker-welder space, auto electrical and 240-volt electrical. They have seven dedicated trainers for their mobile plant operators alone. That's a massive commitment to training and developing their staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is a real challenge for companies like Piacentini &amp; Son. They make a huge commitment, but know they are going to lose a significant number of these very well trained people into the mining and resources sector. This is something that happens continuously in regional parts of WA. For those who are prepared to get involved in fly-in fly-out work there are certainly very attractive salary packages. It is a continuing frustration for the companies and small businesses in my region who are delivering so much of that high quality training to their apprentices and trainees. They need the people that they're training in their own businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also see companies like Simcoa, in my part of the world. They are a world class silicon producer. They have six apprentices covering the mechanical and electrical trades. The softwood sawmiller Westpine Industries has around 10 apprentices and trainees. A major local builder of nearly 60 years in business, Perkins Builders, with their head office in Bunbury and premises in Perth, have four apprentices in the carpentry trade, plus administration trainees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at what this has done to the fabric of our communities, particularly in rural and regional areas. Even though we're now seeing some of the highest vacancy rates for apprenticeships, I look and see just what it's done to help our small regional communities. I look at a couple of young guys who started as apprentices in the building trade for a company called Newby Building Contractors in Harvey. They were brothers, Peter and Russell Willmott. They did their apprenticeships, and later their business became Willmott Constructions. They took on apprentices of their own, built some fantastic premises and did great work around the south-west, particularly around Harvey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The value of the apprenticeship is that it sets you up for life. You'll see these young people often going on and starting or owning their own small business and becoming a key part of making sure that, in the regional and rural areas, we still have access to all the services and supports we need in our regions. We've got Jones Welding Solutions. Luke and Zane Jones have six apprentices in engineering and fabrication, which is what they do. They offer a 24/7 breakdown service for their customers. They've won so many small-business awards and electrical trades awards, because they look after their teams so well and do their jobs so well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I see a young woman who came through, Ester Italiano, in Harvey. She started as an apprentice in the local hairdressing salon and now she owns that business, and she's employing others and providing apprenticeships. So there's this intergenerational work that goes on, starting with the first person who gives you an opportunity, even as a small business, as an apprentice. Nixon Electrics is another one that is intergenerational in my part of the world and is now run by David Faulkner. He and the Nixon Electrics crew have won a number of awards as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Down in Bustleton there's Ray Mounteney, who has a car dealership. He has a very long history in the industry. He has nine light-vehicle apprentices, right now, supplied by three different Group Training Organisations. He spoke about some of the challenges when you're a  trainer of apprentices, the demands in his car dealership space of fast-moving technology and the requirement for ongoing training beyond that initial trade qualification, keeping apprentices, trainees and workers up to date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ray also touched on that constant loss of trades people to the mining sector. We often see this happening, in my part of the world, across the board. As well there is the cost to the business itself—in training their own apprentices, in the loss of productivity of the other skilled workers who are supervising, instructing and working with the apprentices, putting that time and effort in to help them be the best they can be. Often the auto industry is not necessarily viewed as a career or for potential development, when, in fact, it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many reasons why some businesses find it difficult to take on and train apprentices themselves. At the moment, with the constant increases in costs of inputs, the labour shortages and supply chain constraints this makes that even more challenging. So many small businesses are working overtime just to keep their businesses running. With these skills shortages, some of them don't have anyone in the business with the skills and time to support the training and manage all of the compliance issues. I know in Ray's business they are working very hard on a team-building approach, tracking and retaining people from a diversity of ages and gender, and creating the workplace that people want to be in, in that business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also look at the Harvey agriculture school in my patch. They offer a range of trades within that ag school, whether it's in agriculture, construction, metals, engineering or furniture. When I go to one of their graduations, these young people have often already been placed. They get a very good traineeship at the ag school and they become very attractive to the business sector and often find themselves employed before the end of their time. They develop those industry skills and experiences. They get that hands-on training. Through an apprenticeship, they can get their nationally recognised qualifications. When you're doing this sort of work, you're networking with the industry that you want to be engaged in from day one, and you're developing knowledge and confidence and that intergenerational transfer of skills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember when my brother was a mechanic and worked in our little home town of Brunswick Junction. It was the mature-aged men, at that time, who had vast experience in the industry, who were so keen to pass on what they had learned over a lifetime to my brother, Lindsay, as an apprentice. He carried those skills with him into business, in the contracting, earth-moving and cartage sector. Such was his training that in later life he was able to build himself a fantastic dragcar, from the chassis up, and was able to do that quarter mile in under 6½ seconds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many job and life opportunities for people who take up apprenticeships. I want to encourage people who are considering this, even young people. In the rural and regional areas, there are some very, very good opportunities for young people and people of all ages. I encourage you to take up these opportunities, no matter what stage you are at in life, because whatever you learn through that apprenticeship in those early years will sustain you throughout your life and your career. I encourage anyone with an interest in this space or who is thinking that this might be for them to take up that opportunity and take on an apprenticeship. I'm sure the businesses will assist you to get you to where you need to be.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  I rise today to contribute to the debate on the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023 and the associated bill. Education is vital for everyone. We as a country regularly brag about how proud we are of our world-class education system. But, as I've said in this place before, years 11 and 12 and university studies aren't the only types of education will that create opportunities. Years 11 and 12 and university are just not for some people. I will proudly say that I was one of those people. I didn't do year 11 or year 12. In fact, I didn't even make it to year 10, and I certainly didn't go to university, but my life has turned out pretty well, and I have been able to receive, and make the most of, all the opportunities I could have dreamt of. This is because I got a trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While being in a classroom and writing essays wasn't for me, using my hands was, and this is the case for hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of people around Australia. We are a government that wants to support people like me to access the sort of life-changing education and training that is suited to them. We want to ensure that Australians from all backgrounds and cultures are supported to achieve their full potential, and this bill is critical to continuing this work. Trades are so valuable and so very important, but so are other skills, such as those used in the care sector and other occupations that are predominantly taken up by women. That is why this bill will expand the trade support loan program to non-trade occupations for the first time. Not only are these skill sets important for people better suited to working with their hands than working in an office but they are also important for our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tradies are cool. We need tradies, and we need workers in the care sector. We need all of the skills that will be supported by the bill. Right now in this country, we are facing the most significant skills shortage in decades. I know this because I was the manager of an engineering shop. I saw how hard it was to get apprentices, and I saw how hard it was to keep them. The measures in this bill are a practical way that we can extend financial support to more apprentices and trainees. Australian apprenticeship support loans will support them to continue and to complete their qualifications so they can get a good job in areas that are crying out for more workers. Sectors with skills shortages can't get more qualified workers until more apprentices and trainees finish their apprenticeships and traineeships. This bill is good for trainees and apprentices and is good for our country. This is a government that supports all of the skills that this country needs to operate and move forward, and we support the apprentices training and learning these most important skills. This program needs to be expanded so that nobody is left behind, and that's what we are doing. To reflect this, the program will be renamed Australian apprenticeship support loans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade support loans are absolute gold for apprentices. They are an interest-free, income-contingent government loan to support Australian apprentices to meet their everyday expenses while they undertake an apprenticeship. We need those who start their training to go through with it and become qualified. To encourage this, those who complete their training will receive a 20 per cent discount on their loan. Eligible apprentices are able to access a maximum of $22,890 throughout their apprenticeship, which is paid by monthly payments. The loans are tapered throughout an apprenticeship. As an apprentice becomes more skilled, they become more valuable and are paid more, so the highest payments of this loan are at the start of the apprenticeship to reflect lower wages early in an apprenticeship. Since 2014, these payments have already helped over 167,000 apprentices who may have otherwise struggled to complete their apprenticeship. But with the changes we are making under this bill to make the system fairer and more effective I hope this number will skyrocket. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current trade support loans priority list is limited to apprentices in traditional trades, but our skills shortages span far wider than that. Areas like early childhood education, aged care and disability care are experiencing severe shortages too, but trainees in these sectors can't currently access the support that is available to those in traditional trades. Without support for the people to be able to finish their apprenticeships and traineeships in these areas, how can we expect the skill shortages to ever ease? It makes sense for the program to be expanded to all areas of the skills shortage, and that's what we're doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Non-trade apprenticeships are dominated by women, with 76.8 per cent of women apprentices and trainees in non-trade occupations such as childcare, retail, administration and hospitality. That's 95,335 women. Women who choose to undertake an apprenticeship or traineeship should be able to access the same support as those in male dominated trades. This change is expected to boost support for women's continued participation in the workforce and provide equal support for apprentices and traineeships historically undertaken by women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the skills Australia needs are always changing, and the sector which is experiencing the biggest shortage of skills changes too. To make sure that nobody misses out on the support they need, the new Australian apprenticeships priority list will be determined at least annually and will be expanded to occupations that have access to the program, including non-trade occupations. This will give flexibility to open the financial support to occupations in the high skills needed in the care sector such as enrolled nurses, personal care assistants and therapists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a strong focus on modernising and rebuilding our vocational education system. We have a lot of work to do, but we have already made a lot of progress. We are delivering 180,000 free TAFE positions in 2023 and a further 300,000 places to become fee-free from 2024. This bill and the new Australian apprenticeship support loans program will continue with our work and focus to help Australia and Australians meet our current and future skills needs. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also established Jobs and Skills Australia, which is a permanent independent body responsible for providing advice to government to underpin Australia's response to current, emerging and future labour market and workforce skills and training needs, to improve employment opportunities and economic growth. The benefits of this are already being shown with this bill. In determining the new Australian apprenticeships priority list, the bill requires the minister to have regard to the advice of Jobs and Skills Australia. This will help make sure that the priority list is reflective of the current, emerging and future skills and training needs in the workforce so that we avoid getting into the position that we're currently in, with a broken vocational education system and skill shortages in important sectors. We said we would have a focus on jobs and skills, and that is what we are delivering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Doing a trade can be tough, and it takes time to be qualified and earning a full income. It's even harder now with the cost-of-living pressures that are facing so many Australians, but business needs employees, and the cost of living should not be a factor in whether or not someone decides to enter into an apprenticeship. It disappoints me to think that some decide to stop their apprenticeship because it's just too hard financially. This bill is providing another avenue of financial support to a broader range of apprentices and trainees and will help more apprentices with the cost-of-living pressures while they train and ensure more apprentices enter jobs which are crying out for apprentices. It means that apprentices can go and do their training without struggling financially and receive all of the rewards that come with being qualified at the end of their apprenticeship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by saying something to the people in my electorate of Hunter, especially young people who may be trying to work out what they want to do with their lives. University is amazing, and it's easier to access than in the past, which is great. But if it doesn't sound like it's for you—if you want to use your hands and build things in a trade, or if you have a passion for caring for others—choosing an apprenticeship or a traineeship is a good, solid pathway for you that will pay you while you learn your skills. It will give you the opportunities to set yourself and your family up for the future. Now, regardless of what area you want to get into, there is support available to you. So go and chase what you're interested in, chase a future that you'll enjoy. I did it, and I wouldn't change a thing, because tradies are cool.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I rise today in support of the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023. This bill aims to expand the list of apprentices that are eligible for trade support loans. These loans provide almost $23,000 to an apprentice who is completing their qualification in a traditional trade. Apprentices who successfully complete their qualification receive a 20 per cent reduction in their loan obligations to further encourage them to finish their apprenticeship. This bill means that the list of occupations eligible for the loan will now be expanded to other areas where we're experiencing skills shortages—areas like early childhood education, aged care and disability care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This type of support is so important for people who are getting trained to fill our workforce gaps. Data from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations shows that recipients of these loans are more likely to complete their apprenticeship. Completion rates are about 10 per cent higher for those who've taken out a loan than for those who haven't. These loans help with the cost of living while people are on low pay at the beginning of their apprenticeships. Things like groceries, petrol, getting to work and paying rent are key cost-of-living issues. We know how hard it is for students to train or study and earn a living at the same time, so I support this bill as one step towards supporting people to get skilled up in the areas that are needed most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everywhere I go in my electorate of Indi, it is jobs and skills shortages that people tell me about, whether they are constituents from businesses, organisations, hospitality or whatever. Across the board in our regional centres, our bustling tourist hotspots and our small towns, employers are struggling to find staff. Job ads go unanswered or the staff available don't have the required skills. There are also notable times when employers find someone who's willing to take up a job but finds it impossible to find somewhere to live. This is happening again and again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Workforce challenges in rural, regional and remote Australia are different to those faced in the metropolitan areas. In Indi the unemployment rate is below the already historically low national unemployment rate. People aren't talking to me about creating jobs; they're talking to me about filling jobs. The lack of workers is dampening our productivity. It's forcing restaurants to leave tables empty due to a lack of staff, or businesses to knock back clients because they know they can't fulfil orders. The quarterly update released last month by Jobs and Skills Australia found that skills shortages are particularly persistent in regional areas, more so than in metropolitan areas. JSA identified cooks, chefs, electricians and early childhood educators as some of the greatest areas of need. I hear about skills shortages in these important occupations all the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">High-quality, accessible early childhood education and care is an essential service in a community where we want maximum workforce participation. For parents, it allows them to work, to train, to study—to open doors; for children, it keeps them safe and healthy and is crucial to their development. But in regional and rural Australia we are really struggling to find a childcare workforce. In Indi we've experienced the threat of closure in several small towns where the market is thin and the childcare workers are just so scarce. Each month, parents write to me about how hard it is to find a childcare placement for their child. They tell me this means they're delaying going back to work. Many of them are critical healthcare workers such as psychologists, doctors, nurses and pharmacists, not to mention logistics supply people and all the other people we have in our regions. The lack of available places is actually severely compounding the problem of essential worker shortages in Indi. In Wangaratta, some children have been on the waitlist for 18 months along with 100 other families. In Bright, there's a 70-child waitlist. In Wodonga, families have their children on waitlists at 10 or more centres, and they still can't get a spot. Working parents are forced to quit their jobs—I'm not exaggerating—or reduce their hours because there are just not enough childcare places. This is simply because we do not have enough educators. One educator in Wangaratta who has worked in the sector since 1994 tells me she has never seen the level of educators so low.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will help support people studying to be early childhood educators—the childhood educators we so badly need—but so much more needs to be done in addition to that. A longer-term agreement aimed at driving sector reform and supporting women's workforce participation is still being negotiated by the government, and I sincerely hope that growing the childcare workforce is directly addressed by this agreement. I also call on the government to fully implement the National Children's Education and Care Workforce Strategy, which seeks to address recruitment, retainment and sustainability of the childcare workforce. I also welcome the upcoming comprehensive review by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on child care. I look forward to reading their findings and recommendations and working with the government to see them fulfilled. I am looking at the minister right now, and I really want to work with you on this to solve this intractable problem that we have right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like early childhood educators, we also have a shortage of aged-care and disability care workers. Health care and social assistance are actually the largest occupation in my electorate of Indi, hiring over 11,000 people, but between June 2020 and March 2023, job vacancies for carers and aides went up a whopping 412 per cent in my electorate—a staggering figure of 412 per cent. The workforce shortages in this area are stark. Across Indi, aged-care facilities tell me how incredibly hard it is to attract the much-needed workforce just to keep their doors open. Without an adequate workforce, facilities go under, and the consequences are felt right across the community. A major employer is lost, a skilled workforce is gutted, and families don't have a facility nearby to care for their mother, father, husband, wife, friend, neighbour or loved one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The disability care workforce in regional Australia is also lacking. The NDIS National Workforce Plan released in 2021 projects that regional Australia will need an additional 90,000 workers by 2024 to meet demand, but it acknowledged that longer vacancy times and smaller applicant pools make it particularly challenging to attract workers into regional communities. So we need to continue providing incentives for people to train in our caring professions, and I look forward to working more with the Minister for Skills and Training about what we can do to address the severe lack in such critical occupations in our rural, regional and remote areas in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After health and social assistance, construction the next major employer in my electorate of Indi. According to statistics provided by the Master Builders Association, in Indi we have over 7,000 people employed in building and construction. According to the Victorian Skills Authority, construction is also our third-highest area for additional workforce, requiring an additional 1,100 full-time equivalent workers over the coming years. Trade support loans were originally intended for technician and trade apprenticeships like plumbers, builders and electricians. I support the bill's expansion of who can access support loans beyond these traditional areas, but let's not forget how critical supporting apprentices in these trade areas is. With demand for more housing like we have not seen for decades—maybe not since the Second World War, actually—these plumbers, builders and electricians are going to be the ones that build the houses we desperately need for other essential workers like childcare workers, doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. Unfortunately, we are experiencing a shortage in trade skills too. One builder in my electorate says that he's never seen such a shortage of skilled practitioners in his 40 years of industry experience. He says that, in the regions, this shortage is acute and is absolutely directly affecting their capacity to address the housing crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that the government is carrying forward the previous government's budget measure that provides additional funding to increase the list of apprentices eligible for loans. We can't scale back support for apprentices in our trade sectors at a time like this, and I'm glad that the government has recognised this. But, like all student loans right now, these Australian apprenticeship support loans are also facing a 7.1 per cent indexation. This is the highest indexation rate in more than three decades. A HECS loan will go up by an average of $1,760 a year with this indexation, and many in my region are now looking at their qualifications as, indeed, a lifetime debt burden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill, people studying early childhood education, disability and aged care—people who are mostly women—will benefit most from the expanded student loan plan. But it will mean that they, too, will be saddled with another debt, and this debt burden is particularly hard right now when we're facing a cost-of-living crisis. The government has powers to fix these crippling student debts. I urge them to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that the government is investing in other skills and training opportunities by delivering, since January, 180,000 fee-free TAFE and vocational education places. Last month, the government announced that 33 per cent of these places taken up so far are in regional and rural areas. I am so pleased to read that statistic. Again, we know the workforce gaps in regional Australia are worse than in urban areas. The uptake of these TAFE places is further evidence of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, Goulburn Ovens TAFE—or, as we call it, GOTAFE—in Wangaratta and Wodonga TAFE are training people up to work in our local construction and electrical businesses, aged-care homes and childcare centres. Wodonga TAFE CEO Phil Paterson says that fee-free TAFE has been an outstanding success for local students embarking on new careers, returning to work or making a career change. He says that fee-free TAFE and the expansion of trade support loans remove barriers to locals pursuing in-demand careers, like early childhood education and disability care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm pleased about the government's increased support for vocational training, like we see under this bill, we need to do a whole lot more to keep supporting our TAFEs. Phil Paterson observes seeing more and more students without the numeracy and literacy skills to complete vocational education. We need to adequately fund our TAFEs that are providing this type of vital enabling education and training. We also need to see more support to upgrade TAFEs infrastructure. We simply can't take on skills developments in rural and regional TAFEs for these jobs while we have 1970s infrastructure. When I visit these TAFEs, as I do very regularly, I see passionate educators and dedicated students. I see a lot of hope, but I also see ageing infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wodonga TAFE is already making a great start on upgrading infrastructure. Only last week I attended the opening of their newest facility, the Trades Training Centre, funded by both the Commonwealth and the state governments. This impressive multilevel building on the Wodonga TAFE campus incorporates state-of-the-art classrooms, the latest specialist equipment and hands-on practical workspaces to train the next plumbers, carpenters, cabinetmakers, electrotechnologists and others. Wodonga TAFE also has a fantastic partnership with the Australian Defence Force to train defence personnel in these vital trades. They're benefiting from these new facilities. So I congratulate CEO Phil Patterson, board chair Allison Jenvy and all of the board and staff on this incredible achievement. I hope to see similar infrastructure built right across regional areas into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobs and Skills Australia, or JSA, are going to be a critical part of advising government on future ways to build and support our workforce. It will be advising government on which occupations should be eligible for the Australian apprenticeship support loans. I was very pleased to work with the Minister for Skills and Training to amend the JSA bill to ensure that one of JSA's functions is to analyse skills and workforce needs in regional, rural and remote Australia. When JSA's work becomes publicly available, I will be closely following what recommendations it makes to government to address the workforce needs, specifically in regional Australia. I'll make sure the government continues to take up these JSA recommendations so that we can hopefully start to see an improvement in regional workforce shortages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this bill as a measure towards helping people complete their qualifications in the areas where we need them most, but we can't lose sight of the unique needs and opportunities in regional Australia in developing labour markets, skills and training needs. In Indi we are passionate about developing the workforce for the future. I speak to employers, educators, apprentices, trainees, young people who are starting their careers and older people who want to rejoin the workforce. Let's keep working together, let's collaborate, let's be clever and let's make sure that we support these people to get the skills and qualifications they need and we need.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Indi for her contribution to this debate. As I was sitting here listening to what she was talking about, it struck me that what she's really talking about is the interconnectedness of all these issues, particularly for rural and regional Australians, whom we both have the great privilege of representing—I in Tasmania and she in Indi. Pay, conditions, access to amenities for partners and children, telecommunications, housing and opportunities are interconnected issues that require a range of policy responses to address. For example, you can't get nurses in remote areas if they can't get internet, because they want to be able to watch the shows that they enjoy and also stay connected to family, such as by catching up with the kids who may be living in the city while they're working in the bush. It's things like that that the government is cognisant of and is addressing—things like fee-free TAFE, which I'm pleased the member for Indi acknowledged. She's given feedback on how well it's going. It's a terrific endorsement of the government's policy, and I thank the Minister for Skills and Training for leading this. Four hundred and eighty thousand Australians are taking advantage of fee-free TAFE. The Housing Australia Future Fund, which we're still hopeful of getting a solution on in the Senate, will deliver 30,000 homes across Australia over the next five years. On regional internet rollout, the minister's doing a terrific job getting regional internet rolling out. And, of course, there is the 15 per cent aged-care pay rise that the government announced in the budget. It's all interconnected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm on my feet today to talk about another terrific endorsement. We are talking about the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023, which will expand access to income-contingent loans for Australian apprentices. This is a bipartisan initiative, so I thank the opposition for their support for this. The bill broadens the eligibility criteria for trade support loans, making the system fairer and more inclusive by addressing key issues and decision points. In doing so, we foster a stronger apprenticeship system that better supports apprentices across various occupations and helps bridge that national skills gap that we hear so much about. It's something that will benefit apprentices across Australia, especially in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill extends the eligibility for income-contingent loans to all Australian apprentices working in priority occupations, including those in the non-trade care sectors such as aged care, child care and disability care. We've said it before and we'll say it again: there is a tsunami of need across these three critical areas—aged care, child care and disability care. We desperately need workforce in these areas, particularly in rural and regional Australia. There are great opportunities out there, but it must be said that the United Workers Union did a survey recently. They had 7,000 respondents to this survey of their members in, I think, early child care—early learning I think it's called now, and the minister, I'm sure, will correct me—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, apprentices in trade occupations have access to these loans, while those in non-trade priority occupations face financial challenges without similar support. This amendment rectifies the disparity and provides that much-needed financial assistance to apprentices in what are largely female dominated industries. By doing so, we anticipate that we'll work in women's participation in these fields, addressing gender imbalances and empowering more individuals to pursue what we hope will be rewarding careers. What's more, expanding eligibility for income-contingent loans will encourage higher participation in apprenticeships across priority non-trade occupations in the care sector, effectively addressing a significant national skill shortage. This amendment provides apprentices with greater financial security, increasing their chances of completing their apprenticeship successfully. There is a drop-off rate between those who start apprenticeships and those who finish, and hopefully this will close that gap. Indeed, apprentices who successfully complete their apprenticeship will be entitled to a 20 per cent discount on the loan amount they need to repay, incentivising completion and rewarding their hard work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does a trade loan look like? For example, an apprentice in Bridgewater in my electorate can access monthly loans up to a total of $22,890 over the life of the apprenticeship to help offset the cost of everyday living and help them gain access to equipment they may need or want to purchase to help them to complete their apprenticeship. The loans are interest free and are repaid through the Australian tax system once you reach the minimal threshold, being $48,361. Think of it as HECS for tradies or HECS for apprentices. I know the member for Indi has mentioned the rising debt because they are pegged to inflation. There is no interest applied, but the loan amount is pegged to inflation so that taxpayers aren't on the hook for movements in CPI. The loan can go up over time, but it must be stressed: the repayment doesn't. The repayment is contingent on your income, not on the loan amount. People can choose to pay the loan off quicker if they choose to do so, but, if not, they can pay it off according to their income. That's different to the loans most of us have. In a cost-of-living crunch our repayments go up as the interest rates go up. That doesn't apply to these loans. They are contingent on your income. That's an important point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to expanding eligibility, the bill proposes an increase in the loan amount available to apprentices. This takes into account the rising cost of living and training expenses, enabling apprentices to cover their financial commitments more effectively. By providing adequate financial support, we can alleviate some of the financial burdens faced by apprentices and create a conducive environment for them to focus on their training and skill development. Instead of worrying about whether they've got the money, the loan is there. It's a burden they don't need, and they can focus on their skills and training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill recognises the need to support apprentices from diverse backgrounds. To ensure inclusivity, the bill introduces measures to assist disadvantaged apprentices, including those from low-income families, First Nations communities and regional areas. It must be said, there are too many kids from disadvantaged backgrounds who don't even consider that an apprenticeship is even on their horizon. They don't even consider that it's a possibility. Maybe it's intergenerational poverty, or whatever it is, but it's not even on their horizon. This allows them to consider those new horizons. It puts it within reach and opens up the opportunities. These measures aim to address the financial barriers that may hinder participation in apprenticeships, promoting equal opportunities and social mobility. It can be very important for teachers and other community leaders to get the word out that this is now possible. Talk to kids who may be struggling at school, perhaps, but who may be perfect for an apprenticeship or a trade. Let them know that this sort of support is available to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also acknowledges the importance of ongoing support and mentorship for apprentices throughout their journey. Recognising that apprenticeships can be challenging, the legislation proposes the establishment of a mentoring program. That program will connect experienced tradespeople and industry professionals with apprentices, providing guidance, advice and encouragement. By fostering these relationships we can enhance apprentices' skill development, retention rates and overall success in their chosen occupations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill emphasises the importance of quality training and assessment for apprentices. To ensure high standards across the apprenticeship system, the bill introduces stricter compliance measures for training providers and employers. This includes monitoring and evaluating the quality of training delivery, assessment practices and the overall learning experience. By maintaining rigorous standards, we can safeguard the integrity of apprenticeships and ensure that apprentices receive the necessary skills and knowledge for their future careers. The last thing we want is to see kids going into a training program or apprenticeship with some dodgy bloke down the back shed who doesn't give them the skills and training they really require, causing them to come out with an absolutely worthless qualification. We want to make sure that they get the skills and training that they're paying for, and, indeed, that the government is contributing to, so that they get the skills and training that the community needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To reflect the expanded eligibility, the bill will also rename the current trade support loans as Australian apprenticeship support loans. This rebranding signifies the inclusivity of the scheme beyond the trades, recognises the changing landscape of apprenticeships and aligns with the overarching incentive system introduced in July last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments proposed in this bill replace the outdated trade support loans priority list with the Australian apprenticeships priority list, and this priority list will be determined by the minister based on the advice of Jobs and Skills Australia and will be regularly updated to align with current and future skills needs. By maintaining an up-to-date priority list, we can ensure that access to the loan scheme reflects the most pressing skills gaps in our labour market, supporting apprentices in occupations that are in demand and will contribute significantly to our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that these amendments complement and align with the broader Australian apprenticeships incentive system, underscoring the Albanese government's commitment to comprehensive reform in the apprenticeships sector. These reforms aim to address the urgent skills crisis we are facing as a nation and secure a more prosperous future for our workers. Australia has the second-highest labour supply shortages across all OECD countries. Three million Australians currently lack the fundamental skills required to participate in training and secure work. I know this is the case in Tasmania, including in my own electorate. We don't have enough skilled workers, and it affects our economy, our productivity and the ability of people to find secure and meaningful employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers in remote, rural and regional areas have been crying out, wanting to upskill or reskill for years. Unfortunately, the former government largely ignored this and created a skills crisis. When you rip billions of dollars out of TAFE training programs and skills programs over nine years in government, the effect is that you end up with a skills drought at the end of it. When you're nine years in government and you've got fewer people completing traineeships and apprenticeships after nine years than when you started, that shows there's a problem. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've got a huge job ahead of us to reskill, and the minister is making a terrific start, with 480,000 Australians able to take part in fee-free TAFE. We've got to do better by our young people who need these jobs and programs. The Albanese government is not leaving anybody behind, especially not young workers who are looking to gain skilled and meaningful employment. Our billion-dollar fee-free TAFE skills arrangement announced in October does give Australians the opportunity to upskill through those places from January this year, and already, as we've heard, 150,000 Australians, many of them young Australians, have taken up this great opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must stress, though, while of course we do associate TAFE and training with young people, it's not just restricted to young people. We have older people wanting to retrain and get back into the workforce. Perhaps they have been made redundant and want to reskill in a new area. They also can take advantage of this. We've got older women gaining new skills. Indeed, I met a woman training to be an aged-care worker at Clarence TAFE just a few weeks ago, and she said that she wouldn't have undertaken that course if it hadn't been for the fee-free nature of it. She would be in her 50s, and there she is looking to join the critical aged-care workforce. I look forward to seeing her at one of the aged-care centres in my electorate soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House now is testament to providing further opportunity for young workers. We are making trade and skills training more accessible for more Australians. The Albanese government is committed to improving jobs and skills education across the country. Sorell, which is in my electorate, will receive a new jobs and skills hub as a result of an election promise, ensuring more skilled work education in the south-east region of Tasmania. Young people living in rural and regional areas across Tasmania and Australia deserve the same opportunities as those living in our cities. They deserve access to services that will benefit their future without having to travel so far for them. We are delivering these opportunities for our young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government stole opportunity from our young people over their nine years in office. It was the Liberals who defunded TAFE, giving school leavers limited ability to upskill and learn a trade. The Leader of the Opposition was part of a government that deliberately kept wages low—such a betrayal of young workers. We are different. We are bringing this program in and we look forward to seeing it work and seeing more young people take up the opportunity of an apprenticeship.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  I rise to speak on the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023. It's an important bill, because apprenticeships and traineeships provide hands-on training, equipping individuals with practical skills and knowledge that are essential for specific industries. By focusing on skills development, apprenticeships create a highly competent workforce that will meet the evolving needs of industry, fostering innovation and productivity. A skilled and adaptable workforce contributes to economic growth. By investing in apprenticeships and traineeships, Australia enhances its human capital, which in turn attracts investment, stimulates innovation and fosters business growth. This leads to increased productivity, improved competitiveness and a stronger economy overall. For these reasons, the coalition will be supporting this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially, this legislation amends the Trade Support Loans Act 2014 to expand the program, which is currently available only to apprentices in priority trade occupations. These reforms will mean the program will now be available to apprentices and trainees in a broad range of priority occupations, including non-trade occupations such as aged care, disability support and child care. The loans provided will empower these individuals to pursue their trade pathways without being hindered by financial constraints. Easing the burden of up-front costs will open doors to countless opportunities and foster a more inclusive and diverse workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In true Labor style of renaming successful programs, this program will also be renamed 'Australian apprenticeship support loans'. The program aims to increase completion rates among Australian apprentices in priority areas by providing them with financial support for their cost of living and learning while undertaking an apprenticeship. This is achieved by offering concessional income-contingent loans, up to a maximum of $22,890, which are paid back when the taxable income of the apprentice reaches the repayment threshold. For the 2022-23 income year the compulsory repayment threshold is $48,361. These are sensible reforms which the coalition developed while in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will amend the act to empower the minister to determine, having had regard to any relevant advice given to the minister by Jobs and Skills Australia, a new Australian apprenticeships priority list. And it amends the act to provide that a qualifying apprenticeship is, among other things, an apprenticeship through which a person is undertaking a qualification that leads to an occupational qualification specified on the Australian apprenticeships priority list. These changes will mean that the skills minister can expand the program's access to people who, through their apprenticeship or traineeship, are undertaking qualifications that lead to occupations experiencing skills shortages, such as occupations in the aged-care, disability care and childcare sectors. These are sensible changes to align apprenticeships with industries where more workers are needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many Australians, apprentices and trainees are doing it tough right now. The prices for their groceries, their fuel and their electricity are all going up but their wages aren't. Enabling more students to access this support will be critical to more apprentices completing their studies. Despite what those opposite like to claim, the Liberals and Nationals invested record amounts into the Australian skills system, which delivered the highest number of apprentices on record. During the pandemic, the coalition ensured apprentices were protected with a wage subsidy measure and supported jobseekers and young people to get skills in the jobs of the future with low or fee-free training through the $2.1 billion JobTrainer Fund. JobTrainer created around 478,000 training places in areas of skills need, including 48,000 places in aged-care training. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition committed over $13 billion to the skills sector, since the pandemic began, including a record $7.8 billion in their final financial year in office. We saved more than 530,000 apprentices and trainees through our wage subsidies, announced when the pandemic hit, with total pandemic apprentice wage subsidy support reaching over $7.9 billion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was fortunate recently to visit Yarra Ranges Tech, a great institution based in Lilydale, out in the Yarra Valley. They support trainees, working with schools and those who the traditional school system doesn't work for. They bring them into that system. They have a wonderful Taster program, where students spend the first year trying different trades and things, like cooking. I saw those young people and spoke to them. For them to be able to find a real passion and dignity of work through those trainee programs is really important. That's why we need to continue supporting apprentices. There's an impact on the individual, society and, ultimately, the economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous coalition government invested a further $2.4 billion from 1 July 2022 to upskill apprentices in a streamlined new Australian Apprenticeships Incentive System. The new approach focused on boosting completions, to get more apprentices through their studies and into the workforce. This put in place subsidies for employers of 10 per cent in the first two years of hiring a new apprentice and a further five per cent in the third year. Apprentices also received up to $5,000 in direct support payments to help them with the cost-of-living challenges. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We supported small businesses, to invest in the skills of their employees and train new ones, through the Skills and Training Boost. We established the National Skills Commission to provide expert advice and national leadership on the labour market, current and future skills needs and workforce development. We also secured agreement with the states and territories to overhaul Australia's VET system. The reforms were aimed at ensuring courses and qualifications were driven by and better met the needs of industry and students. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so important to always connect what businesses need with what apprentices need. That is what this bill does and is why it has bipartisan support. On this side of the House we value and acknowledge the crucial role that apprentices play in Australia's economy, contributing significantly to its growth, productivity and competitiveness. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Casey is unique. It starts from the end of the suburban Melbourne fringe and goes into the Yarra Valley with its many farmers. Master Builders Australia has Casey as the highest electorate, as a percentage of workforce, for trades. We have a lot of tradies but we also have a lot of nurses, aged-care workers and early childhood workers, so we know firsthand the opportunities that come. We also have a strong agricultural and horticultural industry. Being able to connect apprenticeships, particularly for horticulture, and showing young people the opportunities there is so important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These young people are really the backbone of the economy, out in Casey, and we're creating opportunities for them. I recently announced the 2023 Casey Apprentice and Trainee Awards. We're calling for nominations of diligent and hardworking people in Casey. Our local apprentices and trainees will be the backbone of our trades, small businesses, childcare and aged-care sectors into the future. It is so important that we recognise these young Australians working so hard to make a better life for themselves and their families. So if you know someone who you think is a great apprentice, please nominate them via my website. It could be any workmates, employees, friends or your own children or grandkids you think deserve recognition. It's so important that we recognise these young people who are doing great work in our community.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, agriculture is a big part of the Yarra Valley and a big employer of apprentices in our community, and it would be remiss of me, as we speak about agriculture, not to take a moment to pay tribute to Gordon Chapman—an amazing person from the Yarra Valley who, sadly, passed away last week. He was known to many. Gordon was an institution in the farming community in the Yarra Valley. He was a trailblazer of his time, having introduced the concept of a 'U-pick' farm to Australia after visiting the USA in the 1970s. Gordon ran Chappies U-pick, growing raspberries, blackberries and cherries among other fruit. He leaves a legacy in the Yarra Valley as a well-respected, hard-working, giving and valued member of our community, particularly in the communities of Wandin and Silvan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Gordon and his family made a significant contribution to our community, including through his involvement with the Mont De Lancey homestead. I was very fortunate to catch up with Gordon at the 30th anniversary for Mont De Lancey just three or four weeks ago, and he was in fine spirits, cracking jokes, having a laugh and owning the room as only Gordon Chapman could. It was wonderful that I got some time with him there and also on Anzac Day when, despite being aged in his 90s, he was able to attend the Wandin ceremony. It was wonderful to see him. He was also a stalwart of the Liberal Party, having been a member since 1969. He provided me with great support and friendship through all my time in the Liberal Party since I joined as a volunteer over a decade ago. There was always a kind word. He knew my family, who are also in farming, for decades, so it was wonderful to have his support as I joined the party and during my journey to becoming the member for Casey. I send my love and support to his family, who I know are doing it tough, but we take comfort that Gordon is now with his beloved wife, Linda. Rest in peace, Chappie. I'll miss your counsel, your frank advice and your sense of humour.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some stakeholders have raised concerns about the consultation process which the minister's office conducted in regard to the bill. However, they remain broadly supportive of the passage of the legislation. Stakeholders have noted that the minister's office did no external consultation whatsoever. Indeed, the government's explanatory memorandum seems to admit that they did no further consultation and have broadly accepted the coalition's reforms without amendment—except for the obligatory name change, as with all good legislation from this government that is based on the great work of the coalition. If you don't change the name, you can't take credit for the work of the previous government. So I am grateful for the government's acknowledgement that our skills policies were working, and, as I said, the government must think so considering they have taken our policy and decided it was so good that no further consultation was necessary. They were able to do that because of our extraordinary work in the skills and VET space. This is a strong record to stand on, as Labor seems to be doing, and we will support them, as we are with this legislation, when they bring good policy forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so important for the individual that we support apprentices, because a job for a young person provides so much more than a wage. They develop so many of the life skills that will set them up for success. It's really important that we acknowledge that, while there's a lot of conversation about higher education—and higher education is important; we need to continue to support it—it's not for everyone. Apprenticeships are a way for those who aren't suited to higher education to have an opportunity to learn, grow, develop and become great members of our society. Apprentices and trainees are vital to Australia's economy due to their role in developing skills, ensuring a supply of skilled workers, staying relevant to industry needs, providing career pathways, driving economic growth and delivering social benefits. Investing in these programs is investment not only in the individual but also in the nation's future prosperity as a society and in ensuring we have a strong economy moving forward. So I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  I rise to make my contribution on the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023 and the Student Loans (Overseas Debtors Repayment Levy) Amendment Bill 2023. Australians across the country do not need to be told that there is currently a skills shortage, because every day they see it and feel it. Whether it's a call to a plumber or blacksmith or as simple as going to the butcher, Australians see that there are simply not enough workers in everyday services that we used to be able to take for granted. The national Skills Priority List now stands at 286. That's 286 occupations that are not meeting the demand, in part due to lack of workers. Nurses, aged-care workers, mechanics, early childhood educators and carpenters are among the occupations on that list. Not for a second can we imagine a functioning society without them. Who do we expect to take care of us when we're older, educate our children or ensure that we have a roof over our heads?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government takes seriously the challenges of the skills shortage because, when skills are in short supply, it inhibits economic growth and impacts the services that Australians most rely on. You simply can't hire more carpenters if those carpenters don't exist. The skills shortage can't be solved by the market alone. Government must play a role in guiding and investing in Australians and their skills. The Albanese government said we would establish a permanent body called Jobs and Skills Australia. That's exactly what we've done, because we are a government that keeps our promises, ensuring that we have the independent advice we need to address the challenges that are before us. We said we would provide fee-free TAFE places, and already almost 150,000 students have enrolled in the 180,000 fee-free courses on offer this year. Only recently we announced an additional 300,000 places for the 2024 to 2026 years. Our government is also funding an additional 20,000 university places this year and next year. These are practical policies that don't just fix the microeconomic issues facing us but also help to upskill and train Australians for better, more secure and more well-paying jobs, because investing in Australian people is what Labor governments do and it's what's required of us for our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are a continuation of our investment in Australians. Trade support loans are there to help Australian apprentices meet their everyday expenses. They help support them with interest-free loans as recognition of the low wages in the first few years of an apprenticeship. As of 28 March 2023, over 167,000 apprentices have taken up trade support loans since the scheme's establishment. However, the trade support loans scheme has a significant flaw. It does not acknowledge those who are in an occupation listed as a priority occupation but are non-trade workers—that is, it excludes many essential workers in the care economy: aged care, disability care and early childhood education. These are undervalued and heavily female dominated sectors. This legislation seeks to fix that. It replaces the trade support loans priority list with a new Australian apprenticeships priority list that will no longer be limited to trade occupations and will provide ongoing flexibility to the program. It opens doors for thousands of those in the care sector to access monthly loans to help with the cost of living. Year on year, completion rates have been in decline because apprentices and others have not been able to finish their courses. Reversing this trend is essential for the development of meaningful career pathways for Australians and also for the health of our economy. Those who participate in this scheme will be eligible for a 20 per cent discount on their loan on completion of the apprenticeship, an incentive to encourage apprentices to finish their training and go on to be useful parts of our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government will continue to strengthen the financial and non-financial supports available through the entirety of the apprenticeship and will work with industry and unions through the JSA to ensure that services are meeting their needs. Our success is built by workers and their skills, and, as any good government does, the Albanese government is investing in Australians. That's because, in uncertain global economic times, this investment safeguards Australia and strengthens the resilience of our country. I thank the honourable minister for the work he's done in supporting workers in their pursuit of greater skills and training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a representative from a diverse and working-class community, I know the important role that tertiary and vocational education systems play in obtaining well-paid and secure work. Werriwa has two TAFEs—one in Miller and one at Macquarie Fields. Both provide quality training in a vast number of areas. Both these facilities provide quality education, and I'm certain that many students at those TAFEs will benefit from this bill and what it seeks to do. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  I rise to speak on the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023 and the related bill. Following the federal budget release, I have been highly vocal about the need to ease pressures on students with HECS-HELP student loans, especially with the 7.1 per cent indexation increase. This is such an important issue that affects the young people in my electorate of Fowler and probably also across other low socioeconomic, disadvantaged electorates. These students are struggling to meet their day-to-day expenses and are now facing further financial hardships. As you would have seen in various media reports, student debt indexation is projected to have a lifelong impact on students' borrowing capacity, as student debt will be factored in when applying for any loans with financial institutions. This would mean that your children, nephews, nieces, siblings or cousins may be crippled by further debt following the 7.1 per cent indexation. This percentage of government-initiated indexation is much higher than the wage growth of three to four per cent that many Australians have received right now. Therefore, I move the amendment circulated in my name:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Naturally, I'm concerned with some of the unintended consequences of this loan. Vocational education and training are instrumental to Australia's growing economy, and supporting the development of these skills through our legislative bills is critical. Nearly 13,000 people in my Fowler electorate are currently in some form of tertiary education. Almost 12 per cent of employed people aged 15 years and over are currently in technician and trade work. The introduction of the trade support program in 2014 has allowed for Australian apprentices, including those in Fowler, to obtain a loan of up to $22,890 in total for the 2022-23 year, paid monthly in arrears to meet everyday living costs. Branded as interest-free loans, apprentices are not required to repay the loan until they are earning an income above the minimum repayment threshold of $48,361, as of this year. Apprentices who complete their apprenticeships will receive a 20 per cent reduction on the trade support loans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At face value, this appears enticing to apprentices in trades to assist with the growth of in-demand occupations. In practice, however, there are some shortcomings with this piece of legislation that I'm not convinced are being holistically addressed in this bill. I have concerns that these trade support loans, which are now being revamped as the Australian apprenticeships support loans, could trap more hopeful students in further debt. After unpacking this bill, I understand that it will have the following key effects if implemented: It will lapse the TSL priority list and replace it with the Australian apprenticeships priority list to expand eligibility to other high-priority occupations that are non-trade, such as aged care, disability, child care, nursing, personal assistants, therapy et cetera. The minister will be empowered to have regard to any relevant advice by the minister responsible for Jobs and Skills Australia for the AAPL. I acknowledge that these developments will bring forward some positive changes, such as better access for women who want to pursue non-trade occupations, and I applaud the government for including women in this bill. Given the fluidity of this list, though this change, I hope this will keep Australia in check as our country and economy evolves and our priorities change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the minister is not prevented from having regard to other advice. So I urge the minister to actively obtain advice from fellow MPs across the entire political spectrum, especially those with low-socioeconomic electorates, to ensure that the occupations are aligned with not only the needs of Australia's economy but also will pave a pathway for disadvantaged communities to gain meaningful and fruitful employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this bill is a double-edged sword. Whilst I welcome the expansion of the loans to other critical occupations, specifically in the childcare and aged-care sectors, I ask the government to consider whether there are sufficient incentives to encourage individuals to engage in the Australian apprentice support loans and make this bill a success. According to a recent report by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span>, about one billion dollars are outstanding in trade support loans, and one in every two trade apprentices drop out before completing the course. This is not a small figure. Despite the incentives of the discount of 20 per cent on completion, not all individuals are inclined to finish their apprenticeships, as other jobs may actually pay more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same article reports that first year apprentices and trainees can earn as little as $13 an hour, totalling $520 a week. The current cost-of-living pressures prevalent in Australia, particularly experienced within the Fowler electorate, may further deter individuals from wanting to enter the professions in demand because of the earnings. People have families to provide for, and it may not be realistic to survive and live off the poverty earnings of just $520 a week, especially in major population centres and including the increasingly high rents that we're experiencing at the moment. Just consider food expenses. A bag of sliced wholemeal bread was $1.80 in 2018 and now is a minimum of $2.70 depending on the brand of bread. Let's consider the commuting cost for apprentices to travel to and from work. If an apprentice were to travel from Cabramatta Station to Central Station, it's about $3.79 one way and a total of $7.58 return. The apprentice commutes five days a week, which would equate to about $37.90. While the difference may not appear blatantly drastic, every cent adds up for families who are disadvantaged—not to mention the amount of tolls and the cost of fuel for those who drive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst these loans are branded as interest free, they do not actually come for free. The Australian apprentice support loans under this program are still indexed according to the Consumer Price Index to meet the real market value of the loan. This is essentially the same issue as other accumulated study and training loans. If you consider this against the cost-of-living crisis, this is an obvious issue for those who are disadvantaged. One young local professional told me that her HECS debt has increased by $4,400 just this year, yet she only entered the workforce four years ago. After sharing her experience to other young hopefuls in her community, most are deterred from studying her profession given the accumulated debt and indexation. This is no different to other hopeful Australian apprentices looking to enter their chosen professions, only to be disillusioned by the anticipated debt and indexation. To think how much this will build up year on year is unfathomable. Will our young people and future generations be able to break the debt cycle?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the government, especially its members from Western Sydney and those representing low-socioeconomic electorates: how can you realistically slug students and apprentices with an index increase of seven per cent plus, which is much higher than the current average wage increases? At a time with soaring interest rates and stubbornly high house prices, how can aspiring first home buyers take out home loans when their borrowing capacity is impacted by the dark mark of a bigger study and training debt? Our youth are the future of Australia. The people that will be assisting with rebuilding the economy are our future. By not addressing the indexation within this bill, we are continuing to handicap the brightness of their potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a Labor government that in its history proudly announces the Whitlam government's introduction of free education, this current indexation is certainly a vast step backwards. History will judge this. It is certainly not in the tradition of compassion and support that is needed in this current cost-of-living crisis. If we cannot revert to 1974 and provide free education then we should, at the bare minimum, do something about indexation for students and apprentices. Who would not be deterred when they hear that they should expect 7.1 per cent indexation just off this year for entering a profession that they are passionate about and which could be one that Australia needs to drive the economy? It is simply not enough that we are opening the categories of occupations eligible for these loans and offering a 20 per cent discount on completion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While speaking with a few aspiring early childhood educators within Fowler, it was noted that they would prefer, at the minimum, the indexation to revert to the 2022 rate of 3.9 per cent for loans under the Australian apprenticeship support loans scheme, and an increase of the discount to reflect at least a quarter of their loan amount. In my view, this is a more attractive incentive which should be drafted into this bill. It's more in line with the current economy and living standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill is intended to create better access and opportunities, especially for women entering the care sector for employment, the bill must be curated with this intention at the forefront. The government can do much more to support individuals who are seeking to rely on this loan and enter the demand-labour workforce. Therefore, I call on the government to consider reverting indexation for Australian apprenticeship support loans and indexation back to the 2022 rate of 3.9 per cent and to freeze it at this rate, perhaps for at least three years, upon earning the minimum repayment income. This would allow disadvantaged individuals to work full-time, pay down their loans and meet the cost-of-living crisis in their living needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Mehreen Faruqi, who has put the interests of apprentices and students at the forefront since the announcement of the indexation. While it's a long conversation on reducing indexation, and perhaps abolishing it altogether, I look forward to seeing the future changes that may be proposed in this area of concern. We need to give young people a kickstart in their careers, beyond just a loan. There should be a safety net where they know they can engage in a demanding profession without being hit by a mountain of incrementally growing debt.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="300130" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  I want to give my support to the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023, a life-changing piece of legislation that amends the Trade Support Loans Act 2014. It has the aim of enhancing access to income-dependent loans for apprentices and trainees across our country. This bill holds the power to shape the future of our nation, workforce and economy. These amendments are not merely minor adjustments, they are a big step towards a fairer and more inclusive future for our apprentices and trainees. By expanding eligibility for these loans, we can provide much-needed support to those who strive to make meaningful contributions to our workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we are all aware, our country is currently facing significant challenges, with shortages of skills and labour across industries that are vital to the health and wellbeing of our fellow Australians, and the prosperity of our economy. These shortages have not gone unnoticed, and it is our duty to find effective solutions that address this pressing issue. This bill seeks to do just that by introducing measures to facilitate the expansion of the longstanding trade support loan program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can provide much-needed support to apprentices, and, what's more, these amendments will ensure that loans become available to apprentices and trainees in priority non-trade sectors for the first time, including those in female dominated apprenticeships. By making these loans accessible to female apprentices, we can break down barriers and empower women to pursue careers in fields traditionally dominated by men. This not only enhances gender diversity but also brings fresh perspectives and skills to industries that desperately need them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill, the Trade Support Loans Act will be amended to ensure that apprentices and trainees in priority occupations, including non-trade occupations, can benefit from these income-contingent loans. This expansion of eligibility marks a significant milestone as we embrace apprenticeships in sectors such as aged care, child care and disability care, acknowledging their important role in our society. To reflect this expanded eligibility and improved flexibility, we have rebranded the loan scheme from trade support loans to Australian apprenticeship support loans. This change highlights our commitment to being inclusive and recognising that apprenticeships extend far beyond the traditional trades. By expanding the eligibility of all these loans, we can provide much-needed support to those who strive to make a meaningful contribution to our workforce. It demonstrates the Albanese Labor government's understanding that all apprentices, regardless of their chosen occupation, deserve equal opportunity for success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to expanding eligibility, these amendments also seek to improve the administration of the scheme. We understand that apprentices face various challenges, including meeting the daily cost of living. These amendments address this concern by providing apprentices with the necessary support to meet their financial needs while pursuing their training. The available loan amounts are tapered over the life of the apprenticeship in recognition of the lower wages in the first few years of training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the bill includes provisions to backdate trade support loan payments. This measure is designed to provide immediate support to apprentices and prevent the potential for them to miss payments due to administrative errors. We recognise the importance of timely and accurate support and we are committed to ensuring that our apprentices receive the assistance they deserve when they need it most. By enhancing access to income-contingent loans, improving administration and expanding eligibility, we are creating a more supportive and nurturing environment for our apprentices and trainees which will contribute to the chances of them succeeding and completing their training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must acknowledge the importance of investing in our future workforce. By providing adequate support and resources to apprentices, we are laying the foundation for a prosperous and thriving nation. We are not only empowering individuals to achieve their full potential but also to strengthen our economy as skilled professionals contributing to productivity and economy growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stand before you to discuss the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill, I feel compelled to share a personal story that demonstrates the transformative power of training and education. Like many of you, I have experienced firsthand the life-changing impact that comes from acquiring new skills and knowledge. My journey began years ago when I embarked on a quest to learn English at my local TAFE. As a new migrant with a family to support, I knew that, for me to get a job here in Australia, I needed to learn the English language. It was a humble beginning, but it laid a foundation for a path that would shape my future. With newfound language skills, I pursued training in typing and basic computer skills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These seemingly small steps propelled me forward, equipping me with the tools necessary to embark on a career that I have long dreamed of—a career in law enforcement. Through dedicated training and unwavering determination, I became a police officer, serving the community for more than 15 years. From the streets to the police station, I witnessed firsthand the critical role that skill development plays in fostering safety, security and justice in our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My journey within the police force was not without challenges, but it was through ongoing training and professional development that I was able to advance my career from a probationary constable to a sergeant. I had the opportunity to lead and inspire others, working collaboratively to make our neighbourhoods safer and more resilient. Now, as a member of this esteemed parliament, I stand before you a testament to the life-changing power of training and education. My journey, which began with English language courses at TAFE, led me to this moment, a moment when I have the privilege to support an initiative such as Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I share this personal experience not to boast but to emphasise that training and education have the power to shape lives, create opportunities and drive progress in our communities. The Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill aims to do just that, to provide Australian apprentices and trainees with the resources to support their needs to succeed in their chosen careers. It is a bill that understands the transforming nature of training, as it expands access to income-contingent loans and ensures fairness across a broader range of occupations. The Albanese Labor government is sending a clear message that apprentices' and trainees' contributions to our society are valued and that we are invested in their success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I urge each and every one of you to support the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023. Let us come together to empower our apprentices and trainees, irrespective of their chosen occupation, and provide them with the necessary tools and opportunity to thrive. By doing so, we not only shape the lives of individuals but also ensure the prosperity and wellbeing of our country.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  Today I am pleased to second the amendment moved by the member for Fowler and to speak to the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill. Trade support loans were introduced in July 2014 to encourage more young people to take up and complete a trade qualification. I'm pleased to say that members of my own family have done so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The trade support loan provides loans to people completing their apprenticeships. The program aims to support apprentices to meet the everyday costs they encounter while undertaking their training. It currently provides up to $22,890 to an apprentice in loans contingent upon the apprentice's income. Essentially, the amount of the loan is higher in the early years of the apprenticeship and reduces overtime as apprentice wages increase. Once an apprentice completes their apprenticeship, they receive a 20 per cent discount on their loan repayment amount. Loans are repaid through the Australian Taxation Office once an apprentice earns above a minimum repayment threshold, which is $48,361 for the 2022-23 income year. This is the same amount that applies to all study and training loans. To minimise the risk of a person accruing large debts unintentionally, apprentices are required to reapply or opt in every six months to receive a further six instalments of loans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, more than 50,000 apprentices across a variety of industries received a trade support loan payment. In addition, nearly 17,000 applications were received, and a completion discount was paid to more than 12,000 apprentices. But, currently, only apprentices in trade related apprenticeships are eligible to receive these trade support loans. Therefore, I welcome the change in this bill to expand the Australian apprenticeships priority list to include a wider range of critical non-trade apprentices and trainees in priority occupation areas. These areas include childhood educators, and aged-care and disability workers. As we know, these sectors are experiencing incredibly extreme staff shortfalls nationally. In relation to the early childhood sector, I've been hearing from staff, parents and owners, especially those who are trying to open, and keep open, early learning centres and kindergartens. The calls I'm receiving tell of calls to parents because rooms can't be staffed, while parents are trying to get themselves to work and their older children to school. They tell how the illness of just a few staff can reduce staff ratios to unmanageable and unsafe levels, and how parents are distressed over yet another call to their employer to say that they're unable to come to work because of childcare shortages. So I'm really pleased to see that there is multiparty support for the trade support loans amendments today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Expanding this program to include traineeships in the care sector is expected to primarily benefit female apprentices and trainees. Given the workforce shortages with which we're all familiar, this is a really welcome development. Australia is experiencing serious skill shortages, and measures must be implemented to support these in-demand occupations, so I suggest that the amendment proposed by the member for Fowler is a very sensible one. The unprecedented high indexation on loans applicable under the Australian apprenticeships priority list almost certainly is a deterrent for disadvantaged individuals pursuing these really high-demand occupations. I reiterate the member for Fowler's call on the government to place a temporary freeze on trade support loan indexation at the 2022 rate of 3.9 per cent to allow Australian apprentices to work full time, pay down their loans and meet their cost-of-living needs.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023 and the associated legislation, particularly because these bills provide additional financial support and other support to apprentices and trainees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are facing a significant skills shortage in our country and in my electorate of Hughes, and any financial or other support that can be provided to encourage people into apprenticeships and traineeships and to retain them must be supported. As I move through my electorate, there is a consistent cry from businesses and employers about jobs and skills shortages, from hairdressers to baristas, chefs, motor mechanics, fitters and turners, early childhood educators and aged-care workers. These bills will assist in addressing these shortages, increase workforce participation, increase productivity in the economy and foster greater diversity within our workforce. For all those reasons, I commend these bills to the House. It is noted that these bills reflect policy changes that were underway when the coalition was in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key point to this legislation, the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023, is that it amends the Trade Support Loans Act 2014 to facilitate the expansion of the trade support loans program, which is currently available only to apprentices in priority trade occupations. It will be expanded to apprentices and trainees in a broader range of priority occupations, including non-trade occupations such as aged care, disability support and child care. The trade support loans program aims to increase completion rates among Australian apprentices in priority areas by providing financial support to eligible apprentices to assist them with the costs of living and learning while undertaking an apprenticeship. The way that this is stated to be achieved is by offering income-contingent loans up to a maximum of $22,890, which are then paid back when the taxable income of the apprentice or trainee reaches the repayment threshold, which is currently just over $48,000 per year. In this way, the bill will facilitate wider access to loans, which will be renamed Australian apprenticeship support loans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to take a moment to talk about the state of apprentices and traineeships within Australia. Apprentices face significant barriers to the uptake and completion of an apprenticeship, and this is demonstrated by the long-term decline in the number of commencements and completions by apprentices. In particular, since 2012 and prior to the introduction of the COVID-19 response measures, apprenticeship commencements were declining, dropping 65 per cent from June 2012 to the comparable period in June 2020. This is of concern, and it has now translated, of course, into the significant skills shortage that we have within this country. The annual number of completions of apprenticeships and traineeships also declined, decreasing by about 55 per cent over the period from 2012 to 2020. Again, we are facing difficulties getting students into apprenticeships and then also retaining them and encouraging them to complete those traineeships. Some recent research that's been undertaken said that the movement of young people away from apprenticeships into higher education and other work with higher rates of pay has probably been the leading contributor to a drop in commencements and, significantly, a drop in completions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are significant barriers faced by both employers and apprentices at the moment. I'll start by talking about some of the barriers that are faced by employers. Again, these are barriers that we really need to address, and I hear this from employers in my electorate of Hughes. There are several factors that at the moment hinder the hiring of apprentices, including the high upfront costs, the risk of noncompletion, difficulty in recruitment and needing to navigate what has been and still is a fairly complex system. I would call on the government to look at these reasons that have been cited by employers and to look at trying to make it significantly easier for employers, particularly small businesses, to employ apprentices and trainees.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Employers have cited high hiring costs, particularly upfront costs, as a key barrier, and wage costs and other expenses associated with running a business have obviously grown substantially over the past two decades, and particularly over the last 12 months. However, the total standard apprenticeship incentive available to employers has remained unchanged at around $4,000 since 1998, so that is something that I feel that the government does really need to look at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also the time that's required by an employer to supervise and train an apprentice. This could be also seen as a barrier to employers. In the early years of an apprenticeship, supervision costs are high. It's demanding on their time. Often, the time spent supervising, for example, an apprentice or a trainee is time that is then taken away from that particular business. These are some of the barriers that have been cited by employers. It would be good if we could look at improving this situation for employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apprentices also face significant barriers. Low wages and the corresponding concern of not being able to meet the ongoing costs of living are barriers that have been cited by young people and by people that were considering taking up apprenticeships. It's a particular constraint that, for longer term qualifications, it can be for up to four years. Where an apprenticeship may take up to four years, it is considered by many to be a significant barrier, where apprentices are struggling to balance work, study, a social life and other household commitments. That's a significant barrier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of low wages on apprenticeship commencements and completions is compounded when the market presents higher-paying alternatives. For example, an apprentice mechanic earns a lower wage than a casual hospitality worker or labourer. This is another reason that has been cited as to why many people are not taking up the opportunities of apprenticeships. Financial barriers lower commencement and completion rates by making apprenticeships an unappealing financial decision for many. This may both deter individuals from considering an apprenticeship and lower the completion rates for those who do begin. These financial barriers are strongest in the early years of an apprenticeship, where wages are at their lowest and apprentices can choose better paying alternatives such as retail or hospitality work. In all of those circumstances, this bill, which will provide additional financial support to those undergoing an apprenticeship or a traineeship, is to be commended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll briefly mention women in apprenticeships. The number of women commencing apprenticeships has been steadily increasing over time, which is good news. However, women face a number of barriers to undertaking and successfully completing an apprenticeship, particularly in trade occupations, where there has traditionally been low take-up by women compared to men. Women in non-traditional trades account for only seven per cent of total trade apprenticeships. Women have traditionally gone into hairdressing and the caring industries: child care, disability services and aged care. So we really do need to look at whatever measures can be introduced to assist women into apprenticeships, and particularly into non-trade apprenticeships. The minister's explanatory memorandum on this bill said that it is expected that this legislation will boost support for women's continued participation in the workforce and provide equal support for apprenticeships traditionally undertaken by women in the traditional caring sectors of aged care, disability care and child care. All of those are areas where the country is experiencing significant shortages. That is another reason that I am supporting this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are more than 10,000 tradespeople in my electorate of Hughes. These account for about 13 per cent of people employed within my electorate. We currently have 3,356 apprentices and trainees in training, as at the September quarter last year. That's composed of 2,190 in trade occupations and 1,166 engaged in non-trade occupations. I have a TAFE at Loftus, and there are TAFEs at Gymea and Liverpool, which are just outside of my electorate. All three of these serve Hughes's students. In terms of community colleges, we have the St George &amp; Sutherland Community College in Jannali and the Australian Community Education College in Bangor, both of which provide quality education to a broad range of students, making them both skilled and job ready.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To my electorate of Hughes: I recently opened the Hughes Awards, and they include a specific category for the apprentice of the year. Anybody within or without my electorate can nominate somebody who either lives in or works in my electorate. It could be your child, your grandchild, your partner, your friend or your employee. Just go to my website, jenny.ware.com.au, and look for the award nomination form, or you can contact my office. I'm looking forward to reading all of the nominations for apprentice of the year.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, these bill support apprentices and trainees. They will increase productivity and diversity within the workplace, and for all of those reasons I commend the bills to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I8M" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHARLTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  I rise to support the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023 and the Student Loans (Overseas Debtors Repayment Levy) Amendment Bill 2023. The amendments included in these bills build upon the federal government's existing trade support loans, established in 2014. Every year, these interest-free, income-contingent loans are crucial to thousands of Australian apprentices and businesses alike. They provide up to $22,890 for apprentices to meet their day-to-day costs while they undertake training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade support loans have been a success; in fact, trade support loans have a high take-up rate and support a significant number of apprentices across Australia. Between 2021 and 2022, 16,655 TSL applications were approved and 50,428 apprentices received a TSL payment. A 20 per cent completion discount for those who successfully completed their apprenticeships was also given to more than 12,000 apprentices. I also note that, since the program started in 2014, 159,139 applications from eligible apprentices have been approved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade support loans have historically aimed to reduce inequality in educational and employment opportunities. They help level the playing field by providing those who opt for vocational education with opportunities for financial support similar to those often afforded only to university students. By offering income-contingent loans, trade support loans also help ensure that repayments are affordable, making it easier for recipients to manage their finances. Importantly, this means that more Australians, regardless of their financial circumstances, are enabled to embark on a career in trade. This is a powerful step towards promoting social mobility and reducing economic disparity when it comes to accessing vocational training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a commendable initiative that will help Australians when they need it most, especially as the cost-of-living crisis continues to hit households across the country. These measures tackle the issue of high and rising financial barriers faced by our aspiring tradespeople trying to pursue vocational education and training, and these bills build on existing opportunities by expanding access to trade support loans to a broader range of priority fields and professions, including some non-trade occupations, like aged care, disability support and child care. These are industries that are crucial to the positive future we promised during the last election, which we're delivering through policies that improve aged care by ensuring a registered nurse is onsite 24 hours a day, seven days a week; through our commitment to protecting the National Disability Insurance Scheme; and through our measures to make child care cheaper and more affordable—something that benefits 96 per cent of families in my electorate of Parramatta.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent report from Melbourne university's Centre for the Study of Higher Education found that the last 34 years have seen large amounts of HELP debt accumulated. The report also found that, while debt was accrued, income levels in these occupations resulted in debt not being repaid or being repaid slowly. But, importantly, the report noted that these levels of debt did not exist for the many occupations which required VET sector training, whilst resulting in comparable levels of income. So it's clear that a benefit of the trade support loans program includes the ability to minimise the risk apprentices undertake in accruing large debts during their training, thanks to the lifetime limit and opt-in features of the program. It's also worth noting that the measures included in these bills improve the fairness of the program. The Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill also allows discretion to approve late applications in appropriate situations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of these bills lie the building blocks of a better future for aspiring tradespeople and critical industries alike. Not only do these bills help create employment opportunities and enable aspirational Australians to pursue their passions but they support critical industries that lack the workforce to grow and prosper. Importantly, these bills recognise the significance of vocational training and education in enabling economic empowerment for many Australians today while shaping our nation's workforce for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills build on the existing trade support loans by expanding the program to key priority occupations beyond those limited to the trades. This will mean more apprentices in more in-demand and priority industries will be able to access this crucial source of financial support. In recognition of this, one of the key provisions is to rename the trade support loans as the Australian apprenticeship support loans. Eligible apprentices currently undertake training in one of several priority areas. As of March 2023, this includes important industrial trades ranging from baking and bricklaying to telecommunications engineering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key provision of these bills is to enable the government to adapt to the needs of the labour market, ensuring that the contemporary workforce needs and priorities are met whilst providing more flexibility to prepare for emerging and future needs. The bills do this by allowing the minister, through legislative instrument, to determine the Australian Apprenticeships Priority List and, as a result, to determine which occupations or qualifications are a priority for the nation. Importantly, these bills also require the minister to consider the advice given by Jobs and Skills Australia when it comes to the current and emerging labour market, workforce needs and priorities, and Australia's current, emerging and future skills and training priorities. This helps ensure that eligibility is determined based on evidence and reflects up-to-date skills needs. The priority list will be updated manually to align with the latest forecasts and evidence from Jobs and Skills Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a stark contrast with the current state of the eligibility list, which has fallen into a state of static and neglect. The past couple of years alone have shown how much things have changed in Australia's economy and workforce, and it's a clear reminder of how the former coalition government operated when they let the priority list fall out of date for many years. Well, that ends now, and this forward-thinking approach when it comes to workforce development is exactly what Australia needs to build a more positive, prosperous and stable economic future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A highly skilled and competent workforce enhances productivity. It drives innovation and fosters economic growth. Skilled tradespeople are the backbone of our economy, whether it be in our infrastructure projects, building our bridges and roads, or in making our day-to-day appliances work. Investing in vocational training for aspiring tradespeople and workers doubles as an investment in the future prosperity of our country, and these bills do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to talk about the importance of education and the role it plays in enabling success in life. I stand here in this chamber as a proud member of the Australian Labor Party, who built our country's public education system. Good education is one of the building blocks of helping Australians reach their aspirations, and every child deserves that opportunity. These are the values instilled in me by my life experiences. My mum, Catherine, was a teacher for most of her life and shared with me her passion for learning, and I attribute much of what I've done later in life to this passion for education and learning. My commitment to my community is to share this passion and to help locals reach their aspirations through good local education, and that's why I am proud to be part of a government that is investing in education. As part of the May 2023 budget, we're creating an additional 300,000 TAFE places on top of the 180,000 we created last year. We've also delivered an additional $53.4 million to support Australian apprentices, benefiting no fewer than 3,940 apprentices currently training in Parramatta. I'm serious about education, and these bills are yet another example showing that the Albanese government is too. I commend them to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I rise today to address this House on a deceptively simple yet incredibly important bill, the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023. It's accompanied by the Student Loans (Overseas Debtors Repayment Levy) Amendment Bill 2023. So what are the trade support loans bills? Trade support loans are interest-free income based government loans that act as an incentive for people to complete their training in priority trade occupations. The loans are interest free while you are studying but then are indexed by CPI. Provided studies are successfully completed, the amount to be repaid is discounted by 20 per cent. I will return to the question of the CPI indexing later in my speech, as we know that is problematic across a number of areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What trades are supported in this proposal? Currently, the occupations included are limited to the traditional trades. This limitation does not serve the new economy, I would say, and does not achieve equity and certainty, and certainly does not benefit a whole range of occupations where Australia has a desperate and current identified need. So to remove current limitations, the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill allows the minister, by legislative instrument, to extend the types of occupations that will be covered and that will enable trainees to qualify for this type of discounted loan whilst completing their training and studies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the changes being made by this legislation? This expanded list of occupations, to be called the Australian Apprenticeships Priority List, has the potential to dramatically expand eligibility for loans to apprentices and trainees working in a very broad range of occupations that we know are subject to skills shortages. Australia's skills shortage is the second highest in OECD countries. We have been advised that the list will include occupations such as early childhood education, aged care and disability care but also will include occupations such as enrolled nursing, personal care assistants, therapists, dental technicians and many more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inclusion of these occupations where current shortages exist is to be applauded. We have to recognise that, traditionally, apprenticeships and traineeships have been overwhelmingly in male dominated occupations. Only a very small number have been available in occupations that are more female focused. So expanding this list to create some gender equity for young people in accessing the scheme is incredibly important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do the changes proposed in this bill match the need? The Australian Apprenticeships Priority List is a real crux of the change in this legislation. Getting this list right places a substantial and ongoing responsibility on the minister to ensure that the list is sufficiently expensive and reflective of current needs as well as anticipating future needs, and, realistically, it needs to remain dynamic to enable us to meet future challenges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What can we do to ensure the list becomes anticipatory rather than purely reactive? Getting it right requires understanding of and responding to the breadth of current needs and opportunities. Getting it right also requires anticipating what the new economy needs are going to be now and well into the future. The February 2023 <span style="font-style:italic;">L</span><span style="font-style:italic;">abour market update</span> lists the top 20 occupations in high demand nationally. These include a range of ICT disciplines from chefs to construction managers, retail managers, advertising and marketing professionals, physiotherapists and gardeners, so the needs are very broad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">L</span><span style="font-style:italic;">abo</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ur market update</span> also noted that it's important to recognise that there are many more occupations of key significance to the economy and the wellbeing of Australians. The need for additional workers in the new economy will include, for example, electricians with specialties such as heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, and, depending on what the government wants to do with our metals processing sector, metallurgists and other trades involved in the processing of critical minerals. The need for STEM qualifications tops every list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the benefits? The people and businesses in Warringah, for example, have been crying out for such changes. Many of my Warringah constituents have raised the challenges faced in employment, and in operating and building businesses because of skills shortages and the difficulty in accessing talent and workforce. This bill will benefit many businesses around Australia, and also in Warringah—as well as Warringah residents and all Australians. There will be an increased number of Australians who will be able to afford occupational training. Those already in training and facing hardship will be able to get discounted loans to ease that hardship. Those in training are more likely to complete their training because of the 20 per cent deduction for completing their apprenticeship or traineeship. That is the incentive—the carrot to get through. Currently, the statistics for completion are simply not good enough, and we are wasting resources in training up but not getting that completion factor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be increased choice in careers due to the broadening of occupations supported and by increasing the accessibility to those occupations. And there will be increased availability of trainees and qualified people for business and industry to employ. The bill will support the new economy by encouraging sustainable and inclusive economic growth; by contributing to the reduction of inequities, in particular gender inequity; and by boosting workforce participation by addressing the barriers for women, people with disabilities and low-income earners. It will reduce significant disadvantage by abolishing the current emphasis on favoured male-dominated industries; by pursuing broad based economic growth and job creation; and by embedding positive government interventions to support inclusion and sustainable growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the opportunity for more is there, so what else should the government be addressing? This bill is a critical step, and I encourage the government to expand and extend its support to the new economy by providing benefits that are far-reaching and which will enable Australians to prosper into the future. We should aim to address our fall to 25th in the Global Innovation Index—in 2018 we were at 17th and we're now at 25th—through an expanded emphasis on skilling the broadest range possible. Innovation will play a huge role in the future of the Australian economy. Equipping and upskilling new and existing workers for future jobs with STEM skills will be a key enabler for Australia to embrace new economy opportunities. And important contributions to the workplace and the economy flow from those who are re-entering the workforce after an extended absence, but it's easy for them to be overlooked. They'll need not only the financial support possible under this trade support loans bill but they're also crying out for a simplified training pathway to facilitate their return to work. That includes more tailored training offerings which more accurately take into account their earlier training and their incredible wealth of on-the-job experience. This is where gender equity plays a huge role, as we know that there's a huge number of women who, through caring responsibilities, have left the workforce and who want to return to the workforce and paid employment, but who are limited by that access to retraining and the difficulty of those training pathways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And we have to talk about indexation; it's a really critical issue. CPI is applied to all student loans, including loans under this Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill. There has been a concerning increase in student debt over the past two years because of above-target inflation and, hence, above-average indexation. We've gone from 3.9 per cent last year to 7.1 per cent this year. The rise is creating great consternation among the younger generations, who are facing higher costs of study and higher levels of debt, and now the debt is growing at rates faster than they can possibly pay down. This year the increase will rise faster than the average home loan, and nearly double the rate of wages growth. While I hope that this year is an anomaly, I think it has shown that the system is actually not quite right and that it's time for the government to look at that. We can't afford to put additional burdens on younger generations who are already struggling with the cost of living and the housing crisis. Graduates in the 20 to 29 age group will take the brunt of this CPI increase, with their increase rising by an average of some $2,069 on the median debt of a bit over $29,000 from study. With an increasing number of jobs requiring further education and training into the future, we must seek ways to reduce the fear of a debt burden on our younger generations and on older Australians seeking to retrain and re-enter the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alternative solutions need to be considered to relieve this burden. One potential mitigation would be to consider changing the indexation rate to be the lower rate of either the consumer price index or the Reserve Bank of Australia's official cash rate over the course of the year. To give the House an example of what that would do this year: it would mean indexation would be approximately 2.66 per cent rather than the planned 7.1 per cent. Alternatively, the government could also consider linking the wage price index—indexation would be linked to the wage price index—which is as it's done in the UK, for example. That would create a link between ability to repay and increase of debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the government considers further incentives around education, it must consider the disincentives to study that exist in the system and address the fear of the debt burden incurred by those training, whether it be through tertiary education or apprenticeships and traineeships. Fear of that debt burden is real. It is a very prominent part of decision-making and we must, in this place—and I urge the government to—do more to address that fear and concern, and deal with the debts incurred and how they will exacerbate future cost-of-living pressures for young Australians. I believe the current statistics are that we have about four people working in Australia, in the system, for every one person that doesn't work. In 20 years I believe it's anticipated that we will change that ratio to about two people working for every one person working. That says our system needs to adapt and change, and that we must incentivise training and participation in the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the government on the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023. I will support this legislation, but I encourage the government to be dogged in pursuing innovation and innovative solutions to address training and workforce issues, as I have highlighted, and to maximise workforce potential and contribution in our emerging new economy. Do not just look to immigration as a way of solving jobs and skills shortages, because that creates a whole range of other problems when it comes to infrastructure, housing and other access. We should first make sure we are maximising utilisation and participation of Australians here now. That means addressing gender inequity issues and opportunities for training and access to paid employment. I urge the government to consider further action in this fight. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  I'll give the right of reply on behalf of Minister O'Connor on the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill 2023. I want to thank everybody for their contributions to the debate. The bill is part of the Albanese government's work to ensure that Australians from all backgrounds are supported to achieve their full potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes in this bill facilitate the expansion of the trade support loan program, providing cost-of-living relief to more Australian apprentices and trainees. Trade support loans are interest-free government loans available to support apprentices in occupations of high skills need with everyday living expenses. Currently the Trade Support Loans Act 2014 restricts access to these loans to apprentices in trade occupations on the trade support loan priority list. This existing list of occupations has not been updated for a very long time. It's not responsive and no longer aligns with current or future skills needs. The amendments in this bill will replace the existing priority list with a new Australian apprenticeships priority list. The new priority list will be responsive to Australia's skills needs and will include key in-demand occupations that can be pursued through an apprenticeship or a traineeship. Occupations with current, emerging or future demand will be determined with regard to advice from Jobs and Skills Australia, ensuring a rigorous evidence base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes mean that we'll be able to support Australians training in priority non-trade occupations, such as aged care, child care and disability care, with an income-contingent loan to help them meet the cost of living while they train. By extending eligibility, the bill will assist many women, as women predominantly take up non-trade apprenticeships and traineeships and currently lack the support of these loans. To reflect the expanded eligibility, the bill will rename trade support loans to 'Australian apprenticeship support loans'. The bill will also make the program fairer by enabling the flexibility to provide immediate support to apprentices who missed payments due to issues outside their control, such as due to administrative error.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note some of the issues that were raised by the member for Fowler. Obviously, governments can't support second reading amendments, because they effectively negate the bill, but there are issues contained within that second reading amendment that I'll briefly refer to. Trade support loans are indexed on the same basis as other student loans, and are a small subset of those loans. Any changes to the operation of indexation of these loans would be a much broader piece of work, involving significant cost to the taxpayer. It wouldn't be appropriate to deal with this matter as part of the bill before the House. I also note that the Minister for Education has asked the Australian Universities Accord Panel to consider the operation of HECS-HELP loans. The panel's work is ongoing, with an interim report due mid-year and a final report due by December 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the expanded Australian apprenticeship support loan program, the government is boosting access to the support available to apprentices and trainees to complete their qualifications. It's also better targeting that support towards occupations where there is the greatest skills need. I welcome the opposition's public statements of support for the bill and hope that their support will facilitate swift passage of the bill through the other place to ensure that apprentices and trainees receive this cost-of-living support as soon as possible. Once again, I thank all members for engaging on the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="198084" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  I rise on behalf of the opposition to speak in support of the Statute Law Amendment (Prescribed Forms and Other Updates) Bill 2023. This bill will make minor amendments across 85 Commonwealth acts. These types of bills come before parliament from time to time. Indeed, in 2021 the former coalition government introduced a very similar bill, which lapsed at the end of the 46th Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are six schedules in this bill. Schedule 1 aims to reduce the number of provisions that require the use of forms that are prescribed by regulations. By way of example, one of the items in this schedule will see an amendment to the Health Insurance Act of 1974 to remove the words 'prescribed form' and substitute 'approved form'. The amendments in schedule 1 amend provisions to replace forms prescribed by regulations with other approaches, such as empowering regulations to directly mandate the requirements themselves and empowering ministers and other senior decision-makers to approve forms by notifiable instruments, which is consistent with the view of the Attorney-General's Department that prescribed or approved forms should appear on the Federal Register of Legislation. This is in keeping with modern drafting practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main purpose of schedule 2 is to update language relating to persons with disability to focus on the person rather than the disability across numerous pieces of Commonwealth legislation. These updates do not change the meaning of the relevant provisions. Updates give effect to the recommendations by Economic Justice Australia in its August 2022 research report, <span style="font-style:italic;">'Handicapped': use of outdated terminology in social security law and policy</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 will amend Commonwealth acts that refer to Northern Territory acts to reflect changes that the Northern Territory made to citing its acts. This, again, will change neither the purpose nor the intent of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedules 4 to 6 make amendments to remove technical errors across numerous pieces of legislation and to release obsolete acts or spent and obsolete provisions of acts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, as we know, from time to time drafting errors occur or obsolete provisions of acts do not get repealed when they are replaced. Provisions to clean up these errors are routine. The amendments in schedules 4 to 6 enhance readability, facilitate interpretation and administration and promote consistency across the Commonwealth statute book. The changes in this bill are minor and technical and do not impact the intent of any statute. Accordingly, they will not change the meaning of the relevant legislation except to the extent that they reduce the reliance on forms prescribed in regulations. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  I'm pleased to speak on the Statute Law Amendment (Prescribed Forms and Other Updates) Bill 2023. The Statute Law Revision Act and statute stocktake acts like this one have been passed since 1934 in order to remove obsolete and spent provisions from the statute books and correct drafting mistakes. That's five years before World War II, when Joseph Lyons was the Prime Minister of the time. So it's nothing unusual. We've been doing it for nearly a hundred years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments are minor and technical in nature and make either no change or only minor changes to the substance of the law. It's really legislative housekeeping. They're traditionally non-controversial, but, at the same time, they're essential to keep the Commonwealth statute book accurate and up to date, and statute law revision and update bills like this play an important role in enhancing the clarity and efficiency of the statute books. To that end, this bill amends 85 Commonwealth acts to enhance administration and promote consistency across the ream of Commonwealth statutes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Statute Law Amendment (Prescribed Forms and Other Updates) Bill makes technical and minor amendments. Firstly, it updates references to prescribed forms in the statute law of the Commonwealth to reduce the number of provisions that require forms to the prescribed by regulation, replacing such requirements with other approaches, such as allowing forms to be approved by notifiable instruments; secondly, it updates references to persons with disability in the Family Law Act, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 to promote inclusive language that focuses on the person rather than the disability, consistent with modern drafting practices and guidance from peak disability bodies; thirdly, it updates references related to the Northern Territory legislation and Commonwealth legislation consistent with the way the Northern Territory government and the Northern Territory now cites its own acts of parliament; fourthly, it makes minor and technical amendments to 33 Commonwealth acts and repeals certain obsolete acts and provisions; fifthly, it amends 12 acts to remove spent and obsolete acts; and, finally, it repeals the bill for acts of parliament and enhances reliability, facilitates interpretation and administration, and promotes consistency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has a number of schedules. Schedule 1 amends provisions in 33 acts that require forms by regulation and replaces them with the best practice approach for particular forms. These amendments implement modern drafting practices in relevant circumstances, such as providing for forms to be approved by a specified person or body by a notifiable instrument or enabling regulations to directly mandate the requirements themselves rather than require particular forms. They ensure that there is still oversight of the information to be provided while enabling flexibility in updating and improving forms. However, before minor updates or significant improvements can be made to these forms, further regulation will need to be made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this limitation, when drafting modern legislation, careful consideration needs to be undertaken to make sure each specific form must be prescribed to whether the situation might be dealt with using another approach. The amendments in schedule 1 reflect this. They also contain some associated minor consequential and technical amendments to support the operation of amended provisions. For example, application provisions are included to clarify when the requirement to use the prescribed form ceases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 is an important schedule because it updates our understanding and makes sure our statute books reflect our understanding of disability. Schedule 2 updates languages relating to persons with disability by replacing languages that we would not use today in modern Australia, focusing on the person rather than the disability. For example, the object of the amendments in schedule 2 is to prevent negative impact on the lives of people living with disability resulting from the way they're referred to in legislative provisions. So these amendments are not intended to change the way those particular acts that relate to people living with disability interact with the Commonwealth government, but the updated language is intended to be consistent with the recommendations of disability advocacy groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The schedule 2 amendments reflect a report that was done by Economic Justice Australia in August 2022 called <span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Handicap</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ped'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: Use </span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">f </span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">utdated </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">erminology </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nd </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ocial </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ecurity </span><span style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span style="font-style:italic;">aw </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nd </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">olicy</span>. The report found that language that placed disability before the person created a barrier to full participation in society by suggesting a person is unlikely to succeed because of disability. That's simply a disgrace. We want to make sure that the legislation that deals with people living with disability reflects the reality. So three pieces of Commonwealth legislation are going to be omitted as a result of this: the Family Law Act, the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlement Act. For example, provisions that include 'handicapped' are going to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 updates references to the Northern Territory and the way they deal with legislation up there. Schedule 4-6 corrects technical errors made as a result of drafting and clerical mistakes—just occasionally the parliamentary draftsmen get it wrong—and repeals obsolete acts and spent and obsolete provisions of acts. It improves readability and facilitates interpretation and administration of the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that the opposition spokesperson made reference to what they were doing previously and the sort of stuff that they would do, because who can simply forget those omnibus repeal days. We spent day after day, every year, listening to former Prime Minister Abbott, the member for Warringah, and Joe Hockey, and the whole of their backbench and frontbench, spend their days—this is what he referred to—talking about what they were doing and that they were getting rid of red tape. It was astonishing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was instead of doing a clean-up like we did. When we were last in government, we got rid of 16,800 pieces of legislation, legislative instruments and regulation. We did most of this stuff in the Federation Chamber, I might add. What they did, on this particular stuff, when they were in government was a big hullabaloo, political puffery of the greatest note. They would come in here and say they were going to save something like $1.8 billion of taxpayers' money by red tape repeal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember one occasion—as the shadow minister for ageing, at the time—where, with all the legislation they were going to change, they were going to save about $350,000 for the taxpayer because they were changing aged-care certification on building. So this sort of legislation we're dealing with today is exactly how we should do it: sensibly, in a modern way, doing it by way of schedule, not the grandiose political puffery we saw from those opposite when they were in and claiming they were doing amazing things. They were doing nothing of the sort. You had to go to the explanatory memorandum and look at the legislation to see what they were doing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We didn't mind, for example, fixing up hyphens, semicolons and full stops, and making sure that redundant sections and sunset clauses went, and getting rid of legislation that didn't operate anymore. All this stuff was minor. It was important stuff but it was minor—legislative drafting errors, referring to a section that didn't exist or a piece of legislation that didn't operate anymore. This is what you do. Good governments do that stuff—not the nonsense that went on from those opposite that the previous speaker referred to. It was just rubbish. The red tape repeal day was the biggest waste of taxpayers' money you've ever seen in all your life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased we're doing this today, because it makes sense. It literally makes sense to get rid of redundant legislation, to make sure it reflects the modern mores of Australian society. People living with disabilities should not be called handicapped. We should not have legislation on the statute books that says that. If there are acts of parliament that make it difficult for people to interact with the Commonwealth government because they're hard to read and outdated, get rid of them. Do it in a sensible, respectful, mature way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't pretend to the Australian public you're doing something you're not, which is what we saw with the posing and preening from those opposite that the previous speaker referred to. We did it as well? We're not doing what they did. We're not deceiving the Australian public about how much money we're saving. They said, 'We're getting rid of all this red tape,' when they weren't doing anything of the sort. Exactly what we're doing, by this legislation before us today, is the right thing, the mature thing, the respectful thing, the sensible thing. The coalition would have had you believe they were saving billions of dollars—until you read the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular legislation before the chamber is really important. It is action that will make a difference to the lives of people. It's not window-dressing. It's delivering reform—not like the hollow legacy of those opposite when it came to statute law revision. Everyone knows that red tape reveal days were rubbish under those opposite. They're ideological nonsense. They were code for Commission of Audit deep cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What they should have been doing is what governments of both persuasions, Labor and Liberal, should have been doing from the days of Jo Lyons in 1934: simply making amendments to ensure that statute books reflected reality, to make it easier for business, to make it easier for community groups, to make it easier for state and territory governments and local governments, making sure that we did the right thing, making sure that the legislation was nimble and agile. It wasn't about platitudes. It was about making sure it reflected the reality of society's contemporary views. So this legislation is important. Often, policies and programs increase barriers to business, so there needs to be the proper reduction of red tape. No-one thinks there shouldn't be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example—I can give a couple of illustrations—the crowdsourced funding legislation introduced a lot of onerous red tape for startups. Feedback from the startup and crowdfunding sectors at the time was that the legislation was riddled with undue compliance costs, administration costs and regulatory burdens, and that it had introduced additional reporting requirements for small businesses. Some said the red tape contained in it would force startups to jump through hoops, and it would be a significant deterrent to startups. So much for making it easier for businesses to raise capital. That's the sort of change we need to make. Remember: if you don't get it right, if you raise people's expectations, if you say you're doing one thing and you're not doing that, the public loses respect for you and you lose political support. It's no wonder those opposite eventually got turfed out. This was supposed to be a measure of red tape reduction, but the reality under those opposite was very, very different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The system we need makes sure that we have legislation in the statute books that deals with serious problems. When people interact with the government, whether it's through the myGov or myTax online service portals, and they don't work and leave many users literally tearing their hair out, it's important for the government to listen and make sure that policies, programs and legislation reflect the reality. A consultative and collaborative approach to small business is about delivering practical measures to help business owners, operators, employees, community organisations, people living with disability and community organisations that deal with people living with disability get the help they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But for those opposite, red tape reduction mania infected every aspect of their government, including in the area of aged care, and look at what the royal commission said about the way that they dealt with aged care. I remember particularly in 2015 those opposite claimed a raft of measures were red tape reduction as part of their Aged Care Amendment (Red Tape Reduction in Places Management) Bill. That's what they did—things like the Aged Care Amendment (Red Tape Reduction in Places Management) Bill. Gee, that made a difference to the aged-care system in this country in 2015 and thereafter. It sure did. That's why the royal commission made well over 100 recommendations to fix a chronic, complex, difficult-to-navigate system. That's what the royal commission found about those opposite and their management. So much for the Aged Care Amendment (Red Tape Reduction in Places Management) Bill 2015. Even on areas of statute law revision, they couldn't get it right. They even tried to claim those measures in that particular bill were delivering—can you believe it?—$4.5 billion in savings, when it was only $63 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality of the matter is that what we did when we were last in government and what we are doing now is what coalition governments and Labor governments did in the past. In the area of aged care, one of the biggest administrative burdens is the My Aged Care website, and those opposite couldn't even fix that. It's very important that we do everything we can to make sure the statute law is not clunky, is not unsafe, is not time-consuming, and is easy to understand. I am all in favour of reducing red tape for small businesses, for aged care, for people living with disability and for consumers, but the coalition, the Liberal and National parties, were all about announcements and no delivery. When it comes to statute law revision, those days annually were one of the best examples of how those opposite failed to govern effectively for the benefit of the Australian public.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence, Assistant Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Assistant Minister for the Republic</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  The Albanese government has a clear and consistent plan to improve Australia's natural environment. We've already introduced our changes to emissions reduction, with a target being set for a medium-term and longer-term target. We're introducing new vehicle emissions standards. But we're also keen to prepare our natural environment, and the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 goes to the heart of ensuring that all Australians can participate in nature repair. It's not just a role and a job for government to be involved in rejuvenating the ecology of Australia. It's also an area where, in particular, private businesses and individuals can be involved. This challenge that we've set, of safeguarding 30 per cent of Australia's land and seas by 2030, is one that all Australians can participate in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Globally, the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity has adopted the same goals, highlighting the urgent concerns raised in the 2021<span style="font-style:italic;"> State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport</span> about environmental degradation and inaction. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act review by Professor Graeme Samuel underlined the role that businesses and the private sector, and their investments, can play in halting environmental decline. Private companies, conservation groups, farmers and landholders are already looking at ways to make positive changes to their practices, to conserve Australia's natural environment. The nature repair market will lean on science and invite Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to share, on their own terms,  their unique knowledge about the ecological challenge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By legislating the market, we'll secure its ongoing integrity, stimulate investment in nature and inspire environmental enhancements across Australia. The Clean Energy Regulator, an independent statutory authority seasoned in handling such environmental tasks, will issue tradeable biodiversity certificates to Australian landholders, and these certificates can then find their way to businesses, organisations, governments and individuals. Every landholder, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, conservation groups and farmers, can join in this market. The projects they undertake could include weeding, planting native species and controlling pests: projects that are expected to deliver and yield long-term nature-positive results. This includes projects on land and water and bodies such as lakes, rivers and marine and coastal environments. The market will boost regional Australia with job creation and nature-positive economic activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations Australians will have a lot to offer in regard to this challenge, and they'll find the nature repair market offers employment and economic opportunities. In my electorate, in Botany Bay, at the moment there's a project being undertaken, a partnership between the University of New South Wales and the Gamay Rangers, the Indigenous rangers group, whose role and responsibility is to protect and conserve the natural environment around Botany Bay. They've undertaken a partnership project to restore the seagrass to Botany Bay over time. It's been interesting to talk to some of the scientists from UNSW who are leading this project and get their views about the benefits that they've received from listening to and sitting with elders and the Gamay Rangers and hearing their perspective not only on ecological conservation but on cultural conservation as well. That has fed into the project and is achieving positive results, a great example of how First Nations Australians can contribute to ecological repair.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I rise to welcome a development at the Adelaide City Council to progress the important effort of having Harry 'Breaker' Morant properly recognised on the Boer War memorial on North Terrace in your electorate, Deputy Speaker Georganas, of Adelaide. Breaker Morant enlisted in the South Australian Mounted Rifles and served in the Boer War. He was then recruited into the Bushveldt Carbineers, and many people are aware of the story, which was immortalised in a novel and a film. I don't in any way suggest that that is the correct history of Breaker Morant. Nonetheless, regardless of the fact that, yes, he was court-martialled and executed and there is some disputed history around that, the reality is that he beyond question served the colony, as it was then, of South Australia and he should be recognised on that monument on North Terrace. The city council are no longer standing in the way of that. They're recommending that the state planning authorities resolve that. I think that it's extremely appropriate that he's recognised on that monument, and I look forward to that decision being made in the near future.</span>

Last weekend we celebrated the Greek GleNTi. That's right: the GleNTi is back. Opa! I was hoping Deputy Speaker Georganas was still going to be in the chair. He's enjoyed the Greek GleNTi in the past. But you're always welcome, Deputy Speaker Claydon. The Greek community in my electorate goes back many generations. One example of what an incredible multicultural place we live in is that I did the Greek Zorba with a West Timorese Australian councillor on the Darwin City Council and with my daughter. We did the Zorba together while eating great lamb. It was a fantastic event. I want to give a quick shout-out to the Kalymnian club of New South Wales, who made the trip up to Darwin and were such fantastic dancers.</span>

India@Mindil is a massive celebration of our wonderful and diverse Indian community this weekend at the Mindil Beach market. We also have the supercars on this weekend, which is a massive sporting event. So, as everyone can see, there's something for everyone in the Top End. You're welcome to come up to Darwin. See you soon.</span>

The institute bears the name of one of south-west Sydney's most prominent families and was, in particular, the dream of Bob Ingham, who was born in Casula. The institute is a world-class research facility and has forged unique partnerships with universities and hospitals, and it is committed to improving health outcomes for those living in the south-west. The institute's brief is wide, from cancer, injury, rehabilitation and mental health research to conducting hundreds of clinical trials. Its success has been the result of wonderful philanthropic gifts but also of outstanding leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the institute announced that its longstanding CEO, Mr Darryl Harkness, would retire on 30 June. Darryl has been the CEO since 2017, after nearly 30 years with Johnson &amp; Johnson. In that time, Darryl has been a champion for the institute and Bob Ingham's dream. He has overseen the growth of the institute and can be proud of his record. He will leave the institute on a very secure footing. I very much appreciate Mr Harkness's support and conversations since I've been the member for Werriwa. I wish him all the best for his retirement, but most especially calm seas.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Despite allergen safety needing to be taken extremely seriously, concerned constituents have provided me with photographic evidence showing that dividers between shellfish and other seafood in the Woolworths deli are insufficiently high enough to prevent cross-contamination. Indeed, the photos even show crayfish tails physically touching scale fish. That's a big deal because, according to the National Allergy Centre of Excellence, shellfish is one of the most common food allergies in Australia and a major cause of food induced anaphylaxis, with symptoms including breathing difficulties, shock, severe swelling, nausea, dizziness and even death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've raised these concerns with Woolworths and the federal health minister, but in both cases the response could only be characterised as dismissive. Yes, I understand the threat of cross-contamination can never be fully eliminated, but for Woolies not to take this matter seriously—for example, by installing higher barriers, as Coles has done, and training staff better—is quite frankly dangerous and disappointing in the extreme. Indeed, Woolworths is playing Russian roulette with public safety, which is why I urge the government to take immediate action and amend the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code to require much more effective separation of shellfish from other foodstuffs. The issue here is not about hygiene; it is about a genuine and serious threat to human life.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I'm proud to be a part of a government that is taking action and recognises that we are in a climate and biodiversity emergency, and I am proud that we are doing something meaningful about it. I would also like to acknowledge the many members of local governments from across Australia who have converged on Canberra for the Australian local governments conference, some of whom join us in the gallery today. Local governments are connected to our communities and, like Darebin city council and the City of Port Phillip which service my electorate, these councils have led in this debate across recent times. They declared a climate emergency as early as 2019. Local governments across Australia have followed suit, leading the calls for action in the absence of leadership under the previous Morrison, Turnbull and Abbott governments. We are changing that and we are heeding the calls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise the urgency required for us to act and we are implementing detailed policy across all areas of government. Whether it be implementing the legislated target towards net zero; the establishment of an environment protection Australia, the first of its kind federally; doubling the funding for the marine science institute; setting a target of zero extinctions; the new bill to create markets for landowners to undertake biodiversity projects; and so much more, we are showing leadership where the previous government completely declined even to show up. So I say 'thank you' to those all around the country who are leading this debate. We have a lot more work to do, and we will partner with other governments to get this done.</span>

They are articulate, compassionate and inspiring, and typical of the young people I meet every day in my community. Indeed, in a recent youth summit, people from across North Sydney spoke with me about the issues facing their generation, with environmental concerns high on their agenda. One student actually shared with me that she had moved to Australia two years ago only to face a barrage of bushfires and flooding, which completely crushed her ideal vision of Australia. Another worried about the rapid rate of deforestation and extinctions. These voices are the future, and we all have a responsibility to hear them and take action to protect the planet they will inherit. I encourage my fellow parliamentarians to heed this petition.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  Today I want to congratulate Nunawading Basketball, based in my electorate, at East Burwood Reserve. This past long weekend Nunawading Basketball hosted the Nunawading Spectres tournament for 2023, and what a tournament it was. The event attracted 9,154 participants across 817 teams, including 357 girls teams, utilising 69 basketball courts—an enormous achievement. This event continues to go from strength to strength, and now boasts the title of the largest single club tournament in Australia. Further demonstrating the growing popularity and status that this event now holds, it also attracted 296 participating teams from interstate, in addition to international participation from four under-18 girls teams from the United States of America.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that a tournament of this magnitude is a massive undertaking and requires an extraordinary level of commitment, so I need to mention the tireless efforts of CEO Mark Hallett and his team in pulling off this amazing event, as well as the participation and contribution of the referees, officials, volunteers, coaches and, of course, the participants themselves. At present, Nunawading Basketball facilitates competitions and programs for nearly 12,000 players, coaches and officials on a weekly basis. Congratulations to all involved on their outstanding contribution to basketball and to our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  I rise today to speak on an issue which is causing grave concern to large parts of my electorate: the way that wind farms are running roughshod over local communities in their efforts to get these wind farms up. With the Mount Fyans wind farm—and I have a petition here with over 400 signatures to it—the company is not listening to Indigenous owners and community groups. In the Shire of the Moyne, where all these wind farms are going, there is not one household which is benefiting from cheaper power. I say to all those people: think what it would do to your local communities if they were being industrialised by transmission lines and by these wind towers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most recently, we have seen a proposed wind farm at Garvoc, where they put the planning application in and then went to the communities and told them what they are doing. My communities have had enough. That is why I will be tabling this petition, with 400 signatures, to say: do your consultations properly. Don't plant your transmission lines right across our patch. Don't industrialise our electorates. Do it, do it properly, and do not see all the benefits go to the cities, where, if this were happening there, they would not tolerate it.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I wear the Qantas uniform just like my other colleagues but I earn substantially less than what they do. We all do the same job, we work the same hours and take on the same responsibilities. But my paycheck, worker benefits and rest periods are significantly different. My role was Cabin Leader on the last shift I worked, which means you have more communication with the flight crew, ground staff and more responsibility for the cabin. But my colleague who is employed by a different subcontractor is getting almost double what I'm earning. On that day I was in a higher role than her, but she was out earning me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I love my job, I enjoy going to work with my colleagues and interacting with passengers onboard. But it's hard to be in love with your job, when the company doesn't care for its workers. It's hard to respect Qantas when it's employees' pay, benefits and contractors are so different yet we all look the same and do the same work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That experience is something many in this chamber should think about the next time that they're flying. In the country of the fair go we have a responsibility to fix loopholes like this. This is what the same job, same pay legislation will fix.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Our first responders are out there every day, leaving their loved ones to go and support their community through its time of greatest need. We talk a lot in this place about mental health support for defence members and veterans—and rightly so—but the same can't always be said for those who serve in our emergency services. That's where Fortem comes in. Fortem is a not-for-profit organisation that supports the mental health and wellbeing of first responders—the people who protect and care for Australian communities. Fortem has recognised the gap in support services and is filling that gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Townsville we're the biggest city that is furthest away from a capital city, which is why Fortem decided to set up shop in our city. But it nearly didn't happen, as the Albanese Labor government threatened to pull the former coalition government's commitment of $10 million in funding for Fortem. We took up that fight last year and the government backflipped and now an office and personnel being on the ground in Townsville are just months away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week we marked Thank a First Responder Day as a nation, a day to show our support to those who dedicate their lives to protecting us and keeping us safe. It was great to join James from Fortem along with the opposition leader and local first responders for a thankyou barbecue held at Queensland Fire and Emergency Services' regional headquarters. I look forward to working closely with this great organisation as it supports those who support us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  I am so proud to represent an inclusive and supportive community in Melbourne's north-east. Recently Eltham Library scheduled a drag story event as part of marking IDAHOBIT Day. Like many such events planned across Melbourne, this event was targeted by people spreading messages of hate. This was obviously very distressing for our local LGBTQI+ community, for our library and for our council staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So our community got together to demonstrate that we are not about hate and to make sure that people spreading divisive messages of hate did not drown out our messages of support. Together with my state colleague Vicki Ward, local councillors and members of our local community, we brightened the entrance of Eltham Library by drawing rainbow butterflies in colourful chalk in an act of solidarity and friendship. Our community rallied behind our LGBTQI+ community to say, 'We stand with you,' and I know so many in our community continue to stand in solidarity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locally, we continued to celebrate our LGBTQI community at the QWere Street party in Montmorency recently. It was great to see creative activities, live music, festival stalls and, of course, great company. Thanks go to Banyule council, traders, performers, stallholders and everyone who made this occasion a real highlight. I'm proud of how my community celebrates each other and how we respond to acts of hate with acts of love. To our rainbow community and our rainbow families: I stand with you today and always.</span>

Cath has been a passionate advocate for the people of Logan. To use her own words, everybody needs a chance. I've always admired Cath's unwavering passion for her community. She has achieved an incredible amount over the past two decades, including her AM for significant service to youth, social welfare and the community.</span>

I am confident that he will build on Cath's work, retaining the YFS values, and I wish both Cath and Christopher all the best as they embark on the next chapter of their professional lives. I'd like to thank Cath in particular for the enormous amount she has done for the community of Logan and surrounds over the years, and I wish her all the best for her future.</span>

Firstly, we have Mrs Helen Banu-Lawrence for her tireless volunteer work with St John Ambulance since 1974. She was a chief executive officer for StreetWork Australia and chairperson for the headspace Chatswood consortium. Then we have Ms Juanita Davies for her service to aged welfare through her volunteer work and time as a director of Leigh Place Aged Care. We then have Mrs Janelle Dodd for her ongoing service to the community through her work with Days for Girls and her active involvement in the Eastwood Uniting Church and as an honorary member of Rotary Club of Ryde. We have Mr John Dodd for his ongoing commitment in his local Rotary community. John served as chair of the district governor selection panel, as well as in many other roles within Rotary and as president of the local Rotary Club of Ryde branch. We then have Mrs Rita Lepedjian, founder of the Ryde Hunters Hill Symphony Orchestra. Rita served as founder and chairperson of the orchestra but also as the first female president of the Australian Armenian Chamber of Commerce, as a teacher of Armenian folk dance and as president of the Armenian Educational and Cultural Society's Shant Chapter. Then we had Peter Stroud for his service in rowing. He's been involved with rowing for over 50 years, and is head coach of Drummoyne Rowing Club. Of course, I'll give a little shout-out to Maxine McKew AM, a former member for Bennelong, for her ongoing commitment to journalism and the parliament. Thank you to all honourees for your work in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  I wish a very happy 10th birthday to the Mount Gravatt Men's Shed. 10 years ago, Brian Wheeler and other local community members came to me with an idea to start a men's shed in Mount Gravatt. Now I'm happy to say that the Mount Gravatt Men's Shed has grown to over 360 active members and is a very important part of our community. From building chairs and tables for community groups to fixing lawnmowers and fences and restoring old machinery, the Mount Gravatt Men's Shed is the perfect example of how community supporting community makes a difference. It's so much more than just a simple workshop; it's a sanctuary. Crafted out of old-fashioned mateship, men's sheds provide a safe, welcoming space for men to come together, chat and engage in meaningful connections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know men are less likely to talk about emotions and their struggles or to ask for help when they need it most. That's why men's sheds are so important. They bring together individuals who might otherwise feel lost or disconnected, providing them with a sense of purpose and belonging. This helps to combat social isolation, depression and other mental health challenges that men just don't want to talk about. With seven men committing suicide every day across Australia, we all must and need to make sure that institutions like men's sheds are supported, are well funded and continue to grow. I'd like to thank everyone who has contributed to the success of men's sheds across Australia. Thank you very much.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  I don't know who the world's greatest living writer is today, but on Monday it was Cormac McCarthy. On Tuesday, it wasn't. So this Wednesday I say a few words about the loss of one of my favourite ever writers and one of our truly great artists. Cormac McCarthy delivered few words to the world, but every one in his 12 novels, five screenplays and three short stories was precise, pointed and poignant. Many encountered his words via film, for those that don't read. It's rare for a classic novel to become a classic film, but that's what happened in <span style="font-style:italic;">No Country </span><span style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span style="font-style:italic;">or Old Men.</span> Cormac's few perfect words on the big screen worked. However, it is when as a reader we encounter McCarthy's words on the page that they become truly transformative, their most beguiling and their most challenging. His novels are sometimes bleak, often brutal and occasionally even hilarious. The scene with the violated watermelons in <span style="font-style:italic;">Suttree</span> will curl your eyelashes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world is all the poorer when a great artist dies, as we won't be gifted any more of their art. Thankfully, Cormac recently put out two new works, and we can always revisit his earlier work, which is what I intend to do. If you haven't yet encountered Cormac McCarthy's work, find a nice sunny spot when you're feeling okay with the world, dive in slowly and start swimming. I don't know who the world's greatest living writer is right now—I'll keep reading until I find them—but I'm sad that it's no longer Cormac McCarthy. Vale, Cormac McCarthy, and thank you, sir.</span>

Congratulations to the Gruyere Fire Brigade, the Lilydale SES, the Yarra Glen Bowls Club, the Toy Library of Belgrave South, Katu Katu, the Montrose Men's Shed, Seville Community House, Sherbrooke Suns Basketball Club, the ADRA Community Care Centre, the WHYLD Community Group in Woori Yallock, the Yarra Glen Men's Shed, HICCI, Koha Community Cafe, the Woori Yallock Football Netball Club, Yarra Valley Railway, Upwey Men's Shed, Ben's Shed in Yarra Junction, Morrison Men's Shed in Mount Evelyn, the Southern Dandenongs Community Nursery and the Woori Community House, amazing organisations full of volunteers who give their time to support our community and help those in need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate all of those organisations but also give a shout-out to all the volunteers and community groups in Casey who give so much of their time to make sure that we have the strength of community that is part of our culture. The sporting clubs are really the heart of our towns. The CFA and the SES are there when we need them, whether it's fires, floods or storms like the June storms of 2021. We know our community groups step up. This is a small way that we can support them financially, because every dollar that we're able to provide through grants is one less sausage that they need to sell at Bunnings and allows them to do what they love. So congratulations to all those community organisations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  The Fair Work Commission recently announced an 8.6 per cent increase to the minimum wage and a 5.75 per cent pay rise for those on award wages, the biggest increase in history, helping 2.7 million Australians with the rising cost of living. It's no secret that inflation is putting pressure on Australian households. However, despite what those opposite would have you believe, it is not exorbitant wages for our lowest-paid workers that are driving inflation. In fact, real unit labour cost, the average cost of labour per unit of output produced in the economy, is six per cent lower than it was pre pandemic. As the RBA has noted, most of the inflation in our economy is being driven by supply-side factors such as the war in Ukraine and busted supply chains which are a legacy of a decade of Liberal neglect. Despite some of the commentary from the Liberals and others, working Australians are not to blame for the inflationary pressures in our economy, and paying them less is not the solution. The Liberals spent nine years in government deliberately suppressing wages, cutting support and underfunding health and education. Now, not satisfied with that inglorious record, the Liberals want to continue punishing working Australians from the opposition benches. The Albanese government has a plan to clean up this Liberal mess. After inheriting a $77.9 billion deficit and a trillion dollars of Liberal debt, we'll get on with fixing our economy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  I rise to speak about a valued and important volunteer based organisation in my electorate of Pearce. The hardworking, dedicated volunteers of the Two Rocks Volunteer Marine Rescue Group ensure our boating community is safe on the ocean. As their proud patron, and together with the Western Australian emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, I was invited to speak at the official naming and blessing ceremony for Marine Rescue Two Rocks' new vessel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Neptune</span>. This highly anticipated vessel with sophisticated technology replaces <span style="font-style:italic;">Sea </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">II</span>, which served the fast-growing community for 18 years. <span style="font-style:italic;">Neptune</span> will vastly improve marine safety in the community of Pearce, which has 32 kilometres of coastline. The $750,000, 8½ tonne aluminium hulled vessel has the latest electronics that will help achieve faster, life-saving rescues in time-critical situations on the Indian Ocean.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In further welcome news, the group have been successful in securing a federal grant of $17,000 to purchase a radio direction finder for their radio room base. This, combined with their RDF on board, will provide a quick triangulation to find a distressed vehicle. I received a very grateful note of thanks to the federal government from the Two Rocks Volunteer Marine Rescue Group for awarding this much-needed life-saving grant.</span>

Last week, the Leader of the Opposition met with a Townsville cafe owner whose electricity bill has surged by 404 per cent. Despite the Prime Minister's promise to cut power bills by $275 each year, the Albanese government has had 12 months and two budgets to fulfil this promise but has failed to do so. With small businesses struggling and Australian families having to find an extra $22,000 each year to service their mortgage, let alone pay electricity bills, when will the Prime Minister take responsibility for the growing cost-of-living crisis?</span>

One of the things that this government is doing is taking action. We provided $1.6 billion for energy efficiency upgrades for homes and businesses, including the small business energy incentive. We had the Rewiring the Nation program, of course. We're rolling it out, bringing the energy grid into the 21st century. We introduced, as well, our plan to provide certainty to encourage investment through the safeguard mechanism. Importantly, as well, we had our Energy Price Relief Plan, which shielded Australia from the worst of global price spikes that have occurred with price caps that nearly halved wholesale forward prices for electricity. We provided up to $3 billion in targeted rebates for households and businesses, up to $500 in bill relief for eligible households and up to $650 in bill relief for small businesses.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can imagine people in Queensland today are giving a big shout-out to the Palaszczuk government and the announcements that they've made overnight, which will, for some pensioners, reduce energy bills to zero. That's as a result of what they have done in partnership with this government.</span>

                  </a>  So I'm sure that when the member for Herbert returns to Townsville on the weekend he'll be able to say: 'I'm sorry, constituents, that I voted against the Energy Price Relief Plan that's making a difference, but I do recognise what a fantastic job the Palaszczuk government is doing.' They've used some of the revenues as well—again, things opposed by those opposite. As a result of the windfall gains that are there because of global energy prices, Queensland have produced the largest budget surplus of any state government anywhere since Federation. But of course they don't recognise something called a surplus over there, just like they didn't recognise the projected surplus from our Treasurer, who can't even get a question about the budget that he brought down a month ago.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that those opposite failed when it came to productivity. It's a big, defining feature of the wasted decade of missed opportunities that they were responsible for. If you won't take my word for it, Mr Speaker, then listen to the shadow finance minister, Senator Jane Hume. She was asked by Tom Connell:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are paying a hefty price indeed for this wasted decade under those opposite. They delivered the slowest decade for productivity growth in the last 60 years. While it will take some time for us to turn this around, we are absolutely focused on building a stronger and more productive economy. We are progressing in some form more than two-thirds of the 29 reform directives outlined in the Productivity Commission's five-yearly inquiry because we understand that productivity equals prosperity. But we on this side of the House also understand—this is the difference—that building a more productive economy isn't about hacking away at people's wages and conditions, it's not about making people work longer hours, and it's not about making them work harder for less money.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will get the right kind of productivity growth in this economy in time by investing in the skills and capacities of our people and supporting our businesses to innovate and grow so that we can manage and maximise some of the big shifts that are underway in our economy: the growth of the care economy, the possibilities of data and digital, and the vast industrial and economic opportunities that come from the transformation to net zero. That's the reason behind our policies, like fee-free TAFE and vocational training; investing in the industries of the future, like hydrogen; and supporting businesses to adopt new digital innovations, like artificial intelligence. This government has a plan to make our economy stronger and more productive so that we can lift incomes, lift living standards, build more successful businesses and clean up the mess left behind by those opposite.</span>

When you look at what the budget papers actually say in the question that's reflected by the shadow Treasurer, they refer to what expectations are by economists. It's not a Treasury document and it's not in a media release from the Treasurer.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:13</span>):  I thank the member for Swan for her question. She's a terrific new member in this House, doing a terrific job representing the people of her community in WA. She knows that after nine years of cuts and neglect to Medicare from those opposite, it has never been harder to see a doctor than it is right now. This means that now, more than ever, every dollar spent in health is precious. That's why the member for Swan and the team on this side went to the last election promising to strengthen Medicare, and we delivered on that promise in the May budget with a $6 billion package to strengthen Medicare. The centrepiece of that package was $3½ billion dollars to triple the bulk-billing incentive. We remember on this side of the House the father of the modern Liberal Party, John Howard, describing bulk billing as an absolute rort. We remember the Leader of the Opposition, in his first budget as health minister, trying to abolish bulk billing altogether. But for Labor, bulk billing is the beating heart of Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, the contrast between our budget and the approach of the former government could not be clearer. They cut billions of dollars from Medicare with a six-year-long Medicare rebate freeze, but they found $2 billion to build a fund to take to the 2019 election that will allow them to travel the country announcing their hand-picked project. As at the member for Swan said, last week, the Audit Office published a scathing report into this program, just the latest in a series of funding scandals by the Morrison government that breached even the most basic principles of public administration. The report details project after project where no expressions of interest were sought—no suitability assessments were made at all. The department was forced to monitor the media, to watch the TV, to learn which projects had been announced by the government as they travelled the country. The Audit Office found that, of the 63 major projects, only two ended up being assessed as highly suitable—only two out of 63. They found that administration of the other 100 grants were, and I quote the Audit Office report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… not appropriate, involving deliberate breaches of the relevant legal requirements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, as we saw right through the period of the Morrison government, the delivery of this program was hopeless, because it was always about the announcement with this government, always about the media release and never about changing things for ordinary Australians. Well, we are implementing all of the recommendations from the Audit Office. Each one of the remaining projects from this program are assessed for value for money for taxpayers. We are determined to clean up the mess that was left to us by the former government, because, as the member for Swan said, every dollar spent in health is precious.</span>

Prime Minister, was it absurd when you coordinated with the states to cap energy prices? Has the ACT Labor-Greens government nationalised the private rental market with its rent controls or did national cabinet nationalise housing when it coordinated a freeze in five states and territories during the pandemic? Will you finally act on rent increases at national cabinet and freeze rent increases with the states?</span>

That's why we adopted a net zero target by 2050, and that's why today I was very proud to announce the chair and advisory board of the Net Zero Economy Agency.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, the government committed to this agency, in our budget, to establish it from 1 July. Its mission will be to ensure that the Australian economy, our workers and our regions are in the best possible position to realise the benefits that are there for moving to a net zero economy. It will make sure we're channelling investments into transformational projects, creating pathways for the workers and businesses that have powered Australia for generations to take advantage of these new opportunities.</span>

We went to the election last year promising to deliver cheaper medicines to millions of Australian patients. In July last year we managed to cut the safety net for millions of pensioners by 25 per cent. The maximum amount pensioners will pay for all of their medicine needs across the year is now only $5.05 per week. We cut the price of 2,000 brands of medicine in September, delivering $130 million back into the pockets of hardworking Australian patients. And, as I might have said once or twice at this dispatch box, on 1 January we delivered the biggest cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the PBS.</span>

                  </a>  The Leader of the Nationals said we all support cheaper medicines, but, when that advice was provided to the former government five years ago, they decided to do nothing about it. Instead, they required all of those millions of patients to traipse to the pharmacy every single month and, over those intervening five years, pay hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in co-payments that the advisory committee overseeing the PBS said were unnecessary. This is a policy that will halve the cost of these chronic disease medicines for millions of patients. It's a policy that will improve their health. We have said that every dollar saved by the Commonwealth will be reinvested into community pharmacy. We're in the process of finalising the detail of that, talking with pharmacy groups across the sector, particularly focusing on smaller rural pharmacies to make sure that the impact on those rural pharmacies is mitigated. We want a viable community pharmacy sector. Instead of politicising this issue, maybe the opposition should work with us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment and Water</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:30</span>):  Thanks to the member for Fremantle for that terrific question. I know no-one is more committed to ocean conservation than he is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been a huge couple of weeks for ocean conservation in Australia. Last Monday, our government officially announced our decision to triple the size of Macquarie Island Marine Park, adding an area of highly protected ocean larger than the size of Germany. This is one of the most important decisions that will be made for ocean conservation anywhere in the world this year, and I am very proud of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Macquarie Island is a unique place. It's the only island on earth where royal penguins breed. It's one of the few places where endangered albatross come to land to rest. It's the home of elephant seals, killer whales and a whole range of other rare fish. We are talking about a place that is globally unique and globally significant, and with this decision we are massively increasing our protection of the endangered animals that call this beautiful place home. It's why the Australian Marine Conservation Society called it 'a massive win for the region's globally significant marine life'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, we had another piece of very encouraging news to share with Australians recently, about our efforts to increase protection for the Great Barrier Reef. Last week, the head of UNESCO praised our government's policies, saying that our policies to combat climate change, improve water quality and protect endangered species are significant. Previously, UNESCO said that the difference between the new government and the previous government, the old one, was a bit like night and day, and that is certainly the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, we took our efforts even further by investing, with the government of Queensland, $160 million to make sure that we are reducing high-risk fishing activities on the reef and supporting more sustainable practices. The new funding means that the reef will be free of gillnets by 2027. Gillnets are an absolute menace for dolphins, dugongs, turtles—for a range of endangered creatures—and that's why we're stepping in to ban them. WWF called our decision 'a globally significant moment for ocean conservation, fisheries management and the Great Barrier Reef'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, our government is proud of these efforts to better protect nature—to protect what's precious, to restore what's damaged and to make sure that we're managing nature better for the future.</span>

The principle that was dealt with yesterday goes to the actions of a minister before they became minister, and that was what all the points of order yesterday were about. The question today that has just been asked is about the actions a minister is taking now to fix up a mess that was left to this government.</span>

I want to be clear for all members regarding <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span>, which makes clear what ministers cannot be asked questions about in relation to their actions—and it states this very clearly on page 554—in a former ministerial role or as a private member before becoming a minister. That's also on page 554. This question is about what the government is doing now. The minister is responsible, obviously, for these portfolio responsibilities. I'm going to listen carefully to her response to make sure she's updating the House with her remarks, however she answers it, regarding the policies, but she's obviously able to talk about what the government's responsibilities or her responsibilities are to deal with the relevant issues, as she sees fit. The question is in order, but I'll listen carefully to make sure she is being relevant.</span>

I understand why this is such a touchy subject for those opposite. If I had wasted a decade on the benches behind me, then I would feel pretty touchy about it too. What I can tell you is that we have a bunch of ministers sitting here who will be proud of their record after sitting on these benches and proud to have our record examined by the opposition when that time comes.

                  </a>  and she's very intimately involved in the debate and the discussion about these subjects. Unfortunately, she is right in her description because, when we arrived in office a year ago, we found cybersecurity in an absolute mess. That is a serious problem for our country because anyone involved in this space can tell you that cybersecurity is one of the most important national security challenges we face. We've got a packed public gallery today. It is statistically probable that every person up there or a member of their family has been the victim of a data breach or a cyberattack over previous years. Given how that was left, I can understand why those opposite don't want to have their record questioned. I say particularly to the opposition leader who sits opposite me and who likes to present himself as a bit of a tough guy that we know we had no cybersecurity minister under the previous government. The opposition leader was the home affairs minister for much of their time in government. This national security matter is in a mess, and there is no-one more responsible for that mess than the opposition leader.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has had real consequences for our country. We had the National Australia Bank tell us a year ago that they are subjected to 50 million cyberattacks a month, and the Australian Taxation Office is subjected to three million cyberattacks a month. So our focus over this last year has been trying to clean up the mess left by those opposite and to set us on a path for doing better as a country. That's why we've set up 'hack the hackers', a task force of Australian Federal Police and Australian Signals Directorate officers—a hundred people who are out there finding people who are seeking to do Australians harm and trying to hack back. We've taken leadership of a global ransomware initiative for the first time. Australia is trying to coordinate the actions of countries around the world who share those same threats. We have declared 82 systems of national significance—things like our electricity grid and the providers of water—to make sure that they are taking their cybersecurity responsibilities seriously. We've begun national cyber exercises for the first time, where industries around this country are coming together to work out how they will cope with these challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just what has been done over this previous year, but there is so much more to come. A really important moment for the country on this matter will be the release of the cybersecurity strategy a little later this year. There is huge focus and energy and resolve on this matter for the first time. We're cleaning up the mess left by those opposite, but most importantly, we're making sure that in this internet age we're providing proper safety and security for our constituents.</span>

This is a very serious topic. It requires an adult response, and it is important that our friends and our adversaries understand that this parliament stands united in the fight against the scourge of criminal activity online. The same rules should apply online as they do in real life. The targets that we see of institutions and systems of national significance are very real, and when we are in government, we put $9.9 billion into the Australian Signals Directorate—I know it's not a great deal of money—we bolstered the funding to the Australian cybersecurity system and we spent more on cybersecurity than any government in the country's history. So we stand united in the fight against those criminals online.</span>

                  </a>  We're back to where we were yesterday. It's the same point of order that I took yesterday. Whether a statement has been made outside the House or inside the House, the rules in <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> are the same when it refers to something before somebody became a minister. It is that the question has to be about the statement. It can't simply be a reference to the statement and then a question about something else. Exactly the problem that arose yesterday arises with this question, only it's about a statement inside the House rather than outside. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> treats the two identically when it refers to something where the event itself occurred prior to the person becoming a minister.</span>

                  </a>  I'm going to ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to rephrase the question to make sure it is within standing orders. These questions are problematic. I'm just going to ask her to make sure that she's either referring directly to a comment or quote within the statement so that it can be relevant. To simply refer to the statement and ask something else is not within the standing orders. So I'd just ask her to rephrase the question to make sure it is relevant.</span>

There is a longstanding convention that questions can be asked about answers that were given in question time the day before or at any other previous time. This question refers to public statements that the minister has made and answers that she gave yesterday relating to those public statements, and at the heart of the question are her answers from yesterday.

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, in the previous parliament a very similar situation arose where a question was asked of a minister in relation to what the minister had said previously. That was the subject of some deliberation, and the then Manager of Opposition Business had this to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">that information. That is precisely what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is doing in the question that she has asked. The proposition that the then Manager of Opposition Business put was upheld, and it should be upheld today as well.</span>

                  </a>  The difficulty I have, as I explained to the House yesterday, is that, whilst a minister may give a remark or statement to the House, she can be questioned about those words. You can't add extra things on to that statement about information you may wish to have or undertake, because the minister was not responsible at the time. She's responsible for her words and actions since she's been a minister but also in the House. I'll give the Deputy Opposition Leader one more time to rephrase the question, not to add another question into a statement that she answered yesterday. It's got to be about the statement. It is very narrow about what she can ask.</span>

I'm pleased to report to the honourable member that his constituents, and all Victorians, have avoided price rises in relation to electricity of $555 per household. For small businesses in Victoria, it's $955. In other states, the savings have been even bigger. Take South Australia, for example. Because of the intervention of the Albanese government last year, a projected 51 per cent price rise for those receiving the government's rebates has changed to a three per cent cut in energy prices in South Australia, which is a $992 saving for people in South Australia. And there are similar figures across the board: $843 of increases avoided in New South Wales, $819 in Queensland $488 in Tasmania and so on. These are important savings for households and small businesses.</span>

Expert after expert has been making the point that it is directly the intervention of the government which has led to this bill relief—expert after expert has said that it is the intervention of the government. We saw Clare Savage, chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, said that it's this policy which reduces power prices—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Steven Kennedy, the Treasury secretary, has said that the intervention has reduced inflation by reducing power prices directly and clearly.

He was interviewed on Sky News, and it was a rather difficult interview for the member for Fairfax on Sky News. He gets the tough questions: he was asked about the impact, and he conceded that energy prices were down. But he had a causality problem; he said, 'There's no evidence that the intervention itself was the thing that got prices down.' So he conceded that prices were down but he denied that—</span>

Last week the ANAO report revealed that the Morrison government acted unethically and unlawfully in administering the $2 billion CHHP grant scheme. Your government has repeatedly condemned the Morrison government's heinous pork-barrelling. Are you open to structural changes, such as legislating spending on large grant programs, to stop this from ever happening again?</span>

One of the key features of our much more responsible approach to managing the budget is to make sure that we get value for money when we allocate public money, whether it's via grants or in other ways. The honourable member raised in her question the Community Health and Hospitals Program, a $2 billion fund which attracted a fair bit of criticism from the Audit Office. My colleague, the Minister for Health, has now addressed that on a couple of occasions, and I know that in the aftermath of that Audit Office report—in light of it—he has asked for more work to be done to make sure that we don't have a repeat of that kind of situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also know that my terrific colleague the finance minister is doing a heap of work to take into consideration the advice that has been provided via recommendations from the Public Accounts and Audit Joint Committee's report on <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">administration of government grants</span>, as well as the Audit Office report <span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ward of funding under the Building Better Regions Fund</span>. The Minister for Finance has asked her department for advice on the most robust way to provide these kinds of grants from the budget into communities right around Australia, and I think that's appropriate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also know, via our work on the Expenditure Review Committee and in other ways, that a number of colleagues in the cabinet and in the ministry are doing the necessary work to make sure we do things differently to our predecessors—that we do have a much more robust case when it comes to allocating public money and that we're getting value for money when we make those decisions. That is an important part of the work that we have been doing for the best part of a year now, and there will be more work to do on that front as well, whether it's considering some of the proposals that are put to us in good faith, to make sure that this is robust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish on this point, Mr Speaker: one of the reasons this country didn't have enough to show for a trillion dollars in debt is the approach of those opposite. The party that used to be born to rule became born to rort, and that's why it has taken us, and is taking us, the necessary time to clean up the mess that they left behind. That applies to the provision of grants in the same way that it applies to other aspects of our responsible economic management.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:56</span>):  I thank the member for Bennelong for his question. I just want to take a moment to recognise how hard the member for Bennelong fights for families and children in his electorate and the number of times he has stood in this place to speak out for and behalf of the families and children in his electorate. It's wonderful to serve with him in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In around two weeks time our reforms that raise the childcare subsidy and make early childhood education and care more affordable for 1.2 million families across Australia will take place. That's 9½ thousand families in the electorate of Gellibrand, that's 7,000 families in Moncrieff, that's 5,600 families in Mayo, and that's 265,000 families in rural and regional Australia. We made those changes because we recognised that for too long the cost of early childhood education had been way too high, putting pressure on families who were already struggling with the rising costs of living. Our changes will see the maximum rate of the childcare subsidy increase to 90 per cent for families earning $80,000 or less and will extend the childcare subsidy to families earning up to $530,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But these changes will do more than just reduce costs, because a great early childhood education and care system pays a triple dividend. First of all, it sets up Australian children for a great start in life. We know that because the evidence tells us that. Secondly, it helps families get ahead. And, importantly, it builds our economic prosperity by supporting workforce participation and productivity. That's particularly the case for women, who are generally the primary caregivers. We know that the high costs of early learning often act as a massive disincentive for women to get back into the workforce, to take on more hours or more days, or to go back to study and increase their skills if they so wish. More affordable early learning means that families can get extra income. Women can go back to work and add to the family income if they so wish. They can build their careers and they can build their retirement savings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government take women's economic security seriously, and we believe in providing a choice for Australian women. By boosting the childcare subsidy, we will make a real difference to Australian families. We're proud of everything that we've achieved in just over a year, delivering on our election commitment to make early childhood education and care more affordable, but we know that there's much more work to do.</span>

How is this consistent with the Prime Minister's statement yesterday, 'Katy Gallagher has been transparent in relation to this matter'?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare that with the lack of transparency opposite, with the Gaetjens inquiry. The former PM could have asked his staff at any time what they knew; instead he asked his former chief of staff and then secretary. The review was suspended twice. On 25 May 2021, Gaetjens told estimates his report would be completed 'as soon as possible' and that he thought it would be 'weeks, not days—certainly not months'. Three months passed before the review was suspended. The failure to release any findings shows the inquiry was never intended to shine any light. The government failed to answer 57 questions on notice from Senate estimates dating back to 22 March 2021. This parliament has open to it, of course, to call for documents— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

She brings a depth of experience as a former dairy farmer, small-business owner and teacher and as a passionate advocate for the people of the South Coast and the Shoalhaven.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She is right. The government inherited a mess in the area of financial advice. We saw financial adviser numbers absolutely in freefall. Ten thousand left the industry on that government's watch. They had a huge gap. People were seeking financial advice and couldn't access it, couldn't afford it. They had regulation after regulation that was providing red tape but not consumer protection, and, in the area of the transition to a professionalisation of the service, layer upon layer upon layer of mess. Is there any wonder that 10,000 professional financial advisers left the industry?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is going to clean up the mess that the other mob left us, and we have started this week. This morning I introduced legislation into the parliament to help smooth the professional transition and ensure that experienced advisers can stay within the industry—a proposition that was put and ignored by that mob over there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also announced our response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Quality of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">dvice </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eview</span>, and I can advise the House that we're adopting 14 of the 22 recommendations. There will be three streams of work that proceed from this. First, we will be removing that red tape that adds no consumer protection from financial advisers. It's something that this mob could have done but refused to do. It means that professional financial advisers will be able to get on with doing their job without unnecessary red tape.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our priority's in stream 2, I've got to say. Five million Australians are either at or approaching retirement with more money than ever before, because of Labor's transformative superannuation reforms. The average Australian is retiring with $200,000 in retirement. Every single dollar was opposed by that mob over there. What they need is access to information and advice, and we're going to enable them to get it from there superannuation fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been well received by the industry and by consumer groups. The Financial Services Council has said this: 'The government is right to prioritise its stream 1 reforms, which will lower the cost of providing financial advice and improve consumers' experience.' Choice, the consumer body, has said this: 'We welcome the federal government's sensible and measured approach to improving consumer outcomes.' The Financial Advice Association has welcomed the reforms as well.</span>

The National Anti-Corruption Commission will commence in less than three weeks time.

Seven months later, we are still waiting. Will these protections be in place before the NACC starts and, if not, why not?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is committed to strengthening Australia's whistleblower framework, and that's why we introduced, last year, the Public Interest Disclosure Amendment (Review) Bill 2022 into the parliament. This bill will improve protections for public sector whistleblowers and witnesses and it will enhance the oversight of the scheme by the Commonwealth Ombudsman and by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, the Greens party delayed these vital whistleblower reforms in previous sittings, ensuring that the bill did not become law a month ago. The Public Interest Disclosure Amendment (Review) Bill 2022 was stranded in the Senate as a result of days of filibustering by the Greens party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this, the government is continuing to work on delivering long-overdue reforms to the Public Interest Disclosure Act to improve Australia's whistleblowing framework for the public sector, which, as the member's question indicated, will support the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission. I'm very pleased to again tell the House that the National Anti-Corruption Commission will commence operations on 1 July 2023. This legislation, the Public Interest Disclosure Amendment (Review) Bill 2022, would ensure that improvements to the public sector whistleblower scheme are in place for the commencement of the National Anti-Corruption Commission on 1 July 2023, and I would urge all senators to support this bill to ensure that it does pass this parliament in time for the commencement of the National Anti-Corruption Commission on 1 July 2023.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd just add this: following passage of these amendments, the government will commence consultations on a second stage of whistleblower reforms, and this will involve redrafting the Public Interest Disclosure Act to address the underlying complexity of the scheme and provide effective, reasonable and accessible protections to public sector whistleblowers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  I thank the member for Solomon for his question. He has always been a fierce advocate for the north, and he knows, as I and other people in this House know, that developing the north is critical to our nation's prosperity, security and future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister for Northern Australia, I'm committed to leading an agenda for developing northern Australia that focuses on delivering sustainable and resilient growth, and that is why I re-established the Ministerial Forum on Northern Development. In our second meeting since getting elected, we met in Kununurra, on Miriwoong and Gajirrabeng country. We discussed key priorities, including the increasing momentum of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility in enabling a diverse range of infrastructure projects right across the north.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I introduced a bill in parliament earlier this year amending the NAIF to deliver on the Albanese Labor government's commitment to ensure that the NAIF is best positioned to maximise economic outcomes right across the north of this country. These amendments to the NAIF Act will increase the NAIF's appropriation from $5 billion to $7 billion; add the Indian Ocean Territories as part of the meaning of northern Australia; and, very importantly, clarify that NAIF's financing of northern Australia's economic infrastructure is to benefit Indigenous persons and that this is an additional objective of the NAIF Act. This bill, currently before the Senate, very importantly has bipartisan support which will ensure its passage through this parliament, and it will set, as we work together, the foundation for a better future for those in northern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is still more to be done. The government has provided the NAIF with a statement of expectations, highlighting our priority to transition Australia's energy sector toward net-zero emissions by 2050. NAIF projects that will support this objective include $610 million into the Genex pumped hydro project in Kidston in Queensland and also $37 million in Merricks Capital's Hudson Creek Power Station and the Batchelor solar farm for Darwin and the Northern Territory. Unlike those opposite, who used the veto of NAIF against a wind farm project outside Cairns, we believe in climate change and are acting to meet our net-zero commitments, and the NAIF is doing its part in this regard.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also doing its part to address housing shortages. It is investing in student accommodation in northern Australia. Forty-six million dollars of NAIF funding has been provided to James Cook University for a student accommodation facility in Townsville. It has provided over 400 rooms for students studying in North Queensland, with high-quality communal facilities including self-catered kitchens and dining spaces. There were 348 jobs created in the construction of this facility, and the total net benefit to the Townsville economy is estimated to be over $140 million. And we continue to use the NAIF to invest in critical minerals projects which will be needed to drive the energy transformation of this country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="231027" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TAYLOR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  Australians are hurting. As I get around Australia and as I get around my own electorate, I ask, 'How are you feeling versus a year ago?' I get a very consistent answer. They feel poorer, because they all know they have rising mortgage costs, they have rising fuel bills, they have rising prices at the checkout and they have rising taxes. For everything they buy, goods or services, they know they are paying more under this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know a typical hardworking Australian family trying to get ahead is $25,000 a year worse off than a year ago. Finding that in after-tax income is a monumental feat, and we have to pay tribute to those hardworking Australians who we know are working more hours and digging harder into their savings because this government has given up the ghost when it comes to fighting inflation. They talk the talk but they never walk the walk, and any attempt they have made to put together a plan to fight inflation has failed at the first hurdle. We have a Treasurer right now who is more interested in banning cheques and writing 6,000-word essays than he is in fighting inflation. This Treasurer is a doctor of spin, not a doctor of economics, and it is showing, because we have seen his budget fail within a month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw your attention to page 56 of Budget Paper No. 1, which talks about interest rates, and it highlights the expectations that interest rates would 'remain at 3.85 per cent until early 2024', from which time they will fall. This was in the budget in May, but, in just a few short weeks, we saw that fall apart, with interest rates going up to 4.1 per cent, and we have an expectation now from economists and the markets that we'll see further rate rises into the future. And it is no coincidence that this happened immediately after the budget, because the budget failed. It didn't deliver on the promises it made, and this is what we are seeing from this government time and time again, whether it's energy prices, the budget or mortgage costs. They make the promises and then they walk away and don't take responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week we saw the national accounts come out. What we saw in that was that the Australian economy, on top of the fact that we have raging inflation and rising interest rates, is shuddering to a halt. For the last quarter, we saw GDP grow at 0.2 per cent. Here's where it gets very real, because it's GDP per person that counts. That's what people feel, and that has stopped. It's going backwards. We have a government here that is overseeing an economy it inherited that was strong. It is now shattering to a halt. Australians are now working more hours in a week, in a day, than they have since 1978. That's what they have to do to make ends meet. They're digging deep, because that's what Australians do. Australians are resilient, but they need to be resilient in the face of this government. They have to fight hard just to hold things together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we've seen Australians saving less. In just a year, we've also seen a total collapse of labour productivity under this Labor government. In the last 12 months alone, labour productivity dropped by 4.6 per cent—and that's negative! Under the previous government, we saw an 11 per cent gain in labour productivity across our time in government. Almost half of that was wiped out in a single year under this government. It's no wonder that Philip Lowe, the Reserve Bank governor, using polite central banker speak that he does, is saying, 'Hey, under those circumstances, I have no choice; I have to raise interest rates.' That's what this government is delivering, and it needs to take responsibility for the situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would have thought that with that kind of collapse in productivity, the Treasurer or the Prime Minister would show some interest in finding out more about it. But it turns out that the Treasurer, having seen the Productivity Commission bring down one of its most important reports—every five years it reports on productivity and brings out thousands of pages in that report—has not even bothered to meet with the chairman of the Productivity Commission. He hasn't even bothered to talk to him! He hasn't even bothered to do it. The truth of the matter is that this government doesn't care. It is all politics, not policy, because the Treasurer, as I say, is a doctor of spin, not a doctor of economics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to look at how Australia is doing versus the rest of the world. The Prime Minister likes to talk about this, but it's important to go to the facts. The facts are that Australia has a core inflation rate—which is the number that economists look at—running at 6.6 per cent. In the March quarter, we saw the US at 5.6 per cent, we saw Canada at 4.3 per cent and we saw the Euro Area at 5.7 per cent. In fact, we see Australia leading the world in exactly the wrong way. I am not always inclined to quote ABC Fact Check. On this one, I will. They have made it very clear that Australia is leading the world in exactly the wrong way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at historical comparisons—which those opposite love to do—between our time in office and this government's time in office, the average inflation rate over the coalition's nine years in office was 1.85 per cent. The average inflation rate over the first four quarters of the Labor government is over seven per cent. The average cash rate over the coalition's nine years in office was 1.34 per cent. After one year of Labor, it has risen to 4.1 per cent. As I said earlier, across our nine years in government, labour productivity increased by 11 per cent and total factor productivity increased by five per cent. In one year alone, we've seen a minus 4.6 per cent collapse in labour productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad the member for Parramatta is here because he understands that, if you have that kind of productivity loss and you want to deliver higher prosperity to Australians, you simply can't do it. This is a catastrophic collapse, and it's a catastrophic collapse under this Labor government. When you look at what's behind it, we know that inflation is coming from Canberra. It's not coming from the Kremlin. From this government, we saw $185 billion of additional spending in this budget—$2 of additional discretionary spending for every dollar of saving. We've seen economist after economist say that the most generous thing you can say about this budget from Labor in terms of fiscal policy is that it hasn't helped. Well, they promised that they were going to fight inflation first, and that's not what we've seen. We're seeing industrial relations productivity. They are taking us back to the toxic industrial relations environment of the seventies and the eighties. That's showing up in the numbers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former productivity commissioner Gary Banks has told the AFR:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The current flurry of regulatory changes, under the banners of 'getting wages moving', 'job security' and 'equality', are likely to impede the flexibility and 'dynamism' that is integral to productivity growth and higher real wages—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  Can I just say to the collective bright brains trust that was sitting opposite: when they say 'fight out the ideas' they don't mean physically attack the shadow Treasurer. I'm really sorry to see that he is under that ailment. What I was expecting to see when we were discussing the topic of inflation here today was that, unlike what we saw in the budget reply, maybe, just maybe, the opposition was going to come and say, 'This is our idea to fight inflation.' I thought it might even be possible that, if they weren't going to disclose an idea, they might have come forward and given a hint that maybe the shadow Treasurer is the Josh Lyman of Australian politics and actually had a secret plan to fight inflation. But, no, there's no plan, there's no secret plan and there's been no costing of their ideas. This is an opposition that is completely out of its depth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that getting on top of the inflation challenge is a central focus for a government and a budget in handling our economy. But it's worth the opposition reflecting on the fact that the highest level of quarterly inflation was under the previous government, in the March quarter of last year. Theirs is the record of ignominy when it comes to inflation. In fact, the level of inflation in the March quarter of 2022 under the last government was the worst quarter for inflation this entire century. That is the record from which they come into here and purport to lecture us on handling the inflation issue that is confronting our economy and confronting all Australians right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, being clear that this is a problem that started under the last government, it's important to realise that they didn't do anything to address the shocks that our nation has been confronted with externally over some time. There were the supply shocks generated by COVID. There is the war in Ukraine, which has had a global inflationary effect. But, of course, we've also had the pent-up savings that occurred during those COVID lockdown periods across the country. But did the previous government, seeing these things occurring, do anything in terms of its economic settings, in terms of the way it delivered its budgets over the last decade to make sure that Australia was set up to deal with these challenges? No, it didn't. It's got no ideas whatsoever about how to deal with these important issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On our side of politics, however, the centrepiece of our second budget is a $14.6 billion cost-of-living package over the next four years that will ease pressure on Australians whilst putting downward pressure on inflation. People are under the pump; we acknowledge that as a government. We've carefully calibrated and designed this budget so that it takes pressure off the cost of living rather than adding to it. This budget prioritised responsible, targeted cost-of-living relief while also investing in the future, securing the services that Australians rely on and strengthening our nation's finances. The cost-of-living measures in our 2023-24 budget included the largest investment in bulk-billing incentives ever, delivering $3.5 billion to triple the bulk-billing incentives and help 11.6 million eligible Australians access a GP with no out-of-pocket expenses. To put that in real terms, in my own community in Burt that will assist over 90,000 people. We've also tripled the veterans' access payment to make it easier for veterans to access a GP. We're reducing the cost of medicines by up to half for at least six million people. We're spending up to $3 billion on electricity bill relief across the country. We're seeing that retail price increases are now expected to be 25 percentage points lower than what we would've seen if we'd had the 'no policy' approach of the previous government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget includes $4.9 billion to increase the base rate of several working-age and student income support payments like the JobSeeker payment and youth allowance by $40 a fortnight for eligible recipients. Again, for ordinary Australians in my community that will help over 9,000 people. In the 2022 budget delivered by Labor we also increased the annual totally and permanently incapacitated pension payment by $1,000, providing financial assistance to our most injured veterans. Our budget included $2.7 billion to increase the maximum rate of Commonwealth rent assistance by 15 per cent, and a $1.9 billion investment in the single parent payment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that from 1 July, which is only a few weeks away now, we're making child care cheaper for 1.2 million Australian families. They will be better off as a consequence. That will assist over 6,000 families in the electorate of Burt. This will have an immediate impact on the hip pocket of young families. And it concerns me that the relevant shadow minister for this area continues to criticise this policy. It's a real 'have it each way' approach from this opposition. They walk in here and whinge about a policy that is going to provide cost-of-living relief for Australian families: a childcare subsidy policy that is going to make it cheaper to access, make it easier for families to access and make it easier for both parents to be able to continue to pursue their careers. It is a productivity-lifting policy, yet they come in here and complain about it. Of course, the opposition couldn't vote against it because they know how good a policy it actually is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This will help maintain an affordable, high-quality early childhood education system across Australia. Investing in child care isn't just about assisting young Australians; it's also good for our economy. It boosts productivity and workforce participation—critical, as even the shadow Treasurer pointed out, for helping deal with these issues of inflation. In fact, Treasury estimates that our cheaper childcare plan will add some 1.4 million hours per week in terms of the workforce. That's the equivalent to putting an additional 37,000 full-time workers into the workforce. It's about taking all of those matters into account, as the Reserve Bank governor did. When asked about our budget, he made this very interesting and telling point: 'I don't think the budget is adding to inflation; it's actually reducing inflation in the next financial year.' That's completely the opposite to what the shadow Treasurer was trying to maintain earlier. Treasury's advice is that our policies to ease cost-of-living pressure are expected to directly reduce inflation by three-quarters of a percentage point in 2023-24. So the shadow Treasurer, who likes selectively quoting out of the budget papers, might want to refer to those particular figures as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, inflation is still higher than any of us would like, and it has been more persistent than would be ideal. That's why we are putting downward pressure, in our budget, on inflation. It's why we are making these meaningful differences to the families that need support most, by providing this cost-of-living relief in our budget. Australians also understand that, when the Reserve Bank of Australia makes its decision in respect of interest rates and the cash rate, that is a decision that is made independently of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I started to say before, the coalition likes to 'talk it up', by selectively quoting some statistics from its record in the past decade when they were in government. Let's just think about what ordinary Australians—mums and dads and Australian families—saw in the economy and in their own hip pockets under a decade of this last government. They saw flatlining and anaemic wage growth. They saw a circumstance under the last government where the cost of living was still going up, but nothing was happening to help them pay for those increases in the cost of living. They had completely flat wage growth and flat growth across the economy. This was a previous government that did not understand the need to support ordinary workers across the economy. In fact, it wasn't just something that happened under their term of government; it was a deliberate policy position of the last government to keep wages low, to keep the incomes of Australian families low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's just reflect on that versus what we have achieved in just one year of being in government. We've successfully advocated for wage increases for minimum and award wage workers, and a funding pay rise for aged-care workers. We are delivering cheaper child care. We are delivering cheaper medicines. We are tripling the bulk-billing incentive to support 11.6 million eligible Australians. We are delivering fee-free TAFE and more university places. We are expanding paid parental leave. We're building more affordable homes through the National Housing Accord. We have brought in a new pensioner work bonus for older Australians so that they can continue working without affecting their pension. We are increasing the base rate for eligible recipients of JobSeeker, Austudy, youth allowance and other working-age payments. We are increasing the maximum rate of the Commonwealth rent assistance by up to 15 per cent—the biggest increase in over three decades. In partnership with state and territory governments, we are providing electricity bill rebates for more than five million households and one million small businesses. Our budget is delivering real cost-of-living relief. It's a responsible budget. It's a practical budget. That is not what we ever saw from those opposite.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:36</span>):  Australians are hurting. Right across the country, Australians are facing insurmountable pressure through the impact of inflation growing to 6.8 per cent in April. The cost of day-to-day living is ever increasing. Rising mortgage rates, rising prices at the checkout and rising energy bills are chipping away at already tight budgets. Constituents in my electorate of Capricornia are looking down the barrel of a 28.7 per cent increase in their electricity bills come 1 July. That's an additional $429 a year they will need to find at a time when inflation is smashing their cost of living. They are also paying eight per cent more for their groceries. For anyone living on the margins, every increase in the essentials means one less basic necessity. To make ends meet, Australians are working longer hours. In fact, Australians are working the most hours since 1978, but they aren't any better off for it. Make no mistake: times are difficult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This month the RBA announced for the 11th time another interest rate rise under this government. The decision to lift interest rates once again will leave many anxious as to what this means for the budget's bottom line. I anticipate there will be many difficult decisions being made in the coming months as families struggle to make ends meet. Australians haven't seen the light at the end of the tunnel, with additional interest rate rises in the pipeline. NAB is already predicting further hikes in July and August, and Westpac is signalling to customers to expect another increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leading into May's budget, Australians hoped to see policies that would effectively fight inflation and ease the cost-of-living crisis. Instead this Labor government delivered more pain on the hip pocket. The additional rate hike is the proof in the pudding that Labor's budget did nothing to ease the burden of inflation on the economy. Since coming to govern Australia, Labor have delivered two budgets. It was clear the policies delivered by those opposite have done nothing to fight inflation prior to the budget being released in May. Market expectation was that additional rate rise would be unlikely. The dramatic turnaround on these expectations, including the Reserve Bank decision to increase interest rates, proves Labor to be complacent with combating inflation. Once again, the Reserve Bank is forced to do the heavy lifting. This is the consequence of a government that has let inflation get out of control and has failed to take responsibility for addressing the biggest economic challenge facing Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economy is grinding to a halt as Labor allow inflation to consume the country. Because of Labor's complacency, Australians are saving less. The household saving ratio is 7.6 per cent lower than a year ago and almost 20 per cent lower than during the peak the pandemic. It's been 12 months since Labor was elected, and our nation is far worse off than a year ago. The March quarter annual accounts show that, after a year of Labor, the economy is growing at the slowest rate since September 2021, when both New South Wales and Victoria were in COVID lockdowns. At a time when Australians need every dollar they can get, their individual income tax has increased by 11.4 per cent since last year. That's less hard-earned money in the pockets of my constituents and more in the coffers of the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election, the country was promised it would be easier under a Labor government. Is it though? The reality is different to the dream Labor sold the public. Mortgage repayments, gas and electricity bills, supermarket and petrol station receipts, and insurance premiums are the evidence that we are not living in the utopia Labor promised. The number of businesses going into insolvency has almost doubled in over 12 months. A record number of mortgage holders are struggling to make payments. A typical Australian family with a mortgage and children is $25,000 worse off than it was last year. These figures are alarming, and yet we have a government which is failing to take strong and decisive action on fighting inflation. Hardworking Australians are paying a heavy price for this government's failures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under a Labor government, Australians will see real wages continue to stagnate, the cost of living continue to rise, gas and electricity bills continue to skyrocket, more unemployed and inflation sitting at elevated levels. What is needed is policies that we know are proven to work—policies that will help strengthen our economy, that will make sure our hardworking middle class isn't forgotten and that will provide tax relief. The coalition will support our resources industry, our farmers and our domestic manufacturers, and we'll make sure they can thrive and prosper here in Australia. We'll back small businesses and support households and families across Australia who are doing it tough under Labor's cost-of-living crisis.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  This is an important MPI put forward by the shadow Treasurer and it is one that talks on an important issue, but, as with all things with the shadow Treasurer, you really have to trust but verify some of the numbers coming out of the shadow Treasurer's office. I'm going to get back to that in a second—the real 'trust but verify' numbers coming out of the shadow Treasurer 's office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, let me say this. Inflation is real. It does hurt Australians, and that is why we have seen budgetary restraint and the leadership taken by the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance around banking some of the increased revenue that we've seen made not just by increased commodity prices but by Australians who are working harder and longer hours. There are more Australians in work. This is revenue that has been received by the government off the back of the hard work of Australians, and we want to make sure that we see Australians keep more of what they earn. That's why we've put so much effort into getting wages moving again and putting more back into the pockets of hardworking Australians. That is what we are doing, and we will continue to do that work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's go back to the shadow Treasurer just for a moment, because the shadow Treasurer has a bit of form on his management of numbers. Full credit to the opposition for putting as their head bean counter someone who has an interesting relationship with being able to calculate numbers. Who could forget when the shadow Treasurer famously came in not only to this place but to other places and said that the City of Sydney had spent $15.9 million on travel expenses? At first glance, you would think that's a little bit more than you would think for a council. A council shouldn't be spending $15.9 million on one year of travel. And you would think that someone in such a senior economic position in the government would be able to think their way through what that number actually means. What does $15.9 million actually translate to?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've done a bit of homework that, frankly, should have been done by the then minister's office. They're public servants, so you give them the flexi fare. You don't give them the inflexible fare from Jetstar. Let's get them on the flexi fare from Qantas and make sure that they can change their flights around. So $15.9 million at the $300 flexi fare between Sydney and Melbourne—because that's the most travelled route, you would think—translates to 53,000 flights that Clover Moore apparently took in one year. If you break that down one more level, the shadow Treasurer thought he had quite a scoop in saying that Clover Moore had taken 145 flights a day. Could you imagine getting on the plane to Melbourne, arriving in the most spectacular and cultured city in Australia and then having to go all the way back to Sydney, only to have to get back and do another 143 flights a day? It seems like a pretty implausible situation, yet that is what the shadow Treasurer led with. It's hardly surprising that on 2 November 2020, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> had a headline that said 'Angus Taylor v Clover Moore: WhatsApp messages reveal panic as minister's staff realise figures were wrong'. I can imagine that there would have been a bit of panic in the minister's office. There would have been quite a bit panic because, of course, it wasn't $15.9 million. The actual figures that were used by the council—the City of Sydney—were $4,206 for international travel and $1,700 in domestic flights. That's a little different from $14 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, like with everything this shadow Treasurer has to say, you have to be very, very careful with what he puts forward. I know that he has been in the vegemite jar this week. He has been right in there. He added a bit of mayo to the vegemite. That's what he did. It's an unusual combination, but it may have resulted in a few of his colleagues sending Andrew Clennell a few SMSs giving opinions about the shadow Treasurer. We shouldn't laugh. The shadow Treasurer can put forward all of his wacky theories. He's going to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House are always going to stand with the hardworking people of this country. We're going to take our budgetary responsibilities extremely seriously. We are going to keep working until inflation comes back down to appropriate levels, and we will keep backing hardworking Australians each and every day, because that's what a good government does.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  I thank the member for Hume, our shadow Treasurer, for bringing this very important matter of public importance to this House's attention: the inflation crisis which this government has caused. I have sat here and heard from a minister for veterans' affairs who spent most of his time making references. He made a fairly glib reference to <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">West Wing</span>. While I am very fond of Josh Lyman—one of the best characters in <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he West Wing</span>—I think that this matter of public importance did deserve a little bit more attention and a little bit more intellectual rigour than was brought. The member for Macnamara has now spent just over three minutes referencing and quoting various other supposed quotes from the shadow Treasurer, rather than actually addressing this inflation crisis and talking about what his government, after 12 months, is actually going to do about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are suffering. They are hurting. I have in the gallery today Mr Jack Smyth from my electorate who has come down here with his family, and what he has not heard from those opposite on the government benches are any answers as to how the government is going to address the inflation crisis. If we just look at some of the numbers and some of the facts after 12 months under the Albanese Labor government, the economy is shuddering to a halt. In the March quarter, the annual accounts show that, after a year of Labor in government, the economy is now at its slowest since September 2021, when New South Wales and Victoria were in COVID lockdowns. What answers does this government have to this crisis? So far, the answer is nothing. Because of inflation, a dollar today is worth far less than it was a year ago, and Australians around our country are grappling with mounting costs. If we look back at where we were a year ago, we are in a far worse position today on any measure, whether we are looking at mortgage repayments, gas and electricity bills, superannuation, petrol receipts or insurance premiums. These are items that people in my electorate are telling me every day are getting worse day by day and are far worse today than they were one year ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if the government does not want to listen to real people and does not want to listen to what people in my electorate are saying, let us consider what former Reserve Bank of Australia governor Dr Glenn Stevens said just last week. These are his direct words, a quote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… inflation is … way too high …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said that interest rates could remain elevated for some time yet. That's a direct quote from Dr Glenn Stevens. ANU economist Ashley Craig confirmed the government is making the RBA's job much harder, saying:</span>

The budget, therefore, has failed Australians at a time when they needed a government that's focused on fighting inflation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  This government is committed to easing cost-of-living pressures on everyday people. We know it is tough for people, and that's why we're providing sensible cost-of-living relief while not adding to inflation. In May we delivered a responsible budget, a budget which will ease the cost-of-living pressures without unnecessarily fuelling inflation. Yes, that's right, Deputy Speaker: this budget will address the immediate challenges this country faces, create more opportunities for more Australians and lay the foundations for a stronger, more resilient and more secure economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A key tenet of this budget is to put downward pressure on inflation, but don't take my word for it. The RBA governor, Philip Lowe, said, and I quote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I don't think that the budget is adding to inflation; it's actually reducing inflation …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The independent Governor of the Reserve Bank, whose job it is to look at inflation and determine what is inflationary, believes that our budget is actually reducing inflation. And this budget delivered a surplus, might I add?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But how are we delivering this relief? With some wonderful measures: investing in Medicare by tripling the bulk-billing incentive, reducing the cost of medicines, providing energy bill relief, lowering projected energy prices by intervening in the energy market, making child care cheaper, providing fee-free TAFE, and targeting relief to those most in need, like single parents and jobseekers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that these measures are already resonating in my community. Just last week I received an open letter from nine medical peak bodies with a collective membership of over 50,000 healthcare practitioners. The long and short of the letter is that these peak bodies are thrilled about our cheaper medicines policies, and I'll tell you why. Our cheaper medicines policy will save people money and time. It will also free up more local GP appointments, and it'll do this without being inflationary. From 1 September, eligible people will be able to receive two months worth of medicine on a single script. That's double the medicine for the same money. That's a big win. Cheaper medicines will halve visits to local GPs, freeing up appointments for those who need them most. We're also delivering Medicare urgent care clinics, including one at Batemans Bay. We're also funding a Head to Health clinic in Moruya, providing free mental health care for adults. But it's not just adults. We're well on the way to opening a headspace up at Kiama, so that's free mental health care for adults and adolescents. Better health care—that's something to be proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that isn't all of it. In the May budget you will have seen we're providing targeted relief on power bills, another measure that provides targeted relief where it is needed most. All Commonwealth seniors healthcare card holders, as well as many other concession card holders, will be eligible for energy bill relief and will receive up to $500 per household. But this isn't throwing money around for the sake of it. It is targeted spending, because this budget is responsible. We know people are doing it tough, and we want to provide relief. That's the Albanese Labor government, though. We're working to provide real relief where people need it, right when they need it. You can see this in our cheaper medicines policy, our tripling of the bulk billing incentive, our energy price relief, our intervention in the energy market and our cheaper childcare measures. The Albanese Labor government is getting on with what we were elected to do. We're delivering the change that Australians voted for. Our job is to look at what we can do with fiscal policy with our budget, how we can address the issue of rising inflation and, at the same time, how we can help with cost-of-living pressures. We've done just that. We assisted with sensible cost-of-living relief whilst reining in inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I've got a bit of advice for some of the others opposite. If you want to help Australian people, get your colleagues in the Senate to vote for the Housing Australia Future Fund. Not a day goes by where I don't hear a sad story about people needing to find somewhere to live but they can't. If the government really wanted to do something about inflation and cost of living, it would pass the Housing Australia Future Fund, which will increase the supply of affordable and social housing and help people survive.</span>

I am a little bit disappointed. As a matter of fact, I'm very disappointed, because every time you ask serious questions of those opposite about matters that are affecting the Australian people—the people that I love, and the people that I represent—all they do is smirk and laugh. We have the Treasurer there smiling and laughing when we ask these very, very important questions, and the Prime Minister doing the same. And they're supposed to be leading this country. But—no, no, no—that's not what they're doing. They think it's funny.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr WILLCOX:</span>
                  </a>  The economic powerhouse tree that you inherited from the previous coalition had low unemployment and maintained a AAA credit rating, and this was after a global pandemic. We saw low interest rates and low inflation. And now what's happened since the Albanese Labor government has taken over? We all know that Labor is not good at managing money. You've got form for that. We understand that. But nobody in Australia realised it would be this bad. What has happened to this flourishing economic tree? First of all, you started to ringbark it. You got the chainsaw out and ran the ringbarker straight around, and that was part of the first budget. That was when all the infrastructure projects, particularly up in my neck of the woods, were taken right out. They were totally axed. That's what happens when you don't create dams and when you don't build any infrastructure; there is less productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that wasn't enough. You decided to get the Tordon out to the tree, and you put the Tordon around it to see if you could kill the economic tree. That was the safeguard mechanism, or—let's call it what it is—the carbon tax 2.0. It's another dagger to the heart of business and of industry. That wasn't enough for the tree, so then you got the Velpar out, and put the Velpar around all the roots. That was the industrial relations policy, which makes it harder for small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt that the current government is only interested in people who are working for the government or in big businesses that it can unionise. In the end, they got the excavator out, didn't they? The Albanese Labor government got the excavator out and dug all the roots around. That was the final blow for the tree, the recent budget, and then the tree has fallen over. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have looked at it and gone: 'Holy smokes, look at this. We thought it was really strong but, no, we've killed it.' This budget has fuelled inflation with $185 billion in additional spending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has happened since then? There has been another rate rise, which is the 11th rate rise under this government. People in my area with mortgages of $500,000 are paying more than $1,100 extra per month. This is firmly at the feet of the Albanese Labor government. Don't be laughing about it. Do something about it. You're in government. You're supposed to be holding the reins and looking after the Australian people. That's what you're paid to do. In Senate estimates the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, confirmed that this discretionary spending in the budget was expansionary. You're making the situation worse. It needs to be better. Electricity prices are going up. Grocery prices are going up. Mortgages are going up. Take control and look after Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That's good news for communities like mine, where we have the highest number of mortgage holders in the country. More than 50 per cent of the households in the community that I represent are families in each household, and most have a mortgage. They have felt every rate increase. But the good news that is coming for communities like mine is that those who are working and being paid a modern award are now going to get a 5.75 per cent pay increase. That is how you deal with inflation. You put money into the pockets of the people who are working hard so that they can afford to pay these rate rises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's face it, in my community that won't be inflationary. People on award wages in my electorate won't be rushing out to buy a boat. No, they'll be paying their mortgage. They'll be finding that space again in the family budget. It is good news. That is how you deal with inflation in this country, by looking after the people in this country who do the hard work, the people who work in the economies that this country relies on, like the care economy. Of course, we also have coming in the care economy an incredible investment and commitment from this government that will see a 15 per cent pay rise for those working in aged care. That is how we are dealing with inflation. Those things are about priorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Budgets are about priorities. I've been in this chamber for nearly 10 years, and I've seen a few budgets and I've seen a few skewed priorities. I remember distinctly the 2014 budget that ripped funds away from the community sector in my electorate and left homelessness services with absolutely nowhere to go. I was meeting with CSOs in homeless and community services who were in despair about how they were going to support people on the ground. I remember that budget well. I remember the money being ripped out of my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it wasn't just one budget. It was budget after budget after budget where the priorities of the former government became very apparent. Not to put too fine of a point on it for the member for Dawson: this government didn't 'take over', mate. We were elected. And not to put too fine a point on it, the repetition of those budget priorities is what led to us being here, sitting on the government benches now and celebrating the fact that families in my electorate will get some relief under this government, that this government will take targeted action and show restraint and that this government will put money back in with a projected surplus to come, which is something those opposite failed to deliver in their nine budgets. They prioritised, not the people in my electorate—they didn't prioritise my community—but they prioritised other people in this country. That's what their priorities did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw that as late as just before the last election and we've heard about it this week—it's yet another example. For me and my community, the most egregious thing that we heard from those opposite in nine years was about the parking lots at train stations in inner Melbourne. These were going into communities that already had buses, trams and a station mostly 800 metres from people's homes. And they were going to get car parks, while out in the outer suburbs it was nothing! Not one car park at our train stations. We heard this week that the Community Health and Hospitals Fund has been through an audit process and that while those opposite undermined Medicare they were targeting spending by using their priorities. And none of it landed in my community—not one cent of it was going to come to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, they're not in government, and these will be reviewed dramatically to ensure that the things that were done under that government are stopped now, and that the priorities that support most Australian families will be delivered by this Albanese Labor government. And in two budgets we have started that work. Mark my words, we have a lot more work to do, but I'm really proud of the first 12 months and I'm really proud of my community and the way they're managing to live in this inflationary crisis. I'm here to support them.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I'll go to a topic that those opposite like to talk about a lot. They get upset when we call out the political spin of the $1 trillion lie of the debt they inherited. A few people yelled out before, 'What are the numbers?' so I will give them the numbers. The net debt you inherited was $514 billion, and 30 per cent of that was inherited by the former coalition government from the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. So those are the numbers; you can keep spinning the line as much as you like, but it's actually not true. You can go to the ABC's Fact Check and you can go to this wonderful thing called the budget papers to check those numbers. They all add up, so that's the number that you inherited. You can continue the spin as much as you like; it's not true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Veteran's Affairs spoke at the start of this debate and talked about how the biggest quarter for inflation was March last year. While that's correct, there's a pretty significant event that happened in the March quarter last year: Russia invaded Ukraine. Clearly, that was going to have an impact. He then went on to claim that the former government did nothing to support Australians. I seem to remember that there was this great initiative in cutting the fuel excise. That was immediate, and it gave relief to Australians when they needed it. It was temporary so as not to continue to impact on the structural deficit within the budget. That's what the former coalition government did: when there were challenges they acted straightaway, and the Australian public knows that. They saw it every week at the fuel bowser; when prices were over $2.20 they went down to under $2. We're now back, depending on the weekend and where you are, somewhere between $1.80 and $2 mark. That's an example of how you can act decisively when crises come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we hear from this government is all excuses. This is the Prime Minister who I'll quote from April last year: 'I'll take responsibility. I'll show leadership. I'll deal with the challenges that are there and there are also opportunities we can seize.' But all we hear from the dispatch box are excuses from this Prime Minister. The Treasurer said on 17 May last year:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we want to show up every day and take responsibility. Not just for the good things, but for the difficult things as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, he's not taking responsibility. They stand up every day and talk about spin. When we look at this budget and at the inflationary challenges, we don't have to take the RBA governor's word for it, because we know he's under pressure: he's looking for his job to be renewed so he's not going to say anything publicly. But look at his actions weeks after the budget: an increase in interest rates. The reason that occurred is because the target of the Treasurer was completely wrong. Let's take it back a step: the inflationary target for this country is two to three per cent. That's the target we're aiming for. Where are we? At six, 6½ or seven per cent—6.8 per cent in April. What should a Treasurer and a Prime Minister try to do? Should they try to deliver a budget which, by their own admission, is at best case neutral? And at worst case, it's expansionary! That's by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister's own admission. No, that's not what he should have been aiming to do. He should have been aiming to bring inflation down to the two to three per cent target band that the RBA governor is trying to get to. So this Treasurer and this Prime Minister failed by their own admission because they had the wrong targets. This is going to cost Australians, and it's going to cost many people in Casey, as interest rates go up, as inflation goes up and as energy goes up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this Prime Minister doesn't care about economics. He didn't know the cash rate. He didn't know the unemployment rate. He has no interest in economics. We have a Treasurer whose priority isn't the economy. This Treasurer's primary priority is, let's be honest, to make sure he can win the support of the backbench on the other side. That's what he's really looking at. He wants to take over from Prime Minister Albanese. That is his priority. He won't make the tough decisions required to bring inflation down. He leaves every Australian struggling every day to find the money they need to pay their bills. Australians know they've been abandoned by this government—they know every time they get an electricity bill or a gas bill, every time the bank sends them that letter saying their interest rates are going up, every time a new inflation target comes out significantly above what they were predicting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that has no plans to bring inflation down. In fact, every time they make an economic decision, they make it worse. They're very happy to claim the credit from the independent Fair Work Commission, but they will then distance themselves from the independent Reserve Bank. You can't have it both ways. You can't claim credit from an independent organisation when you like the results they deliver and not take it when you don't like the results they deliver.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I thank the shadow Treasurer for this matter of public importance because many Australians are struggling with cost-of-living pressures. Inflation takes the most from the people who have the least to give. It hurts people who can't make their budget stretch any further. It hurts first home buyers and people already struggling with high rent. It hurts people already experiencing low wages growth over the last 10 years. I see that in my electorate. I see that at the Parramatta Mission, where the number of people uptaking the food parcels has increased by 187 per cent, where the meals program is up 140 per cent over the last year and where Centrelink referrals have more than tripled. That is the front line of the inflation challenge in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you one person who isn't on the front line of the inflation challenge in Australia, and that's the mover of this motion, the shadow Treasurer. Everybody knows, by this point, that, in the last session of parliament, the shadow Treasurer messed up. He didn't know the price of Vegemite. That's okay. Everybody saw him confuse the annual rate with the monthly rate, which is a pretty big gaffe. What struck me was not that he made that mistake but why he made that mistake. If you were listening carefully, you would have heard the shadow Treasurer say where he got his information on the price of Vegemite. He didn't get it from talking to real people. He didn't get it from Coles. He didn't get it from Woolies. He didn't get it from food banks. He didn't get it from Aldi, although that is a sensible choice. He got it from a UBS Investment Bank report. When it comes to understanding the real pressure on real people, he turns to the merchant banking community—his eyes and ears on the realities of Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I'm not saying he's out of touch, but he does find out the price of Weet-Bix from Westpac; he does check on the price of golden syrup from Goldman Sachs. Some people have their sources, like Deep Throat. He has Deutsche Bank. But it says something about the state of the Liberal Party—that they pretend to care about inflation, that they pretend to care about the cost of living, but that they have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. Could you be any more out of touch than coming into the people's House and talking about the price of groceries as you read from an investment banking report?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that the opposition isn't interested in fixing this problem; they're fixated on blaming the government for it. The words of this MPI make that clear: 'The inflation crisis which this government has caused'. Let's look at that causation. This CPI rising cycle began in 2020, when the level of the CPI was 114.4. From that point, of 114.4, that turning point in the CPI back in 2020, the CPI rose 12 points to 126.1 in the quarter of the federal election in 2022. It went up 12 points. From that point, it's risen six points to 132.6 today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as of this point in the current inflationary cycle, 12 points happened under the Liberals and six have happened while Labor has been in government. Of the 18-point increase in the CPI level, there were 12 under those opposite and just six under us. And you see the math. Why did it go up so much under the Liberals? It went up so much under the Liberals because they delivered the most expansionary budgets in Australia's peacetime history, because of the billions of dollars wasted on JobKeeper, the worst targeted program in Australia's history, subsidising businesses and employees that did not have significant revenue hits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you remember that JobKeeper Treasury analysis that identified them wasting $50 billion? The waste on that program was equivalent to some of the largest programs in Commonwealth government history. Giving JobKeeper money to companies that didn't have a decline in revenue—to Harvey Norman, to private schools, to Qantas, to hundreds of companies whose profit went up—was perhaps the biggest fiscal waste in Australia's history. That is the waste that drove up inflation on their watch. The simple reason is that they were profligate and took their eyes off the macroeconomic ball.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not the only reason inflation went up. There was a war in Ukraine and there were supply chain issues, but, to the extent that government action is part of those reasons, it was their government not ours.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—This will be Australia's 40th bilateral extradition treaty, which reflects the importance the government places on international engagement on matters of serious and transnational crime. Bilateral extradition treaties help ensure that the extradition process is simplified and more effective.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Czech Republic extradition treaty outlines the process for the surrender of an individual from one country to the other for criminal prosecution or to serve a prison sentence, and the treaty ensures the streamlining of cooperation between the two countries and their responses to extradition requests and processing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia and the Czech Republic are like-minded countries with a mutual interest in responding to crime. By working together in this area the two countries will contribute to holding those who've committed crimes accountable, whether through prosecution in a court of law or through serving a prison sentence. Key reasons for the proposed treaty action and the cooperation it enables include the general cost of serious and organised crime for Australia, which was between $24.8 and $60.1 billion in 2020-21. The crimes include the importation of illicit drugs, trafficking and other illicit commodities, and, of course, cybercrime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ratification of this treaty will also contribute to ensuring that individuals who have left Australia will not be able to avoid justice by crossing borders. Equally, Australia will be able to assist other countries in the return and prosecution of people charged with serious crimes. This treaty will strengthen the relationship between Australia and the Czech Republic as partners in law enforcement and will be particularly helpful in areas such as the manufacture and transshipment of synthetic drugs and with respect to serious cybercrime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties held a public hearing, as part of the inquiry into this treaty, which included addressing questions about the grounds for extradition refusal, the number and cost of extradition processes in which Australia is involved, and the importance of such agreements being consistent with Australia's position with respect to both opposing and actively seeking the abolition of the death penalty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all committee members and the deputy chair for their contribution to the inquiry. On the basis of everything I've said, the committee supports the extradition treaty and has recommended that binding treaty action be taken. On behalf of the committee, I commend this report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  by leave—I thank the House for the opportunity to make a brief statement on this report. One of the most important duties this parliament has is to do everything we can to ensure we keep Australians safe. That's exactly what the Treaty on Extradition between Australia and the Czech Republic aims to do. Signed by the former coalition government, this treaty strengthens the law enforcement cooperation relationship between our two countries. We have 39 such treaties with other countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the national interest analysis notes, the key reason for the treaty is the general cost of serious and organised crime: up to $60 billion in 2021. Specifically, our engagement with the Czech Republic includes efforts to combat the manufacture and shipment of synthetic drugs as well as serious cybercrime. At the centre of this treaty action is the intention to create a comprehensive framework between Australia and the Czech Republic that will facilitate the surrender of a person from one country to the other country for the purposes of criminal prosecution or the imposition or service of a criminal sentence. The last thing our law enforcement authorities need when wanting to stop crime or take drugs off our streets is an uncertain process with no guarantee of an outcome. This treaty will help minimise that uncertainty. Importantly, it includes provisions for urgent cases, where a requesting country can apply for the provisional arrest of a person whose extradition will be requested at a later stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank the chair, the committee and those who help us in the secretariat. I commend the report to the House and thank the committee for its recommendation that binding treaty action be taken.</span>

The committee acknowledges that appropriation bills may present difficulties, given their high-level nature; however, the committee considers that the allocation of funds through these bills is susceptible to a human rights assessment directed at broader questions of compatibility. As such, the committee is seeking further information from the Minister for Finance about the compatibility of these bills with human rights.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also concluded its consideration of the Family Law (Bilateral Arrangements—Intercountry Adoption) Regulations. These regulations declare the Republic of Korea and Taiwan as prescribed overseas jurisdictions for the purposes of bilateral arrangements relating to intercountry adoptions. Intercountry adoptions may separate families and involve placing a child in care outside their country of origin. As such, there may be a risk that the rights of the child and right to protection of the family are limited if the adoption does not comply with international human rights law. However, based on the advice of the Minister for Social Services, the committee considers that the country program review process, which found the intercountry adoption programs in the Republic of Korea and Taiwan to be compliant with the relevant international law, as well as the Commonwealth-state agreement to be important safeguards ensuring that these intercountry adoptions do comply with international human rights law. The committee has recommended that the statement of compatibility be updated to reflect the information provided by the minister and otherwise considers its concerns have been addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the committee has concluded its consideration of the Migration (regional processing country—Republic of Nauru) designation, which redesignates Nauru as a regional processing country for 10 years. The committee notes that providing for the removal of unauthorised maritime arrivals from Australia and Nauru engages and limits several human rights. The committee has raised concerns about offshore processing on numerous occasions and considers that redesignating Nauru as a regional processing country enlivens those same concerns. In particular, the committee considers that there is a risk that this instrument is not consistent with Australia's absolute nonrefoulement obligations and the prohibition against torture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee considers that the remedies available to people subject to removal do not meet the threshold required by the right to an effective remedy. The committee does note that, while no children have been sent to Nauru for years, as a matter of law it is still possible for children to be removed to Nauru in the future, and therefore considers it is not clear that the processes for transfer and the services to children upon transfer would adequately protect their rights. The committee also notes that applying this measure only to persons who arrive by sea has a disproportionate impact on the basis of national origin. There is a risk that this breaches the right to equality and nondiscrimination. The committee draws these concerns to the attention of the minister and the parliament. With these comments, I commend the committee's scrutiny report 6 of 2023 to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence, Assistant Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Assistant Minister for the Republic</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  In continuation, projects will reflect the knowledge and connection to country of our First Nations peoples, utilising their skills and knowledge for nature-positive events in the future. I mentioned earlier the great work that's going on in my electorate at Botany Bay in a partnership between the University of New South Wales and the Gamay Rangers, the Indigenous rangers group, for seagrass restoration. That's a classic example of a nature-positive project in a partnership between the university and Indigenous rangers. These will operate side by side with the carbon market, with a shared regulator, and the market will encourage carbon farming projects that also deliver biodiversity developments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The alignment will result in administrative efficiencies and, more importantly, a clear and accurate oversight of claims in both markets. Buyers can have faith in the market thanks to the integrity measures that the government is putting in place with this bill, such as an independent expert committee ensuring projects deliver high-quality, nature-positive outcomes. This approach will guarantee that biodiversity certificates reflect genuine environmental improvement. The regulator will enforce, monitor, report and provide notification requirements for project activities and environmental outcomes, and it will exercise its powers to ensure compliance with those rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also committed to restoring public accountability and trust through our nature-positive plan. The plan ensures transparency, with comprehensive project and certificate information available to the public. Regulator information updates will also come from the regulator, and the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water will actively release relevant data. We're also working hand in hand with the ACCC and ASIC to prevent the so-called greenwashing of certificates in the nature repair market. The statements about certificates should accurately reflect the projects and the investments that they represent. We value consultation and engagement as we navigate our environmental reform agenda. We're not just listening but actively incorporating feedback on the market's design and operation to ensure that integrity into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're engaging in a co-design approach, with First Nations Australians helping to develop priority methods and proper incorporation of traditional knowledge and management practices. That's a key feature of the seagrass restoration project that's occurring in Botany Bay. The scientists at UNSW have been sitting down and taking in the traditional knowledge and the cultural knowledge of those involved, with the Gamay Rangers and those that have the traditional knowledge because of their connection to country. Professor Adriana Verges, the UNSW scientist that's leading this project, spoke to me and outlined how in the past there had always been a scientific approach to projects such as this, but it ignored the cultural and historical connection that First Nations Australians have with the natural ecology around Australia. But this time they were taking a different approach and listening to and consulting with First Nations Australians from the La Perouse Aboriginal community about their cultural knowledge and traditional practices, and how important that is for ecology as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will mandate public consultation on methods and the instrument for measuring and assessing biodiversity. The proposed legislation establishes the Nature Repair Market Committee to advise the minister following that public consultation. The committee will include five to six experts with extensive experience and standing in areas like agriculture, science, environmental markets, land management, economics or Indigenous knowledge. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature Positive Plan </span>outlines a fresh approach to biodiversity offsets, and we will legislate to make offsets the last resort. The government is also designing and consulting on a new national standard for matters of national environmental significance and environmental offsets, and the standards will provide certainty in the use of biodiversity offsets under Commonwealth laws, focusing on the protection and restoration of ecosystems. Projects under the nature repair scheme won't be used as offsets unless they meet new standards. The nature repair market will provide a supply of projects certified through purpose designed offset methods. The register will provide comprehensive public information on these projects and the biodiversity that they are protecting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will create a new market for investing in nature-positive outcomes. It will support Australia's international commitments to protect and repair ecosystems and reverse species decline and extinction. Unfortunately, Australia has the unenviable record of the largest rate of mammal extinctions in the world, and that is something that this government is deeply keen to arrest and to change. We're striving to protect and improve that rate and that record, and in doing so protect not only endangered species but all species for the future as well. We're dedicated to striving to improve our natural environment for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is simplifying the investment process for businesses, organisations and individuals that are interested in conservation projects across the country. We're backing those landholders that know conservation and ecology best, farmers and, of course, First Nations communities, with specific environmental projects such as the replanting of crucial koala habitats, the restoration of damaged riverbeds, the removal of invasive species and projects such as the one that I mentioned in my electorate—the seagrass restoration project in Botany Bay. By establishing an integral and transparent nature repair market, we will ensure that businesses and philanthropists can confidently invest in nature into the future. They will have the ability to purchase quality, well-regulated nature repair certificates and ensure that their investments in protection and restoration yield significant yet lasting environmental benefits. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  These two bills, the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and the Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023, establish a legislative framework for what I think initially will be a voluntary national market for new so-called biodiversity certificates. This sounds quite harmless and beneficial, but there are a lot of problems with this scheme which I will just outline for people in the House and listening around Australia. This market, an artificial construct, would enable biodiversity certificates and enable project proponents to start up a biodiversity project on any type of land tenure, including aquatic and coastal environments. This legislation is only the beginning of it. It is just the primary legislation, but all the details will subsequently follow in legislative instruments that won't have as much scrutiny. The bills also amend part of the Clean Energy Regulator Act 2011 and the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People have said this will ignite a green Wall Street. People, even people in the Greens, have mentioned that the logic and the science behind it is a bit spurious, and it will allow people to greenwash projects that have huge environmental footprints. It's a piecemeal response to a perceived ill. It will lead to a lot of industries chasing yet more certificates to allow them to continue their businesses. We already have Australian carbon credit units and we have safeguard mechanism credits, and to this we can add biodiversity certificates. This demand by industry for these certificates is having adverse consequences and misappropriating the use of good agricultural land. It's putting up the price of land as people with much bigger chequebooks than farmers will be dedicating large and small swathes of good agricultural land to these passive schemes, and we will have much less agriculture as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few other really important issues. These biodiversity certificates, once created, can be purchased, transferred, claimed, used and publicly traded. It creates a personal property, a tradable personal property, which can be separated from the owner of the land on which the project is put. The proponent of the biodiversity doesn't necessarily have to be the title owner of the land. It provides a requirement to obtain consent; if there is land that is subject to native title, there will be a requirement for the proponent and the owner of the land to obtain consent from native title holders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the face of it, that sounds good, but in many states even Torrens title has native title claims or cultural rights claimed over it. In Queensland, it's not just Crown land but grazing homestead perpetual leases; a lot of agricultural grazing and productive land is held under that sort of tenure. It will be able to be applied on onshore waters, in lakes and rivers, and in offshore waters, in the marine and coastal environment. I can understand why they would have to approve for areas of native title exclusive use, because it's theirs exclusively. But because native title claims can be put just about anywhere, depending on what state you are in, and over vastly more areas, it basically sets up a requirement for everyone to go and get approval.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this costs money. It's not just a visit and, 'Yes, this will be great.' There is always money changing hands. That is where I have great problems with this, because the certificate then becomes a very tradable instrument which doesn't necessarily deliver any coherent, broad strategy. It will cherry-pick bits and pieces, not just of those lands that I mentioned but all private lands—Crown lands. And, over time, the requirement under the safeguard mechanism for industry to offset all their existentially required industrial processes for Australia and the modern industrial world to exist means Australia will be dotted with all these biodiversity certificates on top of Australian Carbon Credit Unit lands, and Safeguard Mechanism Credits lands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this proposed scheme, the certificates can be generated as class A for 25 years, or up to 100 years. But when you read the detail, and when we do see the legislative instruments—which will come at some time in the next year or two—the secretary could purchase these or he could have auctions for them. He could deem, if he thinks it's needed, to change a 25-year commitment to a 100-year commitment. So anyone who is thinking that this is voluntary, should know that it might end up with their land being tied up for anything from 25 to 100 years. Even when they onsell it, that covenant on the property will last.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These could be auctioned off by Crown landholders and purchased or deposited with the regulator, who could then onsell them. It's really a question of there being a lot of market—in fact, all market. I can see why people love these schemes, because it's just like trading tulips: there's nothing tangible. We're trying to put strict compliance and regulation into it but, as one ecologist, Dr Yung En Chee, a quantitative ecologist at the University of Melbourne, said that the nature repair market:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… is a policy based on  lawed premises, non-existent evidence of effectiveness and is a poor use of public resources relative to alternative policies …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there is a threat to biodiversity in this country, but it would be much better if we were doing things to address the horrifying rates for Australian marsupials, invertebrates and large and small animals under threat from feral pests. Many of us here have sat on environment committees looking into the threat of cane toads or feral cats, that lead to more extinguishments of birds, in particular, and small mammals than the latest bushfires. And they do that every year, but there's nothing that I've seen coming out after the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the environment report</span> about us addressing that. There are millions of feral pigs and dogs, and, I hasten to say, hundreds of thousands of camels in Australia destroying a lot of habitat. These are of far, far greater importance to control rather than tying up someone's property, leading to something like a Ponzi scheme where certificates are traded around the country with Indigenous landholders clipping the ticket on the way through. It's really something that's very concerning. We've always got to look at the details and the consequences of these schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the main thing is that there's increasing pressure on a lot of our big industries to get these certificates in some shape or form. They're like the indulgences that brought about the Reformation in the 1500s: you got plenary absolution if you paid money and offset some of the sin that you were deemed to have created. A lot of these processes that happen in the industrial world are existential for the modern world to happen. Sure, we have to try to minimise it, but the biggest thing in this country to offset all the carbon going up into the atmosphere is to put low-carbon energy systems in place. But the lowest, safest, cheapest and most rapidly expanding form of energy is banned in this country. We are banning the cleanest and the safest form of energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at the plans the states have in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. These 41 renewable energy zones around the country are going to span ridges, vast tracts of land, like Alan Finkel said, 'as far as the eye can see' solar panels and 40 giant wind turbines every month—millions and millions of solar panels that only last 15 years or so before they have to be destroyed. They will be destroying vast tracts of habitat. The Hume Link will consume about 45,000 hectares of habitat that will be destroyed, remnant vegetation. There's the windfarm at Walcha where there are 550 big towers. It's like an industrial wind park. It will destroy that valley. All the marsupials and animals that live on those ridges won't go anywhere when there's DC current and whirring and infrasound all over the place. They become wastelands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're planning on putting in pumped hydro schemes in Queensland, like in New South Wales. There are three in New South Wales, at least. There are a couple of huge pumped hydro schemes in Borumba, in the Pioneer-Burdekin. Run-of-river hydro, where the river still flows—if you're going to lock up water and do it so that you can use it whenever the price goes up, when the wind and the sun aren't generating, that's a bad use of resources. It's unnecessarily destroying a lot of nature. The footprint of a nuclear power plant is minuscule compared to the millions of acres that the perpetual building of renewable energy will release on the Australian landscape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this is another scheme that will make the bankers and the traders and all those people who are making money out of flipping certificates and trading them very pleased. I'm getting into a lather thinking about it. But I don't think there's going to be much. Even Sarah Hanson-Young thinks people are deluding themselves. She is a pretty extreme Greens senator, but, for once, she's actually making a point. These are indulgences. It is like the tulip mania. People think you can make money out of something and pay much more than the intrinsic value of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are really going to get serious about repairing nature, let's control all our feral pests and animals; let's abandon this reckless destruction of sensitive agriculture and horticultural landscapes with the 28,000 kilometres of poles and wires that aren't necessary. We could just be using our existing grid if we replaced our coal plants with clean nuclear power reactors, which have a very low environmental footprint. So, buyer beware! If I was an owner of land, I wouldn't be signing up for this. A lot of people I know who have had vast tracts of land that have been hard to work but have been very productive see this as money for jam. But once it's there, everyone will be feeding off it. You will be encumbered and that property will be encumbered for up to 100 years. It's voluntary at the moment, but the gods of environmentalism that deem these things the solution to a problem will be urging them to become mandatory.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  I'm very glad to speak in support of the Nature Repair Market Bill and the Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill. They deliver a key feature of the Albanese government's commitment to take a very different approach to Australia's environmental condition and biodiversity. We are not going to sit idle while Australia's environment continues on a trajectory of deterioration, especially when we know that risks and threats are increasing in the form of climate change, biosecurity impacts and natural disasters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Creating a nature repair market is just one part of a set of coordinated measures being taken by the Albanese government, led by the Minister for the Environment and Water. The member for Lyne, who just spoke, gave the impression that this is the only thing that we're doing, and that's far from the truth. We need to do lots of things, and this is one of them. The fact that we're doing anything stands in stark contrast to those opposite. The member for Lyne and I were members of the environment and energy committee, and some of the things he was just talking about before in terms of controlling feral animals are quite laudable, but what did the previous government do when he was a part of it for nine or 10 years? Absolutely nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature repair market is a world first. It will, in essence, connect those who rightly and sensibly want to invest in nature repair with those who can do the work on the ground, and that's a good thing. We need to repair and restore our environment and biodiversity in addition to protecting our environment and biodiversity. There is another thing about the member for Lyne's contribution which was odd. I don't know if he noticed, but only recently, in 2021, while he was in government, the member for Maranoa, who was the minister for agriculture at that stage, introduced the Agriculture Biodiversity Stewardship Package. It was essentially a pilot form of what we are doing. It was a means by which farmers could get credit for work they were doing, in addition to fixing carbon, to improve biodiversity. At the time, they described the pilot as a world first. This nature repair market, which we will actually deliver, is clearly a world first, but it was something that the previous government and the member for Maranoa, as the minister for agriculture at the time, were spruiking to anyone and everyone who would listen to it. I'm not sure whether the member for Lyne was paying attention in those government meetings, but it's something that I expect that those opposite will endorse, because it's a bigger and better form of something that they were thinking about doing but, as with so many things, never got around to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Minister for the Environment and Water has explained, this bill puts the framework in place to create a nature repair market. It puts in place the register, the rules and the regulator so that landholders who undertake restoration and repair will be able to receive a tradeable certificate that represents that environmental value. The certificates will be listed and traceable through the public register and will be issued and overseen by the Clean Energy Regulator. It is true that we need to go and create this market with care, and we need to make sure that those who undertake environmental repair and restoration and biodiversity improvement do so in a way that is rigorously overseen, measured and tracked. There is always the potential in any market for things to be done in a way that doesn't have the integrity that we would all expect. That's why the Clean Energy Regulator, as an independent statutory authority, will be given the task of ensuring that that kind of integrity and confidence exists in this market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the member for Lyne talked about the market as being an artificial construct. Every market is an artificial construct. The problem with our market and our economy is that they have taken certain forms of harm and the costs related to that harm, whether it's climate change or impacts to the environment and biodiversity, and just let them fall on the common wealth, really. A tragedy of the commons is how it's described, where you basically have all kinds of economic activity that have harmful impacts and costs associated with those harmful impacts but they're not actually built into the market, so all of the people producing carbon and profiting from the production that involves carbon emissions never actually incorporate the cost of those emissions into their economic process. It's the fact that all markets, which we, as human beings, create, don't work very well that causes a lot of these problems, and they're ultimately unsustainable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other phrase that I found a bit interesting from the member for Lyne is that he described this as a piecemeal response to a perceived ill. Is anyone suggesting that the savage and profound environmental decline the world over but also in Australia—the biodiversity decline in Australia in particular—is a perceived ill? That's just bizarre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this new framework is a world first. It will work with a range of other measures to begin the considerable work required to protect, repair and restore Australia's environment on land and at sea, and we cannot wait another day for that work to begin. It is a genuinely desperate imperative. Our environment is not in good shape. Our environment has been hammered, chiefly because of us, chiefly because we've lived in a way that is unsustainable. The two vectors of harm have been destruction of habitat and the impact of invasive species. To that we have added, in recent decades, climate change, which, sadly, in lots of areas has now become the greatest threat and is exacerbating the already severe impacts of habitat destruction and invasive species.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government knew all about that. They knew all about the big picture, they knew all about the vectors of harm and they didn't do anything about them. They knew because they commissioned the Samuel report and they knew it because they received, but hid, the most recent <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment</span> report. The Samuel review put all of this pretty cleanly. This is a review that the previous government commissioned, that they received and that you'd think they might have read. This is what Graeme Samuel said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's natural environment and iconic places are in an overall state of decline and are under increasing threat. The environment is not sufficiently resilient to withstand current, emerging or future threats, including climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The EPBC Act is out dated and requires fundamental reform. It does not enable the Commonwealth to effectively fulfil its environmental management responsibilities to protect nationally important matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the former government do with that review that they commissioned? Nothing, zero—literally nothing. There were a few elements of the report which were pretty clear and sensible: reform the EPBC, make sure that there are strong and effective national standards and put in place an independent environmental protection agency. No, they weren't going to have any of that. In fact, they made it clear from the very outset that they would never introduce an independent environmental protection agency. That is another of the reforms that the Albanese Labor government is getting on with, and there is funding of $120 million in the budget for precisely that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government comprehensively ignored the Samuel review when it said to them quite plainly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To shy away from the fundamental reforms recommended by this Review is to accept the continued decline of our iconic places and the extinction of our most threatened plants, animals and ecosystems. This is unacceptable. A firm commitment to change from all stakeholders is needed to enable future generations to enjoy and benefit from Australia's unique environment and heritage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given the current state of Australia's environment, broad restoration is required to address past loss, build resilience and reverse the current trajectory of environmental decline. Restoration is necessary to enable Australia to accommodate future development in a sustainable way. The scale of the task ahead is significant and is too large for governments to try to solve alone. To support greater collaboration between governments and the private sector, new mechanisms are needed to leverage the scale of investment that will be needed for decades to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills and the reforms they create are exactly the kinds of things that Samuel was calling for; exactly the prescription that he gave to the former government when he called for new mechanisms to leverage the scale of investment. That's what this bill will do, among all the other measures that have been led by the Minister for the Environment and Water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, we know the scale of the crisis we are dealing with. The government received the latest <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment</span> report. It went to the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party as the responsible minister at the time. Like so many reports in her portfolio area, it went straight to the bottom of the drawer. The <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment</span> report—with its damning indictment of the deteriorated condition of Australia's terrestrial and marine ecosystems and its damning indictment of the fragility of our biodiversity, particularly in the form of many, many endangered species that exist on the brink—went straight to the bottom drawer. That was not put in the public domain, because the previous government weren't prepared to do anything and didn't want the opprobrium, didn't want to bear the responsibility, for their inaction. But we've got the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment</span> report because, of course, with a change of government those things have to come out of the bottom drawer and into the light.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've lost more mammal species than any other continent in the last two centuries. We've got one of the highest rates of species decline among countries in the OECD. We've got more than 1,900 Australian species and ecological communities that are threatened or at risk of extinction. Almost half of Australia's major vegetation types have lost at least 20 per cent of their original extent, and one, which is the casuarina forests and woodlands, has lost more than 40 per cent of its original extent.</span>

In the Murray-Darling Basin, which is home to 16 internationally significant Ramsar wetlands, 35 endangered species and 98 species of waterbirds, rivers and catchments are mostly in poor condition. Native fish populations in the Murray-Darling Basin have declined by more than 90 per cent in the past 150 years. The member for Lyne described this as a perceived ill. Ninety per cent of the native fish populations in the Murray-Darling Basin have gone in the last 150 years, thanks to us—and that's a 'perceived ill'! We know coral reef ecosystems are in poor condition. We had unprecedented marine heatwaves in 2016, 2017 and 2020, the first-ever consecutive years of coral bleaching.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the reality of our environment, and that's the reason for the desperate urgency of the task of greater environmental protection, repair and restoration. We cannot turn away from that harm. We cannot ignore that trajectory of decline. That is what we have done, and we've borne the results. Now we're seeing species of marine birds and fish where you get 50 per cent of them with microplastic in their gut, because we've done nothing about marine plastic pollution. The previous government did nothing about plastic pollution.</span>

It's why the minister for environment wasted no time in getting started on work nationally and being proactive and collaborative internationally. We've made a commitment to protect 30 per cent of our land and sea by 2030. We've joined the High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution.

                    </a>  Thank you—the minister announced that the Macquarie Island Marine Park is set to triple in size. That's 385,000 additional square kilometres of Australia's oceans under higher protection, an area larger than Germany, that will be completely protected from fishing, mining and other extractive activities. This makes not just a significant contribution within the oceans for which we are responsible but a globally significant contribution to the health and resilience of our oceans. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It picks up and continues the work that Labor undertook when last in government to create a national network of marine protected areas. We did that when we were last in government, and we're barely 12 months into the job and we're getting on with that again. We've added a remarkable and very significant additional amount of ocean protection. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent budget includes funding to create an EPA, $262 million to support Commonwealth national parks, $163 million to the brilliant Australian Institute of Marine Science to continue their world-leading scientific marine research, and nearly $120 million to community groups, NGOs and local governments and First Nations groups to clean up and restore local urban rivers and waterways. All of those things, along with these bills creating a nature repair market, are part of a massive night-and-day, black-and-white change between the awful neglect and wilful blindness of the previous government, when it came to our environment, and the approach that the Albanese Labor government is taking under the leadership of the Minister for Environment and Water. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've outlined, the Albanese government as a whole and the Minister for Environment and Water have wasted no time, because there is no time to waste. Creating a nature repair market is one measure that answers what experts like Graeme Samuel have called for—new and innovative ways of delivering repair and restoration while, at the same time, we make new, rigorous, urgent and, in many cases, uncompromising efforts to protect Australia's environment and remarkable but endangered biodiversity. That's what has to be done. That's what this government is getting on with and doing. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  Indi is home to some of the most beautiful natural landscapes in Australia—indeed, in the world. We are rich with parks, wetlands, rivers, grasslands, abundant fields, fauna and flora, from the grass-tree orchards in the Warby Ranges to the native orchids in the Chiltern-Mount Pilot National Park. Our high rainfall also means that we're home to fertile farmland producing beef, dairy, wool, wine, cherries, berries, apples and more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, though, like much of Australia, Indi's unique flora and fauna are under threat. Land clearing for farming and timber supply means that plants and animals across Indi are threatened with extinction. Some of our most endangered species include the Macquarie perch, the swift parrot, the mountain pygmy possum and the Swainson-pea. A changing climate presents one of the biggest threats to our wildlife. Of Australia's 1,800 threatened species, 327 were severely impacted by the Black Summer bushfires, including the koala, the greater glider and the regent honeyeater. Losing just one species forever has a ripple effect. It impacts the water we drink, the pollination of our crops and the existence of other native species. The regent honeyeater, for example, pollinates iconic eucalyptus trees. If we lose it, then we're at risk of losing food and habitat for many other native animals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 presents a significant opportunity to restore, repair and protect Indi's farmland, bushland, public land and parks, and, in turn, protects our native species. I support this bill's intentions but, to ensure its success, we must support those navigating this new complex biodiversity market. This is key to ensuring a robust and trusted framework. The bill aims to repair nature by creating a framework for a national market in biodiversity certificates. This means that organisations and businesses, including farms, can undertake projects on land that protect or enhance biodiversity. If someone wants to remove an invasive pest, repair a riverbank or replant a species habitat, they can apply to the Clean Energy Regulator for a unique biodiversity certificate that would then be sold on the market to government, businesses or philanthropists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is one part of fulfilling the government's important commitment under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework to halt and reverse biodiversity loss and to protect 30 per cent of land, inland waters and ocean by 2030. Farmers are going to play a key role in this new market. Indeed, this bill is closely modelled on the former government's Agriculture Biodiversity Stewardship Market Bill, where only farmers would participate in a biodiversity credit scheme. For this bill to work, farmers must be educated and supported so they can fully participate in the market. That's because farmers already engage in nature repair. JP Murphy, who runs a beef farm near Lurg in my electorate of Indi, has reintroduced native trees on his property to improve the canopy and understorey. Many other farmers are like JP Murphy. He speaks about how this kind of nature repair activity brings back other species, like bird life and wombats, in abundance to create resilient and self-replenishing ecosystems that benefit the landscape and, therefore, his farming business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">JP wants any participation in a biodiversity credit market to ensure co-benefits for the environment and for business. A survey of 600 farmers by Farmers for Climate Action found that 94 per cent of respondents, just like JP, want to change their practices if it would benefit both themselves and the environment. But 70 per cent of these respondents had not been involved in any kind of educational extension program to help them do this. Government funded extension programs have been used historically to help farmers navigate changing times. But in recent times the government has clearly failed to provide this kind of support. We can, and must, change this, and the government's Climate-Smart Agriculture program is the beginning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was overjoyed that this budget included support for a network of sustainable agricultural facilitators. These facilitators will provide extension services to farmers to do exactly what we need: to build their knowledge of climate-smart practices and to understand the emerging carbon and biodiversity markets to inform future investment decisions. This replicates directly my policy that I took to the last election, a policy about which farmers in my electorate, farmers just like JP Murphy, told me, 'This is what we needed to bridge the knowledge gap.' I heard from them that a network of neutral and trusted advisers on sustainable practices, technologies and emerging markets was exactly the kind of information they needed. What a great idea coming from the farmers!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I took this idea to Canberra and, on the way, gained the support of the National Farmers Federation, Farmers for Climate Action and many others. I've used every tool available to me to show government that this is part of the solution, a key one: speeches, motions and a budget submission to Treasury back in January. I've had many conversations with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and I want to thank him very much for working with me so constructively to listen to farmers and deliver on this policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an Independent regional member of parliament, I listened to the farmers in my community saying they wanted to be more sustainable, to understand about carbon and biodiversity markets—to understand what they mean for them and to understand how they can improve the productivity of their farming enterprises to be more profitable and to help the environment. This is what happens when you listen to the people in your community and take evidence based solutions—solutions from the ground up—to government. I'm really proud of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all of those who fought alongside me to see this policy through, including the farmers in Indi and the agricultural community around the nation more broadly. I'll now watch very closely how the government consults with the agricultural sector and these organisations—organisations like Landcare—to ensure the funding that's been committed delivers real benefits to farmers' productivity and profitability and to the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this bill but I also hear concerns from local and national environmental groups, including the Environmental Defenders Office and the Landcare groups in my electorate. I hear concerns about whether the new nature repair market will be used to offset biodiversity loss from proposed developments and projects. Experts have found that the practice of offsetting biodiversity loss does not actually benefit our environment. The Samuel review found that current offset policies actually contribute to environmental decline rather than to active restoration. As the Beechworth Landcare group described to me, offsetting biodiversity loss is basically permitting harm in one area based on doing good work somewhere else. Ultimately, though, the harm still happens. I see this in my own electorate. The nearest existing offset location for a recent vegetation clearing application in Wangaratta was in the Baw Baw shire, over 300 kilometres away. If the intention is for an offset to benefit the local ecosystem, it's hard to see how it was achieved in this instance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government admit biodiversity offsets could be one source of demand for credits under a nature repair market, and they've committed to a future review of environmental laws that deals with offsets, a review which I very much welcome. But right now it's very unclear whether biodiversity certificates as described under the bill can be used to offset biodiversity loss, and many of my colleagues here on the crossbench share this concern. I urge the government to clarify this and clarify it very soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to see this nature repair market and the biodiversity credits it issues operate with integrity. We can't afford to lose trust in a system that is so critical to protecting our precious biodiversity. I'm pleased that the government has already implemented recommendations to improve the bill, such as ensuring the Nature Repair Market Committee always has a biodiversity expert to advise the minister on what methodologies can be used for projects, but there's still room for improvement. The government must go a lot further than this on this bill to actually protect our declining biodiversity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've listened to the concerns of groups like the Places You Love Alliance, who are continuing to advocate for substantial government investment in biodiversity protection. It's insufficient to rely on private investment through a nature repair market alone. This government must continue to implement the recommendations of the Samuel review, which, sadly, highlighted the deteriorating state of Australia's biodiversity and the failure of Australia's national environmental laws. We need new, legally binding, outcomes focused national environmental standards, and we need them urgently. A strong, independent and adequately funded national environment protection agency is crucial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill could also be strengthened by requiring projects to align with natural resource management plans. These plans are developed by catchment management authorities, like the North East Catchment Management Authority in my electorate, alongside community groups and First Nations people. They articulate regional communities' priorities for land management, including repairing nature. Ensuring that projects under the bill align with these plans will build a stronger social licence to operate, remove potential perverse outcomes and build opportunities to leverage multiple community benefits. Government can, and must, do more to protect our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Until they do, we are lucky to have dedicated organisations and individuals that are working hard, often as volunteers, to protect our native wildlife and restore our environments. For over 30 years, Wangaratta Landcare and Sustainability have been repairing native vegetation. The team manage and protect Kaluna Park, an award-winning rehabilitation site that was once a weed-infested wilderness area. Through careful removal of invasive trees, replanting native trees and regular weeding, this site, which is so close to the Wangaratta CBD, has been successfully restored. It is a total joy. Kaluna Park is particularly precious because it's home to culturally significant signal trees, birthing trees and canoe trees of the Bangerang people. It is truly a treasure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The North East Catchment Management Authority, or NECMA, brings together partners from across the region to identify and respond to the challenges that cannot be solved by one organisation or one stakeholder alone. For five years, they've worked on the Bush for Birds program to restore habitat for the threatened regent honeyeater and swift parrot. NECMA has worked closely with Trust for Nature, local Indigenous groups, local government, Parks Victoria, Landcare and private landholders to revegetate, remove weeds and control pests across thousands of hectares to improve habitat for these beautiful bird species. The government's budget commitment to the Nature Heritage Trust will also resource NECMA and other natural resource management organisations like the Goulburn Broken Catchment Management Authority in my electorate so that they can continue this incredibly important work delivering climate smart, sustainable agricultural actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Community collaboration has seen the reintroduction of the Mountain Swainson-pea, which I mentioned earlier. It was once found across the state, but grazing, land clearing and fertiliser had seen its population decline so drastically that in 2012 it disappeared entirely in Victoria. However, a Victorian government program, in collaboration with NECMA, Landcare and private landholders, has cultivated seeds and planted hundreds of these in the Chiltern-Mount Pilot National Park. Through time and dedication, this program has given the formerly extinct native plant a second chance at life. I want to recognise Neville Bartlett, Eileen Collins and all the members of the Friends of Chiltern Mount-Pilot National Park for their dedicated efforts towards rejuvenating the wild pea and many other species.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to support our local groups and farmers to protect and rejuvenate the flora and fauna we love so much. A nature repair market is one part of the solution. The government's budget commitments to fund climate smart agricultural projects, replicating that extension officer policy of mine that I talked about, is a fantastic start to bringing it all together. Bringing together government, farmers and Landcare groups is the right approach to protecting and repairing our treasured natural landscapes and species, like the Mountain Swainson-pea in Victoria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During this term of parliament, we need to see a whole lot more action from this government to follow through on the goals which we all see and which we want to achieve. Our biodiversity is crucial. It's precious, because once it's gone, it is gone forever.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  I rise to speak in strong support of the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023. It is an important bill that enables the protection and restoration of our valuable natural assets. Through this bill, the Albanese Labor government will make it easier for people to invest in activities that help repair nature. It is crucial that we take these measures to ensure that we leave nature in a better condition for our future generations. We are a government that values and protects our environment. I am a nature lover, like many in this place and like many people in my electorate of Pearce in Western Australia. There is nothing better for our health and our souls than being surrounded by natural landscapes. It is calming and rejuvenating. As an ambassador for the WA Parks Foundation, I promote and raise awareness of our natural environments, particularly our national parks. Pearce has many beautiful bushland areas and more than 30 kilometres of stunning coastline. We have the beautiful Yanchep National Park and the Yellagonga Regional Park, and many others that I know are highly valued by our large and fast-growing community. The Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 has many merits. It is a framework to support landholders in their efforts to protect and restore nature. The bill will help support landholders, including farmers and First Nations communities, to do things such as plant native species and repair damaged riverbeds. Establishing the nature repair market will also support landholders to remove invasive species, which are a real problem in some of our natural areas. The nature repair market is part of the Albanese Labor government's delivery of the Nature Positive Plan, and, through this, we make it easier for businesses and philanthropists to invest in these areas. The nature repair market will make it simpler for individuals, businesses, organisations and governments to invest in projects that protect and repair nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has made a commitment to protect 30 per cent of Australia's land and seas by 2030. The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity has adopted the same goals across the world. These targets of protecting 30 per cent reinforce the findings of the 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment </span>report—a report that speaks of environmental degradation, loss and inaction. We absolutely need significant investment in conservation and restoration for a nature-positive future. Professor Graeme Samuel AC reviewed the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. His findings highlighted the need for investment. Business and private sector investment can contribute to reversing environmental decline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am encouraged by the fact that conservation groups, private companies, farmers and landholders are increasingly looking for ways that they can achieve positive outcomes for nature. I see this in my electorate, with groups such as the Friends of Yellagonga Regional Park, who recently celebrated their 30th anniversary, and the Quinns Rocks Environmental Group. These are committed volunteers who understand the value of nature and the importance of what they do so very willingly. A report prepared independently estimates that the market for biodiversity in Australia could unlock a staggering $137 billion in financial flows by 2050. As a government, we are responding to that demand. What is important to note is that the nature repair market will be based on science, and it will enable Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders to promote their unique knowledge on their own terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Establishing the market legislation will ensure its ongoing integrity. This will also encourage investment in nature and drive environmental improvements across Australia. The bill will enable the Clean Energy Regulator, an independent statutory authority with significant experience in regulating environmental markets, to issue Australian landholders with tradeable biodiversity certificates. These certificates can then be sold to individuals, businesses, organisations and government. Importantly, the market will be inclusive, and all landholders, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, conservation groups and farmers, can participate. Potential projects will deliver long-term nature-positive outcomes through activities such as pest control, weeding and planting native species. These projects can be undertaken on land or water. This includes lakes and rivers, as well as marine and coastal environments. This bill is about doing better by our natural assets. Open participation and extensive opportunities for project locations will also support regional Australia through jobs and nature-positive economic activity. This will be fantastic for regional areas around the country when you also consider the employment potential that it will create. The nature repair market will enable participation and create employment and economic opportunities for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. It will promote and enable free, prior and informed consent for projects on their land or waters, and there will be opportunities to design projects that reflect the knowledge and connection to country of our First Nations people. We will be able to utilise their skills, knowledge and wisdom for a nature-positive future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The market will operate in parallel with the carbon market, with the same regulator. This alignment will encourage carbon-farming projects that also deliver benefits for biodiversity—a win-win. By establishing it in this manner, there will be administrative efficiencies in this approach and, more importantly, clear and accurate oversight of claims made in both markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government acknowledges the recent review of carbon crediting led by Professor Ian Chubb. Lessons learnt from the carbon market have informed the bill and will continue to be reflected upon as environmental markets develop. The bill provides for biodiversity certificates to have integrity and represent an actual environmental improvement. Buyers can then invest in the market with confidence. There will be a key integrity measure too and an independent expert committee that will hold responsibility for ensuring projects deliver high-quality, nature-positive outcomes. These will be underpinned by a consistent approach to the measurement, assessment and verification of biodiversity. The integrity of the environmental outcomes is also enabled through assurance and compliance requirements, using monitoring, reporting and notification on the delivery of project activities and progress on the environmental outcomes. The regulator will have both monitoring and enforcement powers to ensure that projects are conducted in accordance with the rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature Positive Plan</span> reflects the Albanese Labor government's commitment to restoring public accountability and trust. A core element of the scheme will be transparency, and that is vitally important. A public register will outline in a comprehensive manner information about projects and certificates so that anyone can access details. Additional information will be regularly published by the regulator, and relevant data will be released by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. This is part of ensuring the transparency I spoke of and will enable parliament and the public to monitor the scheme and provide an opportunity for citizen oversight. Additionally, it will support certainty and value to the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The department is committed to working with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to ensure that certificates issued in the nature repair market are not the object of what's known as greenwashing. It is crucial that statements made about certificates accurately reflect the projects and investment that they represent. It is also important that projects in the carbon and biodiversity markets are not affected by misleading claims, and we seek to ensure that this does not happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is committed to listening to consultation and engagement under our environmental reform agenda. We have listened and will continue to listen to feedback on the design and operation of this market, and we are working with Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders on a co-design approach and supporting appropriate inclusion of traditional knowledge and management practices. As someone who values consultation and engagement, I am pleased that this bill mandates public consultation on methods and the instrument for measuring and assessing biodiversity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation establishes the Nature Repair Market Committee, which is responsible for providing advice to the minister following public consultation on the submission. This committee will have approximately six experts with substantial experience. They will have significant standing in one or more areas of expertise, including environmental markets, land management, agriculture, science, economics and Indigenous knowledge. Relying on the knowledge and expertise of these specialists will help us achieve better outcomes for nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature Positive Plan</span> presents a different approach to biodiversity offsets. It commits to offsets being the last resort, which will we will enshrine in legislation. Our government is already designing and consulting on new national standards for matters of national environmental significance and environmental offsets. These national standards will be legislated under the new nature-positive laws and will provide certainty and confidence in the use of biodiversity offsets under Commonwealth laws. Projects under the nature repair scheme won't be used as offsets unless and until they meet the new standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will establish a new market for investing in nature-positive outcomes. It will support Australia's international commitment to protect and repair ecosystems and reverse species decline and extinction. It will generate investment and job opportunities for a nature-positive economy whilst also creating new income streams for landholders. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  We are in the middle of a climate emergency that has been fuelled by multinational corporations, and our environment is paying the price. Right now, we require bold and urgent action to save our unique biodiversity that is under threat. Unfortunately, the first major piece of legislation the Labor environment minister has introduced is an enormous disappointment, verging on a corporate scam.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market Bill establishes the nature repair market. When first spruiking the bill, the environment minister said that it would hopefully create a 'green Wall Street', with companies making major investments in projects that protect our environment. However, in an estimates hearing on 23 May, the department of the environment conceded that they had not completed any modelling on how much investment this market could generate. Instead, the department pointed to an independent report which stated that $137 billion could be unlocked to repair and protect Australia's environment by 2050. This independent report was authorised by none other than PwC, the very same PwC that is currently under a huge international crisis after one of their partners handed over confidential Treasury information to make it easier for corporations to dodge taxes and rip off the Australian people. After releasing this independent report last year, PwC then coincidentally opened its new Centre for Nature Positive Business in April of this year. It sounds confusing and alarming. That's because this bill is exactly that, and it's not just because of PwC's involvement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How does the environment minister propose this bill will work? Under the bill, landholders like farmers, First Nations groups, corporations or local councils can conduct a project which intends to protect or preserve biodiversity. Once this project is complete or underway, they can apply for a unique biodiversity certificate from the Clean Energy Regulator. They can then sell that certificate to an interested person in the market. If you're still confused, let's imagine an example. A local council undertakes erosion mitigation work on a beach and then applies for one of these certificates. Once that is gained, the council sells it on to a corporation, like a multinational fossil fuel corporation, let's say Santos. Under this bill, Santos is well within its rights to use the certificate to offset the omissions they create by digging into the earth to profit from Australia's natural resources while making the climate crisis worse. Essentially, the exact opposite of protecting the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a reheated version of a bill the LNP introduced when they were in government. The LNP have said they might support the passage of this bill through parliament—and why wouldn't they when they wrote the original? This Labor government has committed to establishing an independent environmental watchdog and reviewing the outdated Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conversation Act. These are welcome commitments, but Labor has gone into radio silence on them. It is nonsensical to introduce this Nature Repair Market Bill before these sorely needed reforms. This is policymaking on the run, and it should be condemned. This bill is so rushed that it proposes the Clean Energy Regulator will have to approve the unique biodiversity certificates. This will require the regulator to assess environmental projects, something completely outside of their original remit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of most concern is that this bill will expand the carbon offset scheme. This scheme is under review due to the rorting undertaken by corporations and its overall inefficiency in actually delivering absolutely anything positive for the climate and environment. This time last year, the former head of the government's Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee, Professor Andrew Macintosh, said the offset is 'largely a sham'. This bill heralds the marketisation of our environment. It is simply an extension of this government's neo-liberal agenda of outsourcing its responsibilities to private interests and corporations to solve our nation's biggest issues because it is too reluctant to front up and do it itself. They're so reluctant because their funds are tied up with society-destroying projects like negative gearing or capital gains tax discounts, the stage 3 tax cuts and nuclear submarines. The action of those on the government benches do not match their supposed commitment to reversing climate change and protecting our environment. This bill wants to extend the Frankenstein scam of carbon credits in the name of protecting our wetlands, native forests and rivers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The land is a living, breathing entity. If you love the land, the earth, it'll love you back. It's just the way it's always been. Again, there's no big secret to it. If you want a relationship with the land, you just have to love it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I proudly rise to speak on this innovative piece of policy, the Nature Repair Market Bill. I, along with everyone else on this side of the chamber, know the importance of implementing programs that will leave our natural world better off for our kids and grandkids. After nearly a decade of stagnation and, to be frank, outright indifference by those opposite to the ongoing progression of climate change, this piece of legislation is one of the many steps that this government is putting in place to protect Australians and Australia's natural resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At its core, the bill is helping to support landholders, whether they are First Nations communities or farmers, to invest in the regeneration of their land. We know that landholders across Australia have begun doing this, but we need to acknowledge that while this investment can create profit in the long run, the upfront costs and short- to mid-term investment can be a hurdle for many. This legislation is the step that will get people over that very first hurdle, and it works with the government's commitment to protect 30 per cent of Australia's land and seas by 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a government are especially motivated to work quickly after the findings of the 2021<span style="font-style:italic;"> State of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment</span> report and its story of environmental degradation, loss and inaction. It is a story that paints a bleak future for Australia, a story that calls for an urgent response, a story painted on the backdrop of the Black Summer that devastated a nation. It is why we need trailblazing ideas and a multipronged approach, especially after the years of neglect under conservative governments. We know there needs to be significant investment in conservation and restoration, and while governments across all levels are stepping up, we need to find a way to make it financially viable to encourage private investment in land restoration. And that is what this bill does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, by encouraging business and private investment, will have a massive impact on individual landholders and First Nations communities looking to regenerate the land. Further, it will have a huge overall impact on the process of reversing environmental decline. We know that we can do this. Rachel Carson said in <span style="font-style:italic;">Silent Spring</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Only within the moment of time represented by the present century has one species—man—acquired significant power to alter the nature of his world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why this government stands to make sure that we contribute to altering the world for good. Goals of regeneration and protecting the environment are common across all stakeholders. Whether it's because of the worsening climate crisis evident in the intensity of the Black Summer bushfires or the widespread flooding we've seen over the last few years, these natural disasters show that more needs to be done to protect the natural world against changing conditions, and there is a hunger amongst communities to do that. Private companies, conservation groups, farmers and other landholders are increasingly looking for ways to contribute to the environment and to conservation. But there really has been no framework to allow these groups to work together to achieve this common goal. We are responding to this demand. This is an innovative effort by this government, amongst the first globally. But what this bill is doing is already deeply ingrained in Australian landholders. Regeneration efforts, research and discourse have been at the forefront of everyone's efforts, and this legislation works to support and promote those things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With organisations such as the National Farmers Federation, the Northern Land Council and Landcare all supporting this legislation, it shows the widespread support and demand for it. Landcare has said this boost from private investment will 'drive the substantial on-ground work required for repairing and protecting our precious natural assets', acknowledging that this legislation can keep up ongoing investment that sometimes gets lost in the short election and funding cycles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill doesn't just have environmental benefits. In the long term, it has a huge economic benefit. A recent report estimates the market for biodiversity in Australia could unlock $137 billion by 2050. This money will allow farmers to regenerate their land and take on projects that protect their waterways, making their properties more droughtproof and creating a healthier and happier environment. Many farmers have already started to do this, recognising the importance of implementing regeneration projects and promoting biodiversity on their farms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One farmer who has led the way for research in this field and who advocates for wider understanding of regenerative farming is Charles Massy, a fifth-generation farmer, scientist, leading pioneer in regenerative agriculture and author of <span style="font-style:italic;">Call of the Reed Warbler</span>. He admits that when he took over his family farm he was ecologically illiterate, but he asked himself: why do we have to kill things to grow things? So began his journey into regenerative agriculture, a system of cultivation that aims to put carbon back in the soil, forgoing the use of chemicals and giving us nutritious food. It puts an emphasis on using a range of plants and focusing on ground cover to improve our soil quality. He talks about how these changes brought back wildlife that had been gone from the area for years and how they had improved not only the quality of the land but also the quality of the stock that he kept on it. He said that throughout his process is 'a metaphor for us humans to once more become the enablers, the nurturers, the lovers' of self-organising and regenerative earth. We know we can't force change. We can't make landholders and farmers change from a mechanistic mindset. But we can support and incentivise good practice. We can help with education, and we're showing the long-term benefits from restoration projects and integrating conservation into farming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some other landholders who have been pioneers in nature restoration on their properties are Vince Heffernan near Yass and Will Johnson near Cargo. Vince has planted nearly 80,000 trees and shrubs across his sheep property to restore the environment to its precolonial state. He states the importance of these projects by saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If I have better biodiversity then I have an ecosystem that is more resilient. It is going to handle whatever climate change throws at it. It is going to handle fires, floods and droughts much better than an ecosystem that is liable to collapse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, Will, after planting 15,000 trees on his property, has seen productivity on the farm rapidly increase and said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bird life has increased really well, there are a lot of small, native grass birds that you see most days. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These examples show that the investment from the Nature Repair Market Bill will encourage and support more landholders to start their own projects so that they too can reap the benefits of this approach. By having more landholders on board with similar projects, this will really spearhead Australia's commitment to international agreements, making our country more disaster resilient and helping reinvent the way modern Australia engages with our land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market Bill will also enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to educate and to help promote their unique knowledge within their communities and to other landholders. It will allow them to enter this education process on their own terms. As Bill Gammage explores in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Biggest Estate on Earth</span>, First Nations populations expertly and carefully cultivated an environment that was not only sustainable but, most importantly, safe. He explains that their position on land care is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All must care for the land and its creatures, all must be regenerated by care and ceremony, no soul must be extinguished, no totem put at risk, no habitat too much reduced. That mandate, not the theology, made land care purposeful, universal and predictable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's why we are making sure that, at the forefront of these conversations and conservation regeneration, we're educating on how we can work with, not just on, the land. Gammage finishes his explanation by saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have a continent to learn. If we are to survive, let alone feel at home, we must begin to understand our country. If we succeed, one day we might become Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market Bill will allow private investment into actively engaging with these communities, which will allow them to operate and educate on their own terms and to adequately get compensated for their work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Establishing the repair market in this legislation will ensure its ongoing integrity, encouraging investment in nature and driving environmental improvements across Australia. It will allow landholders to draw on best practice to ensure quality programs for investors. The repair market will help nurture projects and deliver long-term nature-positive outcomes through activities such as weeding, planting native species and pest control. These programs can be undertaken on land or water, whether it be lakes and rivers or marine and coastal environments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will allow for open participation in extensive opportunities around the nation. The investment will allow for projects in local, regional and remote Australia through the creation of a nature-positive economy that will bring money into our local communities and create a whole industry of jobs. The nature repair market will operate with the core principles of integrity and science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides biodiversity certificates that have integrity and represent actual environmental improvement. This will allow private investors to invest with confidence and avoid the greenwashing that has become prevalent with conservation investment. There will also be an independent expert committee responsible, making sure that projects promised are delivered and of a high quality, with monitoring, reporting and notification of the delivery of project activities and progress on the environmental outcome, the ability to enforce the said outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The department, along with the ACCC and ASIC, will help enforce nature-positive plans directly, to restore public accountability and trust. All agreements will be scrutinised by both the parliament and the public. In the design of this market the government is making a priority to listen to all stakeholders for their opinions and ideas. The bill mandates public consultation on methods and the instrument for measuring and assessing biodiversity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of a government that is not only being a trailblazer in the environmental policy and trying new ideas but is also underpinning all our legislation with the election commitment we made to be a more transparent and accountable government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This piece of legislation is incredibly important and acknowledges that the government has a significant role to play in the bulk conservation and biodiversity efforts. We should also enable integrity and scientifically backed avenues for private individuals and businesses to be a part of this journey. The legislation allows all landholders to participate in the market if they can deliver long-term nature-positive outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature repair market will enable greater participation and create employment and economic opportunities. It will promote and enable free, prior and informed consent on projects on traditional landowners' land and waters. There will be opportunities to design projects that reflect the knowledge and connection to the country of our First Nations people and utilise their skill and knowledge in a nature-positive future. While it won't have an immediate effect, it is the building blocks for a sustainable future. It's just part of our plan to get Australia to be a world leader in conservation. With this, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  There's an old saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' yet this Nature Repair Market Bill tinkers with a pilot program that the coalition put forward in its Agriculture Biodiversity Stewardship Market Bill. This repair attempt has created a mess. For those reasons, at this stage, the coalition cannot support this bill. Former agriculture minister and Nationals leader David Littleproud introduced the agriculture focused bill in February 2022, but it lapsed due to an election and a change of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support market based solutions to complex issues. The alternative approach that we often see from those opposite is government based solutions. This bill has been criticised by those that you could say are on the left or far left of politics, who say that the bill actually entrusts too much to the market. These critics object to the government theoretically copping out of its perceived obligation to spend on environmental projects because private market investment through these certificates will be available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've seen in other fields, large corporations are falling over themselves to signal to the market that they're doing what Australians and people all over the world want to see large corporations doing. When you consider the scale of the multinational mining companies, in terms of their budgets, the federal budgets of many nations pale into insignificance. Whether you are comfortable with that or not is a debate for another time, but this bill maintains a focus on unlocking the immense private capital available to finance biodiversity outcomes rather than leaving it up to the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the market where we have seen great innovation and reward for effort achieved, rather than the arbitrary whims, fancies or even darker aspirations of government when it comes to the government picking winners. Some of the greatest innovations in human history and the latest technology we have in our hands have arisen from the private spaces of investors, their garages, laboratories or workshops, coming up with solutions that benefit humanity and the planet. So I welcome the government leaving the market based element of what was the Agriculture Biodiversity Stewardship Market Bill unchanged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's also remember that biodiversity is by its nature diverse and, in some respects, still unknown. It is complex. The carbon market has been simplified to a price per tonne of carbon dioxide sequestered or prevented from being emitted into the atmosphere. In the biodiversity market, how you value a biodiversity outcome will be left up to the market. This ties into work being done internationally to set standards on how these outcomes are calculated. My point is that if these are not left up to the market and international developments, we could end up with yet another level of bureaucracy here in Australia and the subsequent cost to taxpayers of pricing the value of these certificates.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is welcome that this bill doesn't tamper with the previous bill's market based mechanism. That part wasn't broken, and, thankfully, Labor haven't tried to fix it. But what they have done is inserted additional elements and opportunities for government to muddle the market, risking breaking the biodiversity market with their Orwellian nature repair. A key difference between this bill and the coalition's bill was that our bill rewarded farmers for the great biodiversity work that they already do. Let's remember that the majority of the Australian continent is agricultural land, be it private farm properties or pastoral leases. As the then agriculture minister Littleproud said when introducing the bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… farmers … play a key role in maintaining healthy ecosystems on nearly 60 per cent of Australia's land. However, their stewardship of that land is not currently valued by the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We need a national voluntary agriculture biodiversity stewardship market that recognises and financially rewards them for their efforts to restore, enhance or protect biodiversity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Littleproud went on to explain that the then proposed agriculture biodiversity stewardship market:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… would complement the voluntary carbon market, providing an incentive for farmers to establish carbon plantings that also deliver biodiversity benefits. Environmental plantings deliver carbon and biodiversity benefits, but to date, only carbon benefits have been recognised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is true, and we are breaking new ground in Australia by proposing a market for biodiversity. Labor have taken an agricultural land focused initiative and expanded it to other land and even to the oceans. They have run ahead of the pilot projects initiated under the coalition, such as the Carbon + Biodiversity Pilot, which trialled market arrangements for farmers to create a new income from plantings that deliver biodiversity improvements and carbon abatement. Eligible farmers made environmental plantings of native trees and shrubs on previously cleared land and committed to maintaining them—potentially at great cost, I might add—for 25 to 100 years. The Carbon + Biodiversity Pilot project participant farmers could also enter into a carbon abatement contract to earn Australian carbon credit units and receive a biodiversity payment. The other pilot project is the Enhancing Remnant Vegetation Pilot, enabling farmers to protect and enhance remnant vegetation on their land with tenure agreements for which they would receive a payment and/or rent and some reimbursement of their management costs. I might say that the incongruence of the Labor government now looking to put transmission lines right through that native remnant vegetation is mind-boggling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those pilot projects were meant to provide the first supply of biodiversity certificates, but now Labor has thrown open the door to almost any land under the Australian sun being open for credits. Would it not have been better to allow the pilot projects to establish how this will work and get through the prototypes and teething issues before throwing the market open to everyone? If this passes in its present form, we may never know. Let me give a brief example of how working collaboratively with farmers would have been a better approach. From my own electorate of Mallee, the Wimmera Regional Catchment Strategy states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Wimmera is a biodiversity hotspot. The region is the geographical and biological transition between temperate and arid Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The strategy says that the Wimmera features:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…the distribution of numerous 'temperate' species, like the smoky mouse (<span style="font-style:italic;">Pseudomys fumeus</span>), southern brown bandicoot (<span style="font-style:italic;">Isoodon obesulus</span>) and long-nosed potoroo (<span style="font-style:italic;">Potorous tridactylus</span>).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The strategy goes on to explain:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Formerly dominated by grassy woodlands, these areas are famed for their agricultural productivity but also support important biodiversity assets like the Wimmera grasslands, internationally significant wetlands and habitat for the critically endangered south-eastern red-tailed black cockatoo (<span style="font-style:italic;">Calyptorhynchus banksii graptogyne</span>).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are magnificent birds. The strategy goes on to explain how the remnant patches of native vegetation are extremely important to maintaining biodiversity, situated as they are, 'interspersed within the agricultural matrix'. It made sense, as the coalition was doing in working first with the farmers through the previous bill, to enhance these biodiversity stepping stones, or 'pathways', as the Wimmera Regional Catchment Strategy defines them. I understand that the initial pilot work of the coalition bill was easily adaptable to rangelands as well, and we could have expanded the market comfortably into those areas. But now the floodgates have been thrown open, and there's a risk the market could become 'not fit for purpose' in the eyes of potential investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill brings all levels of government into the market, including state governments and, at least in theory, local governments. The biodiversity enhancing work that state governments do will qualify for biodiversity certificates under this bill, so what have Labor done? They have already skewed the market. They've brought government into the game when the pilot projects were about establishing a price in the open market. Now the market involves governmental players, which will diminish what would have been the opening value of farmers' certificates under what the coalition proposed. Don't get me wrong—local government would be thrilled, in my electorate of Mallee and throughout regional Australia, with the prospect of an income stream through biodiversity certificates. However, they are already crying out that they cannot afford to maintain their roads and other services and have stretched their budgets as is. They are pulling out of providing aged care after Labor's ham-fisted implementation of the royal commission recommendations, where they failed to acknowledge the regional health crisis, the regional aged-care crisis, the regional housing crisis and the regional workforce crisis, so I'm not optimistic that, in the early nature repair market that Labor proposes, our stretched regional councils will have the budget to invest in the biodiversity work that would theoretically earn them a new income stream. In the end, most biodiversity work by governments is conducted by state governments, not local governments. Could this market have been conceived to expand state government revenue streams to offset the cost of doing biodiversity work? It is conceivable. We will see state governments get an even bigger budget and local government budgets shrink under Labor's expanded nature repair market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we debate in this place the constitutional mechanisms to enable a referendum on the Voice to Parliament for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, it is significant that Labor's Nature Repair Market Bill elevates the consent requirements for native title holders. This bill will require native title holders to be consulted and give their consent to the project much earlier than the previous bill allowed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The expansion of land to which this bill applies now also means that native title bodies will be able to apply for a biodiversity certificate. I cannot help but wonder if this is the beginning of the Voice economy. In the absence of economic development in areas controlled by a land council or similar, are Labor now creating a new income stream to compete with the market that was initially designed by the coalition for farmers to reward their on-farm conservation efforts? I'm not saying that the scheme should never have been opened up more broadly, but a deliberate, considered, pilot project has now been thrown open to all comers and, conveniently, during a debate on a voice to parliament: 'Here's a new potential income stream for Indigenous communities.' I'm not critical of economic development in Indigenous communities, but this does look like Labor's opening salvo in establishing a voice economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the summer holidays, we saw Treasurer Jim Chalmers's economic essay on restructuring the Australian economy to reflect, to put it simply, Labor values and Keynesian economics. This expansion of the coalition's model to include other land holders, adding all levels of government and Indigenous land councils, looks like it has Treasurer Chalmers's ideological fingerprints all over it. The bill is silent on the apparent offset market approach. As Leader of the Nationals David Littleproud highlighted yesterday, Labor's approach to climate regulation will now see the biggest carbon dioxide emitters hunting for offsets. The compliance time frame on carbon has been brought forward to please inner-city people who believe action on climate change isn't happening fast enough, which is going to drive emitters into the offset market. Tracts of agricultural land will be purchased to tick the box, and emitters will continue emitting. Due to the likely interconnections between biodiversity and carbon credits, we can be sure the mysterious offset arrangements, hiding to the side of this bill, will further frustrate what was, under the coalition government, a soundly developed biodiversity market.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ANANDA-RAJAH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  I rise to speak on the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and the related bill. In Australia, we pride ourselves on having a pristine natural environment, with white sandy beaches as far as the eye can see, tropical and temperate rainforests teeming with life, and the quiet power of our central desert. Our spiritual connection and economic dependency on nature is indisputable. More than half of Australia's GDP is moderately to highly dependent on nature, tourism and food production, noting that 70 per cent of our food is reliant on pollinators, such as bees, insects and bats, as are pharmaceuticals. Many of the drugs I used to dispense actually originated in nature, particularly from fungi. However, when you pull back the veil, the reality is completely different. It is confronting. This was highlighted in the Samuel review, which was released in 2020, and then confirmed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the environment </span>report, which was released in 2021. Those opposite actually suppressed this report. What it stated was that Australia's environment is in a poor and deteriorating state. When read in parallel, the picture is grim. The environment is certainly deteriorating, and it is not resilient enough to current or emerging threats. We are witnessing native species extinction, habitat loss and cultural heritage destruction, all of which are accelerating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change presents the threat multiplier, adding to competing pressures like economic development and human activity, as well as the ingress of invasive species—feral cats, foxes and gamba grass to name a few. Australia now has the ignominious title of being the mammal extinction capital of the world. Since colonisation, 100 endemic species—meaning they're only found on this continent—have become extinct, and we have one of the highest rates of species decline among countries in the OECD. There are more than 1,900 threatened species listed under the EPBC Act of which plants comprise more than half, with over 1,300 at risk of extinction. At least 19 ecosystems are showing signs of collapse or near collapse, including the Great Barrier Reef. If we keep going this way, koalas could become extinct in New South Wales before 2050. We need to pull the handbrake and course correct. We need to challenge our mental models. When we worship at the temple of GDP, nature comes off second-best. This reflects a historic failure of economics to take into account the value of our natural world. This is baffling, considering that the natural world is the source of our food, water, air and raw materials. It nourishes us, both physically and spiritually. Our current and future economies depend on our environmental capital, and that is depleting rapidly. This was always known by our First Peoples. They now seek a greater role in environmental management, and why not? Declines in biodiversity are much slower on lands governed by First Peoples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Halting the degradation is important. This is outlined in our threatened species plan—a commitment to prevent new extinctions of plants and animals. Conserving an additional 50 million hectares of our land mass equating to 30 per cent of our land in addition to 30 per cent of our oceans is something that we want to do. We are prioritising 110 species and 20 places for conservation. These were chosen based on a set of criteria and represent our diverse land, sea and freshwater environments. Let's meet some of these critters. We have 22 birds—among them are the malleefowl, the red-tailed black cockatoo and the regent honeyeater. There are 21 mammals, including the Australian sea lion, the quokka and the western ringtail possum. There are nine fish, including the grey nurse shark. We have six frogs—frogs are like the canaries in the coal mine; when they die, it should raise alarm bells and red flags—and among them is the mountain frog.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do more than protect nature; we need to go further and repair it. The scale of the problem—I mean, we are talking about reversing extinction here—means that government cannot do this alone. We need to co-opt private investment, just as we are doing with tackling climate change. It's time for a so-called green Wall Street. The nature repair market is a novel market mechanism to repair nature by attracting business and the private sector to the task. Business is brimming with innovative ideas. These can now be directed to restoring biodiversity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NRM aligns with target 21 of the threatened species plan by encouraging private sector investment linked to a tradeable green bond or a biodiversity certificate. It will allow landowners, farmers, conservation groups, First Nations communities, businesses and philanthropists to invest in repairing nature, either on land or in water. Possible projects might include excluding livestock and feral animals to restore a natural marsh for frogs, fish, turtles and water birds; replanting a vital corridor of koala habitat; or restoring seagrass meadows, providing refuge for turtles, dugongs, fish and seahorses, which will in turn increase local fish stocks, with benefits to commercial and recreational fishermen. It may mean planting a mix of local species on previously cleared land, feral animal exclusion, buffer grass removal or cultural burning in the Central Desert. It may also mean repairing damaged river beds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a young person of today, imagine the career opportunities and the spillover effects. This bill will formalise the participation of First Peoples by creating employment and economic opportunities for them on their country, using their knowledge of country, only now it will be commodified. There are huge opportunities for First Nations communities who have rights or interests over approximately 50 per cent of Australia's land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're repairing what's broken and protecting what's good. We understand that any investment in the nature repair market should not substitute for legislative protection, which is why we have committed to conserving 30 per cent of our land and water, with much of the focus being on terrestrial assets—land—from the current 22 per cent protection base line. Within the five-year term of the Threatened Species Action Plan, we will aim for an increase of 50 million hectares of land and sea—that is massive—managed for conversation by 2027, putting us on a trajectory to meet our 30 per cent goal by 2030. The time lines are long, often measured in decades, because reversing decline and preventing threatened species loss takes time, but it starts locally, with a million ideas and, hopefully, native flowers blooming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that economic field of flowers look like? According to PwC it could be $137 billion unlocked by 2050. That is an untapped demand with the holy trinity of social, environmental and economic benefits. Major organisations, including the ACF, the WWF, the National Farmers Association and BCA—the Business Council of Australia—have provided in principle support. The bill will enable the Clean Energy Regulator, an independent statutory authority, to issue biodiversity certificates. Biodiversity certificates can then be traded between companies wanting to invest in nature and/or to enhance their environmental credentials. These certificates will be linked to a measurable outcome, because we need to be certain that proven gains are actually achieved. We have to give the market confidence and we want to put greenwashing aside.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, the ACCC and ASIC will be involved so that buyers can then invest with confidence, avoiding accusations of greenwashing. Offsets in the scheme are seen as a last resort. Why? Because averting loss is not good enough. We want to remediate and restore. We will develop separately a national environmental standard for offsets associated with a hierarchy of actions where we avoid, reduce, use and offset or pay, exchanging like for like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The independent Nature Repair Market Committee will oversee the delivery of nature-positive outcomes, to give the scheme integrity. Comprising five to six experts in agriculture, science, environmental markets, land management, economics or Indigenous knowledge, it will consult with the public and provide advice to the minister. This advice will be made public. Transparency will be a core element of the scheme; a public register of projects and certificates will be maintained to ensure that all transactions are transparent. This will enable public scrutiny of projects via parliament and via citizen oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to incentivise the restoration of nature by mobilising private investment. The demand is there and we're now providing the framework to enable those green shoots to emerge and grow. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  I rise to speak on the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023. Around 180 million years ago, the supercontinent of Gondwana split. One of the breakaway landmasses from that separation contained what would become known as Australia and Antarctica. Within 30 million years, Australia had fully separated and journeyed north on its own. Since then, changes in land formation and climate, and physical separation from the rest of the world, have led to the evolution of the unique flora and fauna we know in Australia today. Indeed, as a nation we're home to between 600,000 to 700,000 species, many of which are found nowhere else in the world. And, while the word 'biodiversity' is a scientific word, its meaning is simple: it describes the incredible array of different types of life we find around us and the delicate balance that exists between them all. It's a balance which enables them not just to survive but to thrive. It is this balance which is under threat globally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of North Sydney is home to open scrub, dominated by black she-oaks, gully forests, estuarine mangrove forests on intertidal mudflats and estuarine saltmarshes, as well as sandstone rainforests, forest red gum and foreshore forests. And yet in this area, often referred to as the 'leafy Lower North Shore', we have 60 threatened species. Those are creatures like the powerful owl, the Regent honeyeater, the grey-headed flying fox and the giant burrowing frog, all of which called the geography now covered by my electorate home long before European settlement, but all of which are now facing the existential threat of annihilation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, biodiversity creates balance, and every life form plays a part in maintaining that balance. If we lose the bacteria that purify the water then the trees will not be able to get the water they need. As a result, many animals will lose their food source. As humans, we rely on this rich variety of nature for things like clean drinking water, food, medicine and shelter, and yet right across the country our unique nature is under threat. Prior to European settlement, diverse bushland habitats covered the gullies and ridge tops of the North Sydney Council area within my electorate. Today, less than five per cent of these unique vegetation communities remain and, due to our human-modified landscape, all are vulnerable to ongoing urban pressures. In the minister's own words, we're now 'the mammal extinction capital of the world', having lost more species than any other continent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that Australia has lost more mammal species than any other continent and has one of the highest rates of species decline in the developed world should be a source of national shame, yet for the preceding two decades the findings and reviews completed since the introduction of the EPBC Act in 1999 have quite literally been ignored. As a consequence, more than a hundred Australian species have been listed as either extinct or extinct in the wild, with the major causes of extinction being introduced species and habitat destruction and clearing. Meanwhile, the recent state of the environment report made it clear. In the past five years the number of threatened ecological communities has grown by another 20 per cent, and for the first time we have more foreign plant species than native ones in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking to my own community, its level of awareness, key concerns and expectations were all clearly delivered to me, not only through direct conversations but via the results of a recent survey, which showed the vast majority of my community is very concerned about the dire state of Australia's natural environment. I'm worried we're not acting fast enough. My community is clear: success in this area must be measured in biodiversity repair and conservation, not just by a reduction in degradation. We must make every effort to rejuvenate nature. In the words of one resident, 'This is not a time for business as usual.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of a challenge of this scale, then, this government and this parliament have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to conceive and introduce truly transformational legislation to bring our nation together, uniting all levels of government: local, state and national. Private individuals, landholders, farmers, natural resource management groups, investors and banks, and businesses—large and small—must be a priority for us. Last night, I hosted an online community forum for my electorate, during which those in attendance heard from both the environment sector and the business sector. Both said that now is the time for action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone recognises the size of this challenge and is ready to work with the government to deliver a bold solution, and herein lies the rub with what we have before us. While the size of the challenge is well known, the government has chosen to start the process of looking at how we approach transformation by focusing on a small piece of the solution—the establishment of a nature repair market. It's a decision that confuses many and leaves them concerned that the government will be looking to personal and business investment to fix the problem, rather than ensuring it stays front and centre in driving action by prioritising the agreement of national environment standards and establishing the equivalent of a national environment protection agency, which the government has now given the working title Environment Information Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, my community fundamentally believes we should be debating a full suite of legislation that would deliver on the government's election commitment to bolster national environmental laws and introduce new national standards for development assessments in this place, in this moment. Improving the state of the environment requires national leadership; integrated management across federal, state and territory systems; new forms of funding; and improved monitoring and reporting. The sequencing should be that we have those reforms laid out before us before we debate this market mechanism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the Samuel review that the current EPBC Act is unfit for purpose and is failing to meet its objectives. As Professor Samuel himself concluded:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To shy away from the fundamental reforms recommended by this Review is to accept the continued decline of our iconic places and the extinction of our most threatened plants, animals and ecosystems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have indicated they will deliver stronger laws designed to repair nature, to protect precious plants, animals and places, alongside national environmental standards to describe the environment outcomes we want to achieve and a new environment protection agency to make development decisions and properly enforce them, yet that's not what this legislation does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is many in my community are confused as to why the government is introducing a market based solution as its first priority, given the size and scope of the new environmental reforms required. North Sydney residents have told me that this bill should not replace proper reform and environmental protection laws; it should play a small part in a much bigger change to protect our natural environment. What we have before us not only puts the cart before the horse but drives it all the way to the market. We do not have stronger laws in place. We do not have national environmental standards. We do not have an agency to enforce the laws and the standards. My community fears that, without these as a strong foundation for reform, the market based scheme that this bill establishes may well fail, and failure in biodiversity protection could lead to perverse outcomes and set all efforts back significantly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's for these reasons that I not only support the second reading amendments moved by the members for Wentworth and Goldstein but also will be moving a number of proposed amendments during the consideration in detail debate to encourage the government to expedite broader reforms onto the same trajectory. The market should not be operational until (1) the new offsets national environmental standard is legally enforceable; and (2) the new Environment Protection Agency is legally established. The minister has indicated that these reforms are on their way, with an exposure due in the second half of 2023, so my amendment allows for a 12-month period for the broader reforms, within which this repair market would sit, to be developed, debated and passed. It is clear the government must take the lead in addressing the biodiversity and extinction crisis we face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this broader context in mind and essential root-and-branch reforms on the horizon, I consider the Nature Repair Market Bill a small step in the right direction. As I have outlined, the size of the challenge to enhance, protect and maintain our biodiversity requires all comers. This bill will make it easier for businesses, philanthropists and others to invest in repairing nature across Australia, allowing landowners to be paid by a third party for protecting and restoring nature on their property. Some of the programs the scheme might support include farmers removing invasive weeds and animals to give space for native animals and plants, or Indigenous rangers controlling feral animals. Groups like Landcare Australia have said it will encourage good landholder management of ecosystem services, such as restoration and protection of native habitat, with benefits for biodiversity, soil stabilisation, water quality and carbon sequestration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the intent of the bill, but, in order to ensure optimal outcomes for people and nature, the bill must be strengthened. I was sent to Canberra by my community of North Sydney on a platform of more ambitious, more rapid action to address climate change. The impacts of climate change, including drought, bushfires, storms, ocean acidification, sea level rise and global warming, on our ecosystems is clear. We know many plants and animals cannot adapt to the effects of climate change, with 1,000 plant and animal species and ecological communities already at risk of extinction in New South Wales alone. In addition, we must recognise that action on nature repair cannot happen in isolation to action on climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overwhelmingly my community of North Sydney has told me the No. 1 priority for the environment portfolio is to address the underlying causes of poor biodiversity, which are human impacts, invasive species and climate related impacts. For this reason, I'm also proposing to amend the objects of this act to ensure that climate change drivers and impacts are incorporated and integrated into every step of environmental and biodiversity protection. The amendment adds to the objects of the act the objective:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to promote the enhancement or protection of biodiversity against the urgent threat of climate change, drawing on the best available scientific knowledge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This wording mirrors that which was recently passed through the Climate Change Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there are many concerning findings and recommendations from Professor Samuel, perhaps the most worrying is that the community and industry do not trust the EPBC Act and the regulatory system that underpins its implementation. In this context, strong new institutions are essential to ensure the EPBC Act can be trusted to deliver the environmental outcomes required. A dominant theme in the 30,000 or more contributions received by the Samuel review was that many in the community do not trust the EPBC Act to deliver for the environment, and that institutional reform should promote transparency, accountability and integrity in the administration of the act, and monitoring, evaluation and improvement in the delivery of environmental outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context again I will be moving amendments to ensure the Clean Energy Regulator's activities reports and the Secretary's report on biodiversity certificates must not only be published on relevant websites but also tabled in parliament within 15 sitting days after the end of the financial year—again, mirroring similar amendments that I moved and that were successfully made to the climate bills. Tabling reports to the operation of regulatory schemes like the nature repair market promotes transparency and accountability. As the Scrutiny of Bills Committee outlines, there should be appropriate justification for not requiring the documents to be tabled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said previously in this place, Australian voters voted to have politics done differently. To do so, we must ensure information is shared beyond the minister and the two parties to the whole of parliament and, ultimately, our constituencies. Only through the consistent, accessible and timely provision of information are we able to do our jobs thoroughly as parliamentarians and can our communities hold us to account. As a North Sydney community member urged me: 'Let's not distract or shift accountability from the core challenge, Kylea.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister, the government, all of us in this place and all of our communities must work together to stop the extinction crisis before it is too late. The <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report written in 2021 told us:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the state and trend of the environment of Australia are poor and deteriorating as a result of increasing pressures from climate change, habitat loss, invasive species, pollution and resource extraction. Changing environmental conditions mean that many species and ecosystems are increasingly threatened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the next report due in 2026, all of us in this place and across our communities should be prepared to hold ourselves to account for ensuring we pursue more than an expedient headline. Learning from the mistakes of the past, adopting the very clear and sensible recommendations of those who have looked at this challenge long and hard and ensuring any legislation we prioritise or pursue ultimately not just protects but restores and repairs our precious native flora, fauna and ecosystems. To do anything less is to fail to meet both the obligations and the opportunities presented to us as parliamentarians in this 47th parliament. Let's lead boldly and show that politics can be done differently to generate positive, sustainable change. I can guarantee that our great-great-grandchildren will thank us for it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  I rise to today to speak to the Albanese Labor government's approach to making our nation nature positive. The Nature Repair Market Bill is a bill that will benefit the environment and everyone that interacts with it. This bill will contribute to that vision, and the people of Boothby will benefit from this. My electorate is one of the most environmentally diverse in the state. Boothby spans the southern suburbs of Adelaide and, while an urban environment, has an ecosystem and biota representations spanning from coastal and marine ecosystems through to urban wetlands and rivers right up to the hills to the beautiful Belair National Park.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Belair National Park, which is just 25 minutes from the Adelaide CBD, is South Australia's oldest and most accessible national park, spanning over eight square kilometres. It has amazing fauna, like bandicoots, echidnas, kangaroos, emus and the brown butterfly, as well as beautiful flora, like spider orchids, scented sundews and blue devil flowers. Down on the plains of my electorate, we have some of the best urban wetlands Adelaide has to offer. The Warraparinga Wetland along the Sturt River is a rich piece of biodiversity in my electorate, as well as such an important and sacred site to the local Kaurna people in Boothby. It's looked after by the Friends of Warriparinga.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A little further downstream on the Sturt River, we also have a more recently established Oaklands Park Wetland. It's another pit stop for species of birds travelling up from the river and cared for by the Friends of Sturt River. If you follow the river downstream, you reach the ocean and the beaches, like Glenelg and Brighton, which have beautiful marine environments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud to be part of a government that is serious about being nature positive. To be nature positive is such a simple concept, yet it's something that we struggle with. Nature positive is more than just no more decline to nature. The government is not only stopping decline; we actually want to repair the damage and finally give back to the environment. We have taken from the environment for far too long. This government wants to give back, repair the natural environment and rebuild. The Albanese Labor government has taken this philosophy to all of its environmental commitments. This ambitious plan sees the environment put back front and centre, where it belongs. The Australian government has committed to protecting 30 per cent of Australia's land and seas by 2030, a commitment that recognises that the environment has been in decline and sets out to reverse this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same goals have been adopted globally under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. Biodiversity loss and nature decline is not an issue facing just Australia. It is a global issue, and one that we must all act upon. These goals reinforce the findings of the 2021 <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the environment</span> report and its story of environmental degradation, loss and inaction. The report is a sobering read that shows the reality of where we are with environmental decline in this country, and I'm proud that this government has reviewed the science and is acting accordingly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My home state of South Australia is well positioned for protecting 30 per cent land and sea by 2030. In fact, we have achieved such a goal already. It is more about the quality of such areas, helping communities look after them and valuing these areas. That's why we need a nature repair market. This legislation allows for investment in the environment for a nature-positive future and to protect these precious areas, empowering community groups as well as business and private sector investment. This approach to investment was highlighted in the findings of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act review by Professor Graeme Samuel AC. We know private companies, conservation groups and farmers and other landholders are eager for ways to achieve positive outcomes for nature. We need to bring all people that interact with the environment along with us on this journey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not just good environmentally, it's also good from a financial perspective. It's estimated that the market for biodiversity in Australia could unlock $137 billion in financial flows by 2050. We are responding to that demand. We can bring together these groups that want to look after the environment and empower them to consider the environment in  their business models. We want to build a system that is self-reinforcing so it has a future that isn't dependent on a government pushing it all the time but has momentum and drives itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is designed to enable the Clean Energy Regulator, an independent statutory authority that has significant experience in regulating environmental markets, to issue Australian landholders with tradeable biodiversity certificates. These certificates can then be onsold to businesses, organisations, governments and individuals. The market is designed to be accessible to all landholders, including Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, conservation groups and farmers. It is designed for long-term nature-positive outcomes achieved through activities such as weed reduction, planting native species and pest control. These activities can be undertaken on land or water, including in lakes and rivers, as well as in marine and coastal environments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The market will also operate in parallel with the carbon market, facilitated by having the same regulator, the Clean Energy Regulator. Not only should Australians have confidence in this bill, as these markets exist in similar areas, but the scheme will also partner with these other markets, strengthening and complementing each other. The alignment will encourage carbon farming projects that also deliver benefits for biodiversity. There will be administrative efficiencies in this approach and, more importantly, clear and accurate oversight of claims made in both markets. The government acknowledges our recent review of carbon crediting, led by Professor Ian Chubb. Lessons learnt from the carbon market have informed the bill and will continue to be reflected upon as environmental markets develop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Establishing the market in legislation will ensure its ongoing integrity, encourage investment in nature and drive environmental improvements across Australia. This will build confidence in the market for buyers to invest. The bill provides for biodiversity certificates to have integrity and represent an actual environmental improvement. A key integrity measure is an independent expert committee responsible for ensuring projects deliver high-quality nature-positive outcomes underpinned by a consistent approach to the measurement, assessment and verification of biodiversity. The integrity of environmental outcomes is also enabled through assurance and compliance requirements. These include monitoring, reporting and notification on the delivery of project activities and progress on an environmental outcome. The regulator will have monitoring and enforcement powers to ensure that projects are conducted in accordance with the rules.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature Positive Plan</span> reflects our commitment to restoring public accountability and trust. Transparency will be a core element of the scheme. Comprehensive information about projects and certificates will be available on a public register. Additional information will be regularly published by the regulator, and there will be an active release of relevant data by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. This will enable parliament and the public to monitor the scheme and provide an opportunity for citizen oversight. It will provide certainty and value to the market. The department is committed to working with the ACCC and ASIC to ensure that certificates issued in the nature repair market are not victims of greenwashing, that the statements made about certificates accurately reflect the projects and investment that they represent, and that projects in the carbon and biodiversity markets are not affected by misleading claims.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature repair market will enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to promote their unique knowledge, on their terms. It will enable participation and create employment and economic opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It will promote and enable free, prior and informed consent for projects on their waters and lands. There will be opportunities to design projects that reflect the knowledge and connection to country of our First Nations people and to utilise their skills and knowledge for a nature-positive future. South Australia already has fantastic work being conducted in Indigenous protected areas, in co-managed parks and in landscape board regions, more broadly known as natural resource management boards. Indigenous rangers have been hired in these areas to facilitate this work and the unique knowledge. The nature repair market is also designed to support regional Australians, with open participation and extensive opportunities for project locations, creating jobs and nature-positive economic activity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill will not only benefit the environment; it will benefit all of those who have a relationship with the environment. This bill is designed to leave nature better off for our kids and grandkids. The Albanese Labor government knows what it means to be nature positive. Let's help Australians achieve this too.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I rise to speak on the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023. I declare that I am a landholder. I have interests in both freehold and leasehold land in Central Queensland, and the details of my landholdings can be found on my statement of interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this bill is to create biodiversity credits, along similar lines to energy generating credits, which will enable landholders to obtain tradeable certificates to be used in a similar way to carbon offsets. These proposed certificates would be administered by the Clean Energy Regulator, and they would be a national voluntary market incentive. There are issues which have substantial ramifications for the agriculture, mining and resources, forestry and fishing that could last for generations if these voluntary agreements are made. While this was originally an initiative of the previous government, it has been substantially widened in scope, and as such the future ramifications will not be fully understood by those taking up these agreements or by the general public. The biodiversity agreements will last for periods of 25 years or up to 100 years in duration. Such long periods of time do not allow for the ever-changing political climate, both domestic and international, nor do they consider fluctuating economic demand and supply, which change with time and which are a complete unknown 100 years from today. There is no allowance to adjust or change these commitments should the need arise. Furthermore, the agriculture, mining and resources, forestry and fishing sectors could possibly be forced to take up these biodiversity credits for economic reasons which do not help the future overall economy of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is literally proposing to legally lock up land so that it will see no production for generations. The bill proposes to include virtually all types of land tenure, including the territorial waters of Australia, regardless of ownership or legal right. This would include all native title areas, including exclusive-possession native title. It would include all Crown land and Australian waters, irrespective of whether that land or those waters are subject to lease or licence, including whether the land or water is subject to native title agreement or application. The bill would include all Torrens system land title, which is basically all freehold land. In effect, what the government is proposing is that it would be possible to commit vast areas of Australian land and waters to a zero production scenario to help achieve the commitment to net zero by 2050. Paragraph 69 on page 23 of the explanatory memorandum says that 'native title land will be either Crown land or Torrens system land'. This would include all grazing homestead perpetual lease, forestry grazing lease and freehold agricultural land. At paragraph 77, the EM states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In practice, this means that all biodiversity projects to be carried out on native title land or waters would need either to be undertaken by the relevant native title holders, or would require the consent of the relevant native title holders before the project could be registered. This would ensure that native title holders have the final say—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">have the final say—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">on whether, and what kind of, biodiversity projects are carried out on or in native title areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, the native title holders would have control over much of agricultural Australia, should people wish to take up these biodiversity agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's explanatory notes say that the bill would enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to 'promote their unique knowledge on their terms'. What exactly does that mean? Is the minister suggesting in this statement that, if you are of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, by birthright, you are automatically gifted some sort of knowledge that enables you to better manage land and have better outcomes than anybody else? This is just absurd. Define 'unique knowledge on their terms'. Are we supposed to surrender to this unsubstantiated knowledge, which could encapsulate anything, with no boundaries or parameters? I have no issue at all with Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people having an input, but giving this group of people exclusive right of veto or approval over a proposed agreement is something I take great exception to. This is specifically eroding the rights of everybody else and legally legislating the final say to Aboriginal corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, to be given the ability to impose requirements, as well as prohibiting specific activities, is outrageous. Recently, we have seen several instances of this sort of thing happening. The beach at Burrum Heads in Queensland is now closed to all those except native titleholders. No longer can you climb Mount Warning apparently because of some cultural heritage claim, which in my view is totally unsubstantiated. We have seen name changes at Fraser Island, for example. What's next—no tourists, no fishing, no camping? Is that where we're going with this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is proposing to allow a small group of Australians the ability to impose requirements on all others and prohibit activities with respect to biodiversity credit agreements. Where does this take us as a nation? Is this what Australians want? I think not. As a matter of fact, I think there are a large number of Australians who would vehemently disagree with this. This, in effect, is legislating certain control to a specific group of Australians. Where have we heard that one before? The Voice. Is this where we're going? Are we legislating principles of the Voice? This warrants an explanation by the minister. The Australian people want to know, and I would like to know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's assume that a company has a mining lease on a piece of Crown land, and they want to make a biodiversity agreement on that land—on the mining lease—and claim credits. They would then have to seek approval from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who would now have the power to approve or disapprove the biodiversity agreement and, therefore, the potential to stop the mining development altogether, unless the rent-seeking agendum is adhered to. I have no doubt the Greens and the radical Left will love this, as they want to stop all gas and coal production in Australia. In the explanatory memorandum, on page 5, under the heading 'Registration of biodiversity projects', the notes say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the registered native title body corporate would be able to consent to another person being the project proponent and carrying out the project in or on the native title area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way I read that is that an environmental group or any other particular group could make an agreement with an Aboriginal body, make a biodiversity project agreement, take over vast areas of land and lock it up for possibly a hundred years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will affect agriculture, mining, resources, forestry and fisheries—the very industries that are the basic economic generators of wealth in this country. It would be locking up land for possibly a hundred years that would become a haven for any number of feral pests and invasive and noxious weed species. To make a comparison, our national parks are already overrun with any number of these feral and invasive noxious weed species. They are mismanaged, become firetraps and, ultimately, destroy more nature than what they save.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The very title of the bill—nature repair bill—has inference. It is saying that nature is broken. Nature is not broken. In fact, it is alive and well. Mother Nature is relentless, unforgiving, cruel and heartless, and, at the same time, beautiful, bountiful, nurturing and loving. Above all, nature is adaptive, flexible and changing. One rule applies: survival of the fittest, and it gives no quarter to the weak. I would argue that there are very few places left in Australia that you could call 'pristine'. The Australian ecosystem has changed, and it will not be undone. There are donkeys, horses, camels, pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, cane toads, fire ants, carp and any number of weed species—rubber vine, lantana, mother-of-millions, parthenium, lovegrass, giant rat's-tail grass and parkinsonia, just to name a few. The point is that, if we lock up vast areas of Australia for biosecurity credits with no management, Mother Nature will ensure the survival of the fittest to the detriment of the native flora and fauna of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We struggle to manage our feral pests and invasive species now, and by locking more of Australia up this problem will get worse. Up in the hills here, south and west of Canberra, we can't even control the feral horse population, causing enormous environmental damage, all because of some bleeding-heart 'Man from Snowy River'<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>mentality. What guarantees are there that biodiversity credits will provide better environmental outcomes? Page 3 of the explanatory notes says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Buyers are expecting to be able to invest in nature to achieve philanthropic objectives, meet their social and environmental responsibilities, compensate for their impacts on nature and manage risks associated with their dependencies on nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll translate that statement. The wealthy virtue-signalling elite want to invest billions of dollars in Australian agricultural land, lock it up and forget about it to appease their own self-loathing of their irresponsible lifestyles while they continue their jet-setting, latte-sipping affluence, whilst priorly declaring they're environmentally aware. This is just some more of the monumental hypocrisy we hear from metropolitan Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To sum this bill up, the government is proposing to create a system of voluntary biodiversity credits on Australian agricultural land that could possibly see it locked up for 100 years. This, in theory, will help big industry and the wealthy achieve the government's 43 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. The bill also gives right of veto or consent to a small group of Australians, eroding the rights of others. In effect, agricultural Australia, if they choose to take up these biodiversity agreements, will, in some cases, be in the position of having to pay rent to Aboriginal land councils. Once again, it's agriculture, mining, resources, fisheries and forestry that will pay the cost of zero net carbon policy, which, in terms of the rest of the world, is achieving absolutely nothing. It's for these reasons that I oppose the bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  The Albanese Labor government is committed to leaving a better world for future generations. We want to ensure that our kids, grandkids and each generation that comes after that inherit a planet that is healthy, vibrant and sustainable. We know that repairing our environment is not easy, but it will be a collective effort. That's why we're proposing to work with landholders, including farmers and First Nations communities, to take action on creating a more sustainable Australia. Whether it's through planting native species, repairing damaged riverbeds or removing invasive species, we want to do the work to restore and retain the natural beauty and wonder of our great country. That's why the Nature Repair Market Bill is a groundbreaking piece of legislation that will make it easier for people to invest in activities that will help repair our country and our planet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By creating a market for nature repair we're providing an opportunity for those who care about the environment and the longevity of our planet to collaborate and contribute to its restoration and preservation. The purpose of the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 is to provide a framework to establish a voluntary national market in biodiversity certificates. The bill will allow for project proponents to undertake projects to enhance and protect Australia's biodiversity. They can then apply to the Clean Energy Regulator, where one can obtain a biodiversity certificate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is one of 17 megadiverse countries with a disproportionate political responsibility for conservation and biodiversity management. Even though Australia occupies just five per cent of the world's landmass, we support almost 12.5 per cent of vertebrate animals—that is, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals—and eight per cent of all described plant, animal and fungal species. In addition, 85 per cent of Australia's plants, animals, reptiles and amphibians are endemic—that is, they are found nowhere else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most recent state of the environment report, 2021, released by the Minister for the Environment and Water in July 2022—it was held back and hidden by the former government but rightfully released by the minister for the environment soon after our election in May 2022—found that Australia's native plant and animal species are in a poor or very poor and deteriorating state. Our aquatic ecosystems are also in a poor state, with the aquatic ecosystem condition in southern, eastern and south-western Australia in a very poor state. Marine habitats, species and ecosystem processes are in a predominantly good and stable condition; however, reefs and reef associated species are in a poor condition and deteriorating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the state of the environment report brings to light is the mounting cumulative impacts of a multitude of poorly addressed threats to biodiversity, including climate change, habitat disturbance and land clearing, invasive species, fishing, extractive industries and pollution—threats that were ignored and, in the case of this report, hidden by the former Liberal government. Leading Australian scientists have identified 19 Australian ecosystems that are already collapsing, and these include the Murray-Darling river basin and the Great Barrier Reef, which have until now underpinned significant sectors of the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been many studies that have explored the adequacy of funding for biodiversity conservation in Australia, the funding need and the direct value of ecosystem services provided by nature. These studies found that Australia spends just 15 per cent of what is needed to avoid extinctions and recover threatened species. By spending approximately $2 billion annually for 30 years, we could restore 13 million hectares of degraded land without affecting intensive agriculture or urban areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this, approximately half of Australia's GDP has a moderate to very high direct dependence on ecosystem services provided by nature. In the last quarter of 2022, the minister for the environment formally presented the Albanese government's response to both the state of the environment report and the Samuel review. This includes the <span style="font-style:italic;">2022-2032 Threatened species action plan: towards zero extinctions</span>. The revision of the former government's threatened species action plan includes new objectives preventing new extinctions and a commitment to conserving and protecting at least 30 per cent of Australia's landmass. If you look at the state of the environment report, that's the very least that we can do.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has put forward the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Positive Plan</span>, which is better for the environment and better for business. Now that commitments made in the lead-up to the election have been formalised and the government has responded to the Samuel review, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Positive Plan </span>brings forward reforms including reform of the EPBC Act, centred on national environment standards; the creation of an independent environmental protection agency; greater use of regional planning and improved conservation planning arrangements; reform of environmental offsets; the creation of a nature repair market; increased access to environmental data information; and better working relationships with our First Nations people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister described the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature Positive Plan</span> as the biggest environmental reform agenda in a generation. The minister has indicated that legislation to implement reforms to the EPBC Act would be released as an exposure draft before the end of this year, and I look forward to contributing on that bill. The NRM bills we're discussing today are timely and will empower the minister to make biodiversity assessment instruments and methodology determinations setting out specific requirements for how distinct types of biodiversity projects may be implemented. They will establish the important Nature Repair Market Committee to advise the minister, including on whether biodiversity assessment instruments are appropriate and whether determinations are consistent with the standards. They will require the CER to maintain an online platform to facilitate trading in these biodiversity certificates. We know that biodiversity and nature are greatly important to Australia, not only to underpin cultural and spiritual systems but to provide educational and scientific opportunities and a critical ecosystem for services which underpin our economic and social systems, not only here in Australia but the world over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The efforts of parties under the biodiversity convention, which is an international agreement, have largely failed, which has led to the establishment of further biodiversity frameworks. This framework outlines four high-level goals to be achieved by 2050 and 23 action oriented targets to be achieved by 2030, including at least 30 per cent of areas of degraded terrestrial land to be restored. This is an incredibly important step. Prior to the development of that framework, it was determined that more funding needed to be put towards this. This bill will help establish markets to provide a mechanism to do that. The Nature Repair Market Bill is a way for the Albanese Labor government to deliver on its plan through establishment of this market. It will make it easier for businesses and individuals to protect nature through investing in projects. In a world where we know climate change is having a real impact on the day to day and on our economy, we are working very hard to ensure Australia is habitable and safe for generations to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investment in conservation and restoration is imperative for a nature-positive future, and it's important that businesses have the opportunity to prevent environmental decline by investing in the very environment they benefit from. We know that greenwashing is a problem and something that our regulators are actively investigating. Through this bill, we will provide a mechanism for businesses to have the opportunity to invest in something that will really make a difference, something that will be regulated and above board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples will be able to promote their unique knowledge in establishing the market. Establishing the market in legislation will ensure its integrity, ensure investment in nature and create environmental improvements across Australia. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples will also have greater employment and economic opportunities, as they will be able to design projects on their land and waters that reflect the connection they have to the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This market will operate in parallel with the carbon market in order to encourage carbon farming projects that deliver benefits for biodiversity. The approach will be efficient and draw upon lessons learnt from prior involvements in the carbon market reflected continuously throughout the development of the environmental market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Transparency is so important as part of this bill. Detailed information about projects and certificates will be available to be accessed by the public. Information will be consistently published by a regulator, and the relevant data will be released by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. This will allow the parliament and, importantly, the public to monitor the scheme, to provide feedback and to have confidence in the scheme. The department is committed to working with the ACCC and ASIC to prevent greenwashing claims from certificates used in the nature repair market. It's important that the statements made about certificates are accurate and that they reflect the projects they represent rather than being misleading.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In prior decades, successive governments have failed to address the key drivers of a cumulative loss in biodiversity, such as land clearing, intensive agriculture and intensive resource projects. It's imperative these issues are addressed as soon as possible in order to prevent the consequences they bring about. That's what the repair market bills and the establishment of this market are all about. The issue of comprehensive reform of our national environmental laws in order to adequately protect Australia's unique biodiversity remains high on the Albanese Labor government's agenda. These bills provide an outline for the creation of a market in biodiversity certificates, allowing the private sector to price something that's invaluable for the purposes of their claim. It's a good way for our good corporate citizens to get involved in repairing our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key elements of this repair market bill will be provided in subordinate legislation, including rules, biodiversity assessment instruments and methodology determinations. The bill and explanatory memorandum will allow the development of methodologies to focus on the restoration and protection of habitat that's critical for threatened species and ecological communities. This bill will address the need to live on a more sustainable planet that can be enjoyed by us and future generations to come. I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  I rise to speak on the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023. We wouldn't leave the minimum wage of some of our most vulnerable workers up to the market. It's accepted, including, I think, by this government that we need regulation to step in because there's a power imbalance. And if we don't put things in law to protect people then the market, which very often means big corporations having more power than others, gets its way. And that would mean wages go down. That's why we have minimum wages and award wages putting in more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In aged care, we wouldn't say, 'Well, we'll just leave it all up to the market.' It's because we know that if for-profit providers come in and decide to make a profit out of aged care and there are no minimum standards in law then they will drive the standard of care into the ground just to make a quick buck. That's why we have laws in place which are meant to protect people, because we know that corporations will do what corporations do: seek to make a profit. That's what they're there for. Government needs to step in and provide protections in law because the market won't do it. We know that with wages and we know that with care for looking after people. But when it comes to protecting the environment from greedy developers who are destroying habitat right across this country and contributing to the extinction crisis, this government says: 'We'll leave all that up to the market. Let's turn that over to the market and leave it up to them.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first significant environment bill that they have brought in here doesn't put in place strong standards to protect the environment and doesn't deal with the climate crisis, the biggest threat to our precious environment according to the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the envi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ronment report</span>. What do they do? They bring a bill into this place that says, 'Let's turn nature into a market.' It's in the title of the bill! The minister went on to say, 'We want to have a green Wall Street.' Well, Wall Street crashed, Minister Plibersek! Why do you want to put protection of our environment into the hands of the stock market? Into the hands of speculators? Into the hands of people who only exist to make a buck? This is critical when it comes to protecting our precious environment—it's as critical there just as much as it is with wages or aged care, where the government is willing, rightly, to step in and regulate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is that? Because we know that some of the biggest threats—for example, to koala species—and one of the biggest threats, driving the extinction crisis in this country, are developers coming in and destroying land that's currently habitat and environment. That's what developers do. Instead of putting in place strong protections, the government says: 'Let's turn it into a market,' and there are no protections in this bill; so much is left up to the minister, 'Let's make it so that developers can come and say, 'We're going to destroy that koala habitat, but it's okay because we're going to pay to protect a little piece over here that was probably never going to be under threat anyway and we'll call it an offset. So we can go ahead with destroying the environment here because we've bought an offset somewhere else over there.' That's not protection of nature. That is handing the fate of our precious environment over to the market when we should be protecting the environment from the ravages of big corporations. I heard the previous speaker say that the government has got a comprehensive agenda that involves responding to the previous Samuel review that said there are many holes in our environment laws. I agree. But the first bill that the government brings in isn't to close those holes. It isn't to implement the Samuel review—and there are lots of good bits about that and some bits that need to be thought about further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government doesn't rush in here and say, 'We've got to put in place legislation to protect the environment.' No—they bring this in instead. Where did this idea come from? It didn't come from the groups who've said, 'We've got to stop destroying our environment if we want to make sure we've got places not only for animals and wildlife, but if we want to protect our country for our kids and our grandkids, because we know that one of the best ways of tackling climate change is to stop chopping down trees—let the trees stay where they are.' The government doesn't come in and say, 'We're going to do that.' The government scrapes around for ideas from someone else. In this case, they picked up this idea from the coalition. The government beat its chest when it came in here and said, 'The coalition should support it because it was their idea.' My goodness, Labor! You're in government. You've got a Senate with which you could pass strong action to protect the environment and the climate, and what do you do? You pick up an idea that the coalition chucked around when they were last in government. The last coalition government does not have a pretty record when it comes to protecting our environment. Why would you want to copy them? Why would you want to come in here and boast, 'We've picked up an idea and a bill that were previously floated by some of the very same people that just got turfed out by the Australian people at the election'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You know the government is not serious about protecting the environment because they won't even follow the advice that has been presented to them. The last government—as I said, a terrible government for the environment and the climate—hid a very key report. They sat on it. They didn't want to release the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the environment </span>report. Why? It's because the report said the No. 1 threat to our environment is climate change. The minister rightly released that report and rightly pointed out the fact that the previous government was trying to hide it because they weren't interested in taking action on climate. We know that the biggest threat to Australia's environment—to our precious places, our biodiversity and our wildlife—is climate change. So you would think that the first piece of environmental protection legislation that the government would want to bring in would tackle that and say, 'We need to close the gaping loophole in Australia's environment laws that says you don't have to take into account climate change when the minister decides whether to approve a project.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just think about that for a moment. Climate change is the biggest threat to Australia's environment, and our environment laws are meant to protect the environment, but the environment laws don't need you to take climate change into account. Perhaps that's why this minister is approving new coal and gas projects when we know that coal and gas are the main cause of the climate crisis. This minister and this government are backing projects that will destroy our environment. If you were serious, you would do what everyone who wants to protect our environment has called for, and that is to put what's called a climate trigger into our environment laws. That is how you protect our environment. That is how you protect nature. You say, 'You can't keep opening up coal and gas projects in the middle of a climate crisis.' You can't do things that will make the climate crisis worse, because that will fast track the extinction crisis that we're in and will also fast track climate collapse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's not doing that. The government's not saying that they want to stop projects that are going to make climate change worse. They're coming in here, instead, and saying, 'Let's let developers and others make a buck, even as we continue to destroy our environment, as long as they don't buy some offsets somewhere else.' If the government were serious about protecting Australia's environment they would put a climate trigger into our environment laws, and that should be their first order of business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know who else used to think that a climate trigger was a good idea, as well as the scientists, as well as all of the groups who are fighting to protect the environment, as well as the Greens? The Prime Minister. When he was in opposition, he introduced a bill to insert a climate trigger into our environment laws. He made a very eloquent speech and said that one of the biggest problems in Australia's environment laws is that you don't have to take into account climate change, which leads ministers to start approving projects like coal and gas projects that will make it worse. It was the Prime Minister who came into this place years ago and said it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's even more true now. The fix that's needed to our environment laws to protect nature is not to hand it over further to developers, like Labor wants to do, and let them buy their way out of the destruction of this bit of environment because you're protecting another bit over there that was probably never under threat anyway; it's to stop opening new coal and gas projects. That is what we need to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN Secretary-General, the International Energy Agency, the world's scientists and our Pacific island neighbours have all said, 'If Australia keeps opening coal and gas projects we will fast track climate collapse.' There can be no new coal and gas projects opened if we're to meet even the government's net zero by 2050 targets. That's what the conservative International Energy Agency is saying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the safeguard debate, the Greens managed to stop about half of the 116 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline or the equivalent thereof. But we know that Labor wants to open the rest. Labor is out, at the moment, in Western Australia and Queensland saying that they want to keep opening new gas projects. In the Northern Territory, we're seeing the Middle Arm project proceed with public money. That's public money at a time that they say they can't find a bit of extra money to fund some more affordable housing in the country and fund the rent freeze. They can find $1½ million though to fund the Middle Arm project in the Northern Territory. Down in Victoria, they're wanting to go ahead and drill near the 12 Apostles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When everyone is telling us the best thing you can do to stop the climate crisis and the threat to the environment is stop opening coal and gas, Labor wants to keep opening more. This bill, that attempts to allow developers and others to make some money out of some offsets, that allows the destruction of the environment to continue, does not put in place the protections that are needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government were serious, and if the government wanted to do more than just be a pale imitation of the opposition, they would stop picking up the bills that were discarded from Liberals and Nationals when they were in government and start legislating to protect the environment. They would not say the answer is a green Wall Street, when we all know what happens when stock markets crash. They would say the answer to protecting nature is not to open it up to the speculators. The answer to protecting nature is to do what we do when it comes to protecting people and put in place protections in law. Just as we wouldn't say we're going to leave the minimum wage up to the market or we're going to leave the standard of aged care up to the market, we shouldn't leave protection of the environment up to the market either, because that means those with the most money win. And the environment loses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is the time for strong protections in law to stop opening new coal and gas projects, because that is the single biggest and most effective thing that we can do to stop the climate collapse and protect Australia's environment and biodiversity.</span>

I remember speaking to a girlfriend who's a passionate economist. I complained about how we don't value our environment enough and that we have progressed at the expense of our planet. She pointed out that what it really means is that the economists haven't priced the externalities correctly. In many ways, this bill is doing exactly that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market Bill creates a framework for a voluntary national market that delivers improved biodiversity outcomes through tradeable certificates. They're generated by landowners engaging in projects that embrace or protect biodiversity. I'm particularly excited by the potential for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to engage in this market, using the knowledge of their land embedded in their culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market Bill, in some ways, reminds me of the creation of a carbon trading market, which we had done under a former Labor government. In fact, this new bill will be overseen by the same regulator. From humble beginnings carbon markets are now worth over $1.3 trillion and they are the primary driver of emissions reductions in the world and are part of the world's largest shares in the EU.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's amusing that the Leader of the Greens is comfortable with carbon markets but not on nature repair bill markets. The truth is, the way that I like to think about it is, our national parks are like our minimum wage policy, but what this bill does is add value to what we're doing in the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has set an ambitious target to protect 30 per cent of Australia's land and seas by 2030. This commitment reflects the recognition of the urgent need to preserve and safeguard the nation's natural ecosystem. By aiming to conserve such a significant portion of Australia's territory, the government demonstrates its dedication to ensuring the long-term health and resilience of our unique landscapes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Achieving this goal will involve expanding and establishing national parks, conservation reserves and marine protected areas, while actively engaging with Indigenous communities and environmental organisations. This is something the Albanese government has already been doing. Today, in question time in this place, the minister for the environment discussed how the Albanese government has tripled the size of the Macquarie Island Marine Park.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government's commitment to align with the 30 per cent UN target adopted through the Convention on Biological Diversity and other geological initiatives to conserve and restore nature, sets an example for other nations. Through this ambitious endeavour, the Albanese government aims to foster a sustainable and harmonious coexistence between humans and our environment to preserve Australia's remarkable ecosystems for our children and grandchildren.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's more than just maintaining or mandating existing ecosystems. The conflict at the heart of conservation policy is a natural desire to hold matters of the environment as separate from world markets and economic development. This is not the world that we live in. Land is often touched by economic development, and we need smart ways to think about how we repair this land. Australia has some of the best regulations of reserves and national parks of any country in the world, but it's not enough. It isn't enough to deal with the crisis of habitat loss in Australia, it isn't enough to deal with the looming crisis of species extinctions of our unique wildlife, and it isn't enough to address the climate crisis, which, as we know, is affected by the destruction of complex and diverse carbon sinks. To properly protect our environment, we need to properly price the positive economic externalities that biodiversity gifts us, to incentivise the conservation of biodiversity on privately owned land and native title land. This requires putting a value on biodiversity and nature. This is an essential part of unlocking capital investment in conservation projects. We have international examples such as REDD+, the UN program to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries. Currently, this covers over 1.35 billion hectares of forest area in countries collectively responsible for 75 per cent of forest under threat of deforestation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in Kambalda, a nickel-mining town, and one of the interesting things about growing up in that mining town is that, as students, we recognised that the land needed to be rehabilitated, and so one of the things that we would do was to go out to an old mine and then plant seeds and basically watch that land be rehabilitated. The truth is that we were also paid in cash, which helped pay for school camp. It was an example of a market and a way that we could repair the earth. So the truth is that it's been proven that we can unleash financial markets to incentivise conservation and thereby find innovative ways to monitor and conserve our lands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a great example of conservation from WA. A Western Australian Aboriginal owned business called Marlee Djinda recently won grants from the department of infrastructure's Emerging Aviation Technology Partnerships Program. Basically, it aimed to promote Australia's unmanned aviation industry, also known as drones. A lot of Australian drone technology specialises in flying beyond line of sight in remote locations. With the support of this technology grant, Marlee Djinda have acquired cutting-edge spectral imaging systems and are now global leaders in integrating these capabilities. Marlee Djinda was formed to provide advanced drones and data services for Landcare projects. This enabled First Nations land corporations to access some of the most advanced airborne sensor technology in the world to assist with the conservation of biodiversity in country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Marlee Djinda has several case studies directly applicable to the proposed nature repair market. One case involved the use of range sensors fitted to a long-range drone shell designed and manufactured in WA by a company called Innovaero. They basically mapped out the Ngaanyatjarra Council lands in the Kanpa community as part of a pilot land management program. The drone sensors were able to pick up signs of contamination from old mining exploration and detect invasive species and their density, as well as mapping areas of cultural significance that local elders have an interest in monitoring. Following on from the opening part of my speech, the images were stunning, and it's really important that we think about how we preserve that for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example of their work is happening near Esperance, which is in the member for O'Connor's seat. I had the pleasure of spending time with the member for O'Connor yesterday when we welcomed students from John Paul College—my old high school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Out near Esperance, the Tjaltjraak Aboriginal Corporation's lands, Marlee Djinda has been using drones to monitor and control a highly invasive species called African boxthorn. It has done this by identifying its signature from the sky, both as mature plants but also as regrowth. This gives rangers a heads up when it's best to apply control methods and when they should work more efficiently. In partnership with Dr David Blake from Edith Cowan University, Marlee Djinda have recently taken up the crucial mission of addressing buyer diversity challenges in WA's Walpole-Nornalup National Park. This collaborative effort aims to protect the region's vulnerable peatlands, which are greatly impacted by climate change. Despite only accounting for three per cent of the world's terrestrial surface, peatlands store more carbon than any other ecosystem found on land, including in rainforests. By their leveraging technologies and capabilities, Marlee Djinda are working with other research and data collaborators to safeguard species that are critical to the healthy functioning of the Walpole peatlands. This focus extends beyond mitigating rising temperatures by also striving to shield these crucial species from uncontrolled bushfires and damage from feral pigs. I was so pleased to hear the member for Lyne's contribution to this debate and that he supports the removal of feral animals from wilderness and agricultural areas. I hope to see his support for this measure in the future, to use the amazing technological approaches we have available to remove harmful feral animals in Western Australia. Best of all would be to support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through their work, Marlee Djinda is part of a group of collaborators, Aboriginal and land councils, dedicated to preserving biodiversity in WA. Drone technologies, paired with existing programs like Aboriginal ranger programs and financial incentives using the proposed nature repair bill, will help to empower Indigenous landowners to manage country, and will generate culturally sensitive economic development in some of the most remote and economically deprived communities in WA. This is an environmental program, but this program will also provide great opportunities to close the gap through environment led economic development. This means, potentially, better health outcomes for Aboriginal people in remote towns, more job opportunities and more hands-on land to help manage the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other reason why it's really important that we protect biodiversity is because often we think that scientists have all the answers when it comes to our world's problems. The truth is that nature is really complex and has existed for tens of thousands of years. Often, the answers we're looking for in our modern life today are found in nature. That's whether it relates to medicines, aerodynamics or efficiency. So it's important that we protect it, not just for future generations but also for knowledge and scientific endeavour. If this bill unlocks even a fraction of the estimated $137 billion in potential finance available for investment in conservation between now and 2050, then it will have had a truly transformational impact on our nation by helping ranger programs, farmers and landholders to maintain our incredible and unique biodiverse Australian land.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  More than 60 per cent of Australia's total wine production is exported. Until recently, the Chinese market represented 30 per cent of the industry's total $3 billion in export sales. As we know, the value of wine exports to China has declined sharply. More than 95 per cent of wine destined for China was red wine, which represents 50 per cent of Australia's total red wine export sales by value. The sudden and dramatic loss of this market has resulted in a severe red grape and wine oversupply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Barker produces more wine by value and volume than any other in the House. It's home to some of the oldest vines and most acclaimed wineries in the country. Indeed, Riddoch Coonawarra's 2021 'the pastoralist' was recently awarded the international cabernet sauvignon trophy at the International Wine Challenge. But it's the Riverland that produces the most of our wine by volume. The Riverland is the oldest irrigation settlement in Australia. Coupled with a warm climate, this creates favourable conditions for growing grapes and producing wine. It's the largest Australian wine region by size, covering a whopping 20,000 hectares of grapevines spread along 330 kilometres of the river in South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Riverland's almost 1,000 growers represent almost one-third of our nation's total crush. As a result, this region is disproportionately impacted by the loss of the China market. In addition to oversupply, the region has been impacted by recent floods, and many irrigators, of course, are grappling with Labor's energy crisis. It's the perfect storm for Riverland winegrowers. One grower contacted me recently. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For many irrigators, the power increases coupled with the disastrous outlook for red wine grapes for the 2023 vintage (plus a flood event impacting on some irrigated properties) … might be nearly enough to send some … "out the back door".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Grapegrowers in the Riverland need our support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke about this need for support in November last year. I urged the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to act, to support the industry in what we knew was going to be an extremely tough vintage for 2023. Even before we knew the extent of the floods or just how high prices would go—that is, electricity prices—we knew that, without the Chinese market and with storage limitations, red wine grapegrowers would be in dire straits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote to the federal and state agriculture ministers in September last year requesting meetings with growers to discuss the potential for government support, but sadly I got crickets. The state government eventually allocated $100,000 for the industry to develop a blueprint to guide the industry future. And while I'm certainly not discouraging the need for a long-term strategy, that's cold comfort for those who need support today, particularly when the industry was asked at the same time to cough up $50,000 to support the development of the blueprint. But that sums Labor up, doesn't it? Somehow it always costs more. The industry came looking for help, and they left with an invoice. Some growers have been encouraged to mothball and some encouraged to rip out their vines and replace them with white groups, but both options come at a financial loss to the grower. For some growers it's simply not a crisis they can ride out, and I'm disappointed to hear that banks are getting nervous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of action from this Labor government to support this absolutely vital regional industry is gobsmacking. I can't imagine what the future holds for the Riverland community with those opposite intent on killing communities by taking productive water out of the market with buybacks—although many irrigators can't afford to pump it anyway, because of Labor's cost-of-energy crisis—and with the 2023 vintage running at a loss for many growers, they probably can't hang on. I know I've painted a grim picture, but this is a picture the minister needs to see. Irrigators in the Riverland are the lifeblood of that community. They are at the heart of the Riverland economy, and they're on their knees. We need a minister who is prepared to come and listen to them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I grew up in public housing. Labor governments gave my family a fair go. Public housing gave my migrant family a safe place to call home. But our housing agenda is not about me being a houso or the PM being a houso; it's about ensuring that, no matter where you come from—if you're in your 20s or 30s; if you're a teacher, a nurse, an early educator, an aged-care worker, an ambo or a police man or woman; or if you're a new migrant—you get a fair go and that you have access to affordable homes, the baseline which allows Australians to fulfil their potential. That is why the Labor government is committed to such an ambitious housing agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some facts. In the budget just past, policies which will be delivered are as follows. From 1 July we are significantly expanding the Home Guarantee Scheme eligibility so that friends, siblings and other family members will now be eligible to jointly apply in addition to couples and single applicants to help more Australians own their own home. We're also delivering support to renters with the largest increase to Commonwealth rent assistance in over 30 years and policies to improve the supply of rental homes. This will help over 1,000,000 Australians with the rising cost of rent. We've reached a national housing accord with a shared ambition to build one million new well-located homes. We are investing $350 million for 10,000 affordable rental homes, and we will work with the states to build on our commitment to deliver up to 20,000 new affordable homes in total. We've broadened the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, enabling up to $575 million to be invested in social and affordable rental homes. Also an additional $2 billion in financing will be available for social and affordable renting housing by increasing the guaranteed liabilities of Housing Australia. We're supporting build-to-rent accommodation. There's also expanded funding for homelessness services, with an additional $67.5 million for states and territories to tackle homelessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to all these policies already being implemented, the government's $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund represents the most significant investment in social and affordable housing by a federal government in more than a decade. The legislation is awaiting passage in the other place. I call on senators to support the passage of the bill because the housing fund will support vulnerable and marginalised community groups, women and children fleeing domestic violence, veterans, older women on low incomes at risk of homelessness and Indigenous communities in remote areas. But of course the Liberals, led by Peter Dutton, oppose the fund and the Greens are planning to vote with the Liberals in the Senate to block it. This is not dissimilar to Greens councillors who have blocked housing measures in local governments across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this government and our investments in social and affordable homes for Australians will actually change lives for the better, like they did for me and like they did for the PM. We also understand that the issue of housing is compounded by cost-of-living pressures, including energy prices. That's why this government is providing $14.6 billion in the budget for cost-of-living relief to support Australians, including up to $3 billion in electricity bill relief to shield over five million households and one million small businesses from rising electricity prices. We are helping households manage costs through energy relief rebates of up to $500. Retail electricity price increases in 2023-24 are now expected to be around 25 per cent lower, and retail gas prices increases are now expected to be around 16 per cent lower due to the government's energy interventions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Incredibly, the Liberal and National parties oppose this price relief. Despite opposition to energy relief for struggling Australians and small business, despite the opposition to more affordable rental homes and support for more Australians to own their own home—despite all this opposition and obstruction—the Albanese government continues to get on with the job of cleaning up the mess left by the former Liberal government and push through the political grandstanding of the Greens. Why? That's an important question. It's because we are committed to supporting more Australians with affordable homes that will give them that foundation to fulfil their potential in life and make their contribution. We are committed to supporting Australians by providing relief and the need for that relief from cost-of-living pressures which they're facing today. That's what this government is about. That's what we're committed to doing. Despite all the opposition from the crossbenches and the opposition, we are committed to making Australians' lives better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  They say Sunday's child is full of grace. In Elizabeth Shaw's case this is certainly true. On 5 January 1997—a Sunday—a little blonde bundle came into the world and, by her very nature from the outset, brought much joy. For her parents, Kylie and Stephen Shaw of Wagga Wagga, the arrival of Elizabeth, a sister to Zachary, was a happy and welcome occasion. Stephen is the eldest brother of my wife, Catherine, Elizabeth is my niece. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'm about to relay to the House is personal, but it's a story that needs telling and a cause well worth supporting. Elizabeth was raised in a supportive and loving family and taught she could do and be anything she wanted to strive for. She was a high achiever at school. She danced and was talented musically. She had a go at sport and, in her final year, was college captain, a distinction her younger sisters, Olivia and Gabrielle, also attained. As a teenager, like her three siblings, Elizabeth completed the arduous Kokoda Track—no easy task.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I tell you all of this because I want to paint a picture of what Lizzie's childhood and adolescent years were like—normal, fun, happy, successful, typifying a girl growing up in country Australia. Liz is now 26 and a new mum, and someone who should be enjoying some of the happiest days of her young life. Whilst she would be the very last person to seek sympathy—and I had to talk her into allowing me to give this speech—she now finds herself away from her beloved newborn and in a Sydney hospital, literally fighting for her life. You see, Elizabeth was diagnosed with aplastic anaemia, a rare bone marrow failure syndrome. This diagnosis came, like a sledgehammer blow, late in her pregnancy, with treatment starting seven weeks after she and her partner, Tom Byrnes, welcomed son Max into their lives.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Some of you might have noticed that the reply has only included a synopsis on Max's health and not my own. This is because I have not been well.</span>

So please consider donating blood or plasma, or even register to be a bone marrow donor. You will be saving lives. I wish you all the best, Elizabeth. We all love you.</span>

                  <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:43</span>):  I would like to say how moving that speech was by the member for Riverina. I send my regards to his niece, Elizabeth. I know there are many people in this parliament who would resonate with his speech, particularly the member for Kooyong and the member for Kennedy, who have been very strong promoters of bone marrow registries for bone marrow donations. So I thank the member for Riverina for his speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very fortunate to represent a community that has such a strong commitment to bettering the lives of those around them. Today I would like to mention one example of this selfless work, the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation. Since 2000, the Kids of Macarthur has served our region and helped raise crucial funds that go towards the purchase of critical paediatric medical equipment to enhance the level of children's health care in our local hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently had the honour of attending the Kids of Macarthur ball with my wife, Sharon, and a number of my colleagues from the healthcare and political world, including the New South Wales Minister for Health, Ryan Park; the member for Campbelltown, Greg Warren MP; the member for Macquarie Fields and minister for numerous portfolios Anoulack Chanthivong MP; and the previous member for Macquarie Fields and fellow paediatrician, Dr Andrew McDonald; as well as my paediatric colleagues Dr Raymond Chin and Professor John Whitehall and many others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Park made a very welcome announcement that the New South Wales government was pledging $30,000 towards the Kids of Macarthur to fund this year's pledge item, a retinal camera, which is a neonatal retinal scanner that will ensure less risk and greater comfort for premature and underweight newborns as they undergo vital vision testing and treatment for visual problems. Securing this piece of equipment at Campbelltown Hospital will allow children to be treated locally without having to be treated at the Children's Hospital and will eliminate the costs and stress of travel for families. This is why local advocacy by a local group such as Kids of Macarthur is so important for our communities. It's put together by those who know well the area and its needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to particularly thank Denise McGrath, the Chief Executive Officer of Kids of Macarthur, for her selfless work above and beyond any possible thanks we could give her. She works tirelessly to raise funds and raise awareness of paediatric issues and needs in our community, and we are very, very grateful for her hard work. I have known Denise for a number of decades. She is a tireless campaigner for local children and their healthcare needs, and I thank her for her hard work. Denise is committed to Macarthur and has no hesitation in giving much of her time and skills without charge to better our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank the board of directors of Kids of Macarthur, particularly its chair, Bruce Hanrahan AM, of Dignan and Hanrahan Solicitors, for their valuable work in ensuring the charity continues to thrive. I would also like to particularly mention my very good friend the late Dr Rick Dunstan OAM, who we sadly lost in 2022. This was the first Kids of Macarthur ball we had without Rick. We worked together for over 35 years, and Rick had the original idea to raise funds and awareness to obtain the very best equipment for our local paediatric services. I'm proud to see that, through his vision and Denise and other's tireless efforts, Kids of Macarthur continues to be a shining light on the hill for sick children, their families, our community and our health practitioners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another important group of people that we need to thank too, and that's the volunteers who contribute to Campbelltown Hospital and Kids of Macarthur. This year, Gail Kelly was named Volunteer of the Year for the wonderful efforts she put in in providing toys, beanies, mittens and socks and other handcrafts to the children in our hospital, as well as the gift hampers that are used for fundraising purposes at Kids of Macarthur events. I've seen firsthand the importance of this work in providing support for our local children and our local hospitals, and I want to make sure that it continues, and I commit to supporting Kids of Macarthur well into the future. They make a difference for our kids in hospital, for our kids who are suffering from terrible illnesses like leukaemia and other blood cancers, solid cancers, heart failure and a whole range of other severe illnesses that, unfortunately, inflict themselves on our local children. I see it as my job to promote this wonderful charity and the efforts it makes to promote the health care of our children.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:48</span>):  Recently I gave the commemorative address at the Penrith city sub-branch of the Australian National Servicemen's Association. With this year marking 50 years since Australia's participation in the Vietnam War was formally declared ended by the then Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, it was particularly poignant. I came across the words of a poem <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tour</span> by a serviceman, Paul Zaat. I would like to read the first and last verses:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those in my community who fought in Vietnam: thank you for being so brave, for putting your commitment to serve our country above anything else. Fifteen thousand nashos served: 1,200 were injured and 200 made the greatest sacrifice. That included Errol Noack, the very first servicemen to be killed in Vietnam. He was 21 years old and just 10 days into his service. 'I don't want to go to war, but I must obey the call to duty; I will go and do my best,' he said. Our youngest and most strong and dedicated were called upon to serve their country in a conflict that was far from our shores. They had great courage and resilience, and they demonstrated their bravery and determination in the face of great adversity. They showed the world what it means to be an Australian: to stand up for what is right; to fight for freedom and democracy; and to serve our country with honour and distinction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The war had a profound impact on Australia, both in terms of its military and its society. This was not the first time we had sent troops to fight in a foreign conflict not directly related to the defence of our nation. Today, 50 years on, the scars of that battle, the divisive reaction at home and abroad and the challenges of readjusting to everyday life are still carried by many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An anniversary of 50 years is a time of reflection and remembrance for all who were affected by this conflict. We remember the sacrifices made by our troops and their families. We remember their courage and determination. And we honour their service and sacrifice, not just on this day but every day—and we also must continue to learn from it. In the world today, when we're experiencing such global uncertainty in a way that many of us haven't experienced before, there's a sense of comfort in reflecting on the strength of those who fought under our flag in Vietnam to protect our nation, and on the wisdom of their experience. I call on young people today to learn from the collective experience of those who have served—we must not forget. I also call on them to be inspired; their sense of honour and duty is an inspiration to us all. The poem continues:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, to leave this god forsaken place, the excitement could be seen on everyone's face.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We had served our "country" as requested, we fought and toiled and never rested.</span>
              </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299962" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DOYLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:53</span>):  For the first time in my role as the federal member for Aston, I was honoured to be part of a recent citizenship ceremony held in the performing arts centre at Rowville Secondary College. I would like to take this opportunity now to congratulate these proud new members of our community on receiving their Australian citizenship and welcome them officially to our country—and, indeed, to the electorate of Aston.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mayor of Knox City Council, Marcia Timmers-Leitch, presided over the ceremony, welcoming our 251 newest Australian citizens. We had a moving welcome-to-country ceremony conducted by Uncle Ringo Terrick. I wish to acknowledge my friend and colleague the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Hon. Andrew Giles, and thank him for visiting my electorate for that special occasion. Isn't it wonderful to have a minister who understands the immigration system, who wants to see our citizenship grow and who cares about multicultural communities?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last year, over 173,000 people became Australian citizens by conferral, a huge increase on the year before. This was only possible because of the work of the Albanese government. The Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon. Clare O'Neil, has been doing the work to bring Australia's migration system back on track after nine years of the previous Liberal government's dysfunction. These are real people in Australian society, not to be used for fearmongering and dog-whistling purposes by the current Leader of the Opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community of Aston is vibrant, it is strengthened by multiculturalism, and we are proud of our diversity. We are home to the world's oldest continuous cultures as well as Australians who identify with more than 300 ancestries and who speak more than 400 languages, including First Nations languages. Around one-third of the local community in Aston were born overseas and speak a language other than English at home. From every culture, every race, every faith and every nation, migrants make an enormous contribution to Australia in so many ways. It's what makes our country such a great place to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When people from other countries make the decision to migrate to Australia, it is often for reasons such as building a better life for themselves and their families, and I am sure they don't expect to be treated any differently to Australian citizens. Imagine, then, their shock when finding work here and then discovering they're being paid way less than other workers alongside them or are being treated unfairly because they're migrant workers. I'm proud to be part of a government that isn't afraid to crack down on dodgy business practices that exploit migrant workers. After a decade of neglect under the Liberals, the Albanese Labor government is taking steps to ensure migrant workers enjoy fair wages and conditions. For example, I was recently paid a visit by a delegation of workers in my office here in Canberra, and one of those workers, who was from WA, told me that a large company pays its migrant workers a rate of $27 a day. Whether it's a four-, six-, eight- or even 16-hour day, they get paid. $27 for a day's work. How is that fair?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To quote Minister Giles:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is a crisis of exploitation, with up to one in six recent migrants paid less than the minimum wage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When migrant workers are being underpaid—it hurts all of us, driving wages and conditions down for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the coming weeks, I will welcome the introduction into parliament of Minister Giles's legislation that will deal with unscrupulous employers and their exploitative practices. The Albanese government is also committed to supporting exploited workers who speak out. The government will consult with business, unions and civil society on whistleblower protections for temporary visa holders and on strengthening the firewall between the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Department of Home Affairs, because migrant workers deserve a fair go too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's vision is for a targeted, simpler migration system that serves our national interests and helps migrants thrive in our society and economy.

What better way to show how much we as a country value their contribution than having these unfair work practices that target migrant workers stamped out?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:30</span>):  Kooyong, it's time we finally build the Box Hill to Hawthorn safe cycling corridor. Imagine riding your bike along a car feed trail from your home in Kew to your school in Camberwell, to Surrey Hills and to the city for work, to ride or walk in calm and safety from Balwyn to Canterbury to Swinburne University in record time. For years, our community has been crying out for governments to build the final nine kilometre stretch of the path connecting the suburbs with the main Yarra trail and the anniversary trails. More than 20 schools and other educational institutions will be served by the Box Hill to Hawthorn cycling trail. It will be used by thousands. It will bolster businesses, cut emissions and save transport costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't just listen to me; listen to my community. Suet Mon Wong from Surrey Hills, who currently rides her children to Canterbury Primary School, said that the trail will 'provide a safe journey to school, to shops and links to explore other bike trails'. Kate Prest of Camberwell told me, 'Both of my children risk their lives to ride to school. Building this trail will provide an enormous uplift in wellbeing to many school-aged children and their parents.' Greg Heminway of Kew points out that 'off-road riding is far safer with substantially lower probability of collisions'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I had the opportunity to meet with several groups of interested cyclists from my community, and we discussed how we can inspire local, state and federal governments to work together to finally get this bike path built. They are all raring to go, with good reason. The trail has already been subjected to a Victorian Department of Transport feasibility study and was designated a strategic cycling corridor in 2019. Of course, any decision on infrastructure funding must be merits based, but we believe—we know—that this is a project with a whole lot of merit. I'm really looking forward to working with my community groups and with local representatives from all levels of government in Kooyong to make the case for finally building the Box Hill to Hawthorn trail.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:32</span>):  I'm proud to stand here today to talk about the recent changes to Sky Muster because finally residents of McEwen, who were let down by the previous government and left without cable internet, are getting better NBN services. Since 1 June, these people have been able to use uncapped satellite broadband services for the first time. The new Sky Muster Plus Premium service will provide almost 4,500 customers in McEwen with unmetered data 24 hours a day and with fastest speeds of up to 100 megabits per second. In our communities, we will finally be able to access fast, reliable and affordable broadband no matter where we live. It is a game changer for regional communities let down by nine years of the conservative government, because having access to fast and reliable internet has never been more important in this increasingly interconnected world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to belong to an Albanese government that is providing the NBN and ensuring communities like ours are not left behind. The unmetered service is being enabled by this government's $480 million investment to upgrade NBN fixed-wireless services that are moving around 120,000 premises from satellite to fixed wireless, freeing up capacity on Sky Muster. This complements the commitment we made at the election to improve broadband technologies in regional areas. We also invested a whopping $2.4 billion to expand full-fibre NBN to an additional 1.5 million premises; 660,000 of those will be in regional areas. We are delivering on our election commitment, something the other lot never did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the former coalition government, residents in McEwen on Sky Muster were capped, the data was limited, and it was limited to when you could actually have access to it. There was even a restriction that those forced to be on Sky Muster were limited to only downloading 55 gigabytes per month, and that was downloading between 7 am and 1 am. Even in the face of the pandemic, when more people were working from home and staying home to keep our community safe, no changes were made to support them. High-speed broadband communication services are not just expected to be provided by a competent government but are essential for people to engage in work and in education in this day and age. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's another example of where the Liberals and Nationals failed the communities of McEwen. We have been paying for a service that we have not been getting for years now, but finally under the Albanese Labor government we are delivering for residents in McEwen. We are no longer getting the coalition's second-rate service where we were paying more and receiving less than inner-city counterparts. We finally have communications infrastructure that residents of McEwen not only need but rightfully deserve, particularly as we have been 100 per cent into the former government's line about having regional areas with major road transport in disaster areas, but where they failed to deliver anything more than 1½ towers in nine years of coalition madness. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:35</span>):  I rise today to shine a light on a fantastic community based charity, Whitsunday Foodbank. We all know that Aussies are doing it tough, families are tightening their belts and the cost of living is going through the roof. Outside the Canberra bubble we see every day how the cost of living is nipping at the heels of thousands of Australian families. With interest rates continuing to climb and electricity and gas bills skyrocketing, for many families the cost of groceries is becoming unaffordable. Aussies are proud people. They work hard, but, through no fault of their own, they are drowning in these costs and are now reaching out for a helping hand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's where an incredible local organisation comes in, an organisation that I want to give a big shout-out to, Whitsunday Foodbank. In recent weeks I attended the opening of the new Whitsunday Foodbank branches, in Mackay and Proserpine. Providing a hand-up, not a handout is Whitsunday Foodbank's motto, empowering our most vulnerable people to purchase their own groceries, offering them good-quality food at a more affordable price. And with more Aussies forced to turn to organisations like food banks than ever before, their role in our community has never been so important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor's created cost-of-living crisis, the Australian way of life is fast coming a nightmare. In Dawson many families are forking out up to $1,100 more each month to pay their mortgage. A staple item like a loaf of bread is now over $4 for most brands, and it is easy to find some of our major brands of cereal at over $10 a box. The cost of necessary items like personal hygiene or feminine hygiene product are starting to become unaffordable. It is for this reason that I am so grateful to the team at Whitsunday Foodbank who offer the most essential products at discounted prices—for example, a box of milk for a gold coin. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whitsunday Foodbank is available to pensioners, concession cardholders and healthcare cardholders. For food banks to offer this incredibly important service they need donations and volunteer support, so whether it be funds, food or volunteers, all donations are greatly appreciated. As we know, volunteers are the backbone of our communities, and I want to say a huge thank you to all the Whitsunday Foodbank volunteers who give their precious time to help our most vulnerable. To Jeff and Judy Boyle and family and to Christine and Vicky and all the volunteers and support crew, I say thank you for providing such an important service to Dawson. Your hard work and dedication do not go unnoticed. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MURPHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:38</span>):  Today I want to talk about the power of community sport. Sport is a lot more than medals at the Commonwealth Games or the Olympics or the World Championships. It is a lot more than the footy on Friday night or professional athletes. It is about connection and support and a place to belong. I think that is very aptly demonstrated by the experience of Shevonne from Mount Eliza. I recently saw Shevonne playing netball on a Saturday morning at Frankston &amp; District Netball Association's pink day, which was raising funds for the Breast Cancer Network Australia. She was playing in mums versus kids event, and Miranda, the general manager of the Frankston &amp; District Netball Association, said, 'You should hear Shevonne's story, it's pretty great.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shevonne and her husband emigrated to Australia from the UK a few years ago. Newly arrived, unfamiliar environment, three kids, including twins, and a husband working in the city, Shevonne found herself suffering from post-natal depression. It was pretty tough. She was lonely and isolated. She had no friends, no family and three young kids. Shevonne was looking for some sort of connection, and she came across the Frankston &amp; District Netball Association. Out of the blue, she rang the office to ask, 'Is there somewhere I can play?' She wasn't a netballer. Luckily for her, her phone call was picked up by Raeleen Darcy, who's a legend. Raeleen supported her, encouraged her and said: 'There's a Facebook page. Post in there and see if anybody can pick you up for a team.' Shevonne didn't know anyone. How was she going to look after her kids? How was she going to be involved? FDNA have a program where they look after your children while you play netball so that mums can get involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shevonne talks about Rae being an aunty figure because of the support she gave her. She speaks really fondly about the women from the other teams, the FDNA staff and the umpires who helped drive her passion for the game. Knowing that she hadn't really played much netball, the umpires helped to provide words of encouragement and supportive advice. I didn't know she'd never played netball before—or hadn't played it until recently—when I saw her play. She's really picked it up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her message is really simple: getting involved in community sport has changed her life. Getting involved in sport helped her physical and mental health. It helped her make friends. She now has four kids and is an active member of the FDNA family. Her daughter has joined the netball team and does some coaching of NetSetGo. Shevonne has her own team—apparently she's going to get into the finals this season—and has community and belonging. That's what sport can bring to people and communities, and I hope people get some encouragement from a story like Shevonne's.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:41</span>):  I am honoured to represent a electorate that has a rich Chinese heritage—in fact, it's the third-largest in all of the seats in the House of Representatives. Many of us go through the logistics of getting schoolchildren to school five days a week, but many of the Chinese residents in my electorate send their children to school on weekends as well. I had the honour of visiting many of those schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first was the Chinese Language School, which is hosted at Blackburn High School. It's led by Principal Ken Su. The school has grown to 300 students in just over six years, and I saw them, from all age groups, working hard on a weekend. I then went to the Formosa Chinese School in Doncaster East and spoke with Principal Mariana Liou. There is not only an academic focus at the Formosa Chinese School but a values focus as well, on the students caring for each other and being good people and good citizens. Given its strong reputation, the school has grown from 90 to over 300 student. That's obviously a credit to the principal and all of the teachers and volunteers. I was also struck by all of the parents who were there making sandwiches and food for the kids in the break. I also joined in a dragon boat festival and was proud to have come second in a race at the school. We should have come first!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Chinese Fellowship Chinese School was the third school that I went to. That has three campuses, and the one in my electorate meets at Templestowe College. It seeks to promote friendship and social development through Chinese language education. Ms Yali Shao is the principal and has spent over 30 years teaching and establishing this institution along with my friend Philip Cui, who has privately contributed to many of the resources. Both of their efforts, and their dedication to teaching, are inspiring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I still have two schools to meet: the New Chinese Language and Culture School and the New Century School, which is hosted at Doncaster Secondary College. I want to thank each of those who contribute to these schools and the teachers who put in that effort. They teach during the week and then they come and give up their time to do this on the weekend. It goes without saying that without the generous support of the parents and volunteers, and private support, none of this would be possible. It says to me that we should be very proud of our Chinese community because their hard work and dedication to improving themselves and their children is really inspiring, and it's the sort of thing that brings our country forward. I was really proud to visit those five schools and look forward to visiting the other two. We can all agree that the value of education cannot be overstated, and you can never have too much education. We should always be proud of being Australian but also proud of where we came from, and that's exactly what these schools do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:44</span>):  In what has become a yearly tradition, on Easter Monday I took part in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Catalpa</span> memorial event organised by the Australian Irish Heritage Association at the beautiful <span style="font-style:italic;">Catalpa</span> Wild Geese Memorial in Rockingham. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Catalpa</span> story recalls events of nearly 150 years ago and remains an inspiring tale of Irish courage and rebellion. In the 1860s many Fenians were being arrested by the British as they fought for Irish independence, and they were shipped off to Western Australia, to the awful Fremantle Prison. The 'wild geese' included six prisoners who would later escape that prison, make their way to Rockingham Beach and row out to the now legendary <span style="font-style:italic;">Catalpa</span> whaling bark, in which this escape, sponsored by US supporters of the Irish Fenians, took place. At the memorial event, I got to participate and use my limited acting skills to narrate for a play that portrayed the scene of the stand-off between the <span style="font-style:italic;">Catalpa </span>and the armed British steamer the SS <span style="font-style:italic;">Georgette </span>which took place off the coast of Garden Island. I want to thank Stephen Pratt MLC for representing the Western Australian government at this event. It was his first time at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Catalpa </span>memorial event, and I'm sure he enjoyed it. This was the first time a festival accompanied the memorial, and it was a great success. I want to thank Laurie and Nola Smith and the remarkable Rotary Club of Palm Beach and all of their volunteers for helping put this festival together. I also want to thank the Tourism Rockingham association, who also helped organise the Catalpa Adventure Festival. They are one of the 26 deserving community organisations in the electorate of Brand who will receive between $2,000 and $5,000 as part of the government's Volunteer Grants program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we all know, volunteer organisations are the lifeblood of every community. Their unwavering commitment and hard work, especially during these past few years as we've dealt with COVID and the after-effects, inspire us all. Over $62,000 has been awarded to successful community groups in the Rockingham and Kwinana area. Eight grants will go to community centres and community support groups, including Coastal District Care, the Frank Konecny Community Centre and the Mandogalup Volunteer Bush Fire Brigade. Three of the successful grants were provided to early years and education support services. They include Youth on Fire WA, Honeywood Primary School P&amp;C and Kwinana Early Years Services. Ten of the successful grants were provided to sporting and recreational community groups, which are so important across Rockingham and Kwinana. They include the Kwinana Bowling Club, the Kwinana Tigers Hockey Club—thanks for the hoodie!—Surf Beach Boardriders, Athletic Rockingham Football Club, Baldivis Basketball Club, Rockingham Mandurah District Cricket Club, Cycling without Age Rockingham, who do a terrific job, Rockingham Hornets Cricket Club, Peel Junior Cricket Association and White Knights Baldivis Cricket Club. These grants are designed to help community organisations support the important work of their volunteers, and I can't wait to see the progress they each make with these grants.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:47</span>):  I would like to bring to the attention of the chamber three extraordinary La Trobe residents who have been awarded Medals of the Order of Australia. The first is Julie Cini, of Spinal Muscular Atrophy Australia. Ms Cini co-founded Spinal Muscular Atrophy Australia and has served it, first as the president and now as the chief executive officer, for the past 18 years. Ms Cini's two children, Montanna and Zarlee, both tragically lost their battle with this disease in the first year of their lives. During this period, Ms Cini also dealt with the loss of her partner. Despite these personal tragedies, she went on to found SMA Australia just six weeks after Montanna's passing. I cannot think of anyone more deserving of a national honour than Ms Cini, who has helped countless families for almost two decades. I commend her selfless service to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second is Robert Millen, awarded for services to the Scouts. Mr Millen has served in Scouts leadership positions since, incredibly, 1964, rising to his current role as chair of the Australian Scout Fellowship's Gilwell Park heritage branch in 2013. As we all know, Gilwell Park is the home of Scouting. As a former Queen's Scout, I again thank Mr Millen for all the great service he has done, especially for Gilwell Park—and, might I add, under the previous government $5 million was awarded to Gilwell Park to make it again state of the art.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third is Sharon Reynolds, awarded for services to pistol shooting. Mrs Reynolds has been involved in pistol shooting for more than 40 years and currently holds several senior positions in Australian and international organisations. She has also spent more than 20 years as a competitive judge for the Olympics and Commonwealth Games and has given this sport such incredible service and devotion. I'm glad to see that Mrs Reynolds has been recognised for her decades of service to pistol shooting, from local club leadership to her work on the highest international level of sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All these great Australians have done incredible work in the La Trobe community. I again thank them for their service, for their dedication and for making Australia great. To receive the order of Australia is something they can be very proud of. Very few people get to receive this award. Again, on behalf of all residents of La Trobe and all people of Australia, we congratulate them.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SITOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:50</span>):  Over the past few weeks, I've had the privilege of visiting some amazing aged-care facilities in my electorate. As soon as I walked into Redleaf Manor Aged Care centre in Concord, I felt at ease. It felt like home. That's because of the staff, many of whom had been working there for decades. For them, aged care wasn't just a job; it was a calling. It gave them purpose: to care for our older Australians. The Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mark Butler, and I were able to go thank the staff there and tell them about the $11.3 billion commitment the Labor government has made to fund a 15 per cent increase to their award wage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many aged-care workers who live in my electorate—almost 1,000 age and disability carers—and more than 30 aged-care facilities are located there. What unites every one of those workers is their care for older Australians in their final years. It's a demanding but vital role. But they deserve more than thanks. We ought to value them and pay them accordingly. Finally, they have a government doing just that—one that is truly on their side in trying to provide the best possible care to older Australians. Contrast this to the former government, whose own royal commission described it as doing as little as it could get away with on aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is making a historic $36 billion investment into aged care. It demonstrates the ambition we have for the sector, and that ambition is borne out most clearly by how quickly and urgently this government is addressing the royal commission's recommendations. We've implemented 69 of 148 recommendations in the first 12 months of this government. Compare this to the efforts of those opposite. They could only get around to implementing nine recommendations in 15 months. I commend the Minister for Aged Care, Anika Wells, for the work she is putting into reforming the sector. We are determined to ensure older people, who helped build this country, receive high-quality and safe care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I got to meet Sue, an aged-care resident, at Chiswick Manor Care Community. She's a former PE teacher and had organised for residents at the centre to raise funds for MS research. As a collective, they have raised $1,200 and walked a total of 278 kilometres. Sue should be a reminder, to all of us in this place, of the enormous contribution our aged-care residents have made to this country and continue to make. They deserve the best care we can give them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:53</span>):  A number of Fisher residents were recognised in the King's Birthday 2023 Honours List for their work to make the world a better place, and I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge them: Mrs Judith Bandidt OAM, of Palmwoods, for her service to the community of Goomeri; Ms Glenda Lloyd OAM, of Meriden Plains, for her service to children and to the community—she's been a foster parent to more than 100 children—Ms Vanessa Aland ACM, of Golden Beach, for distinguished services in corrections; Mr Raymond Mogg ESM, of Aroona, for distinguished services to emergency services, most notably the coast guard at Mooloolaba; and Mr and Mrs Edward and Linda Vann for their services to the community of Maleny. I also want to pay tribute to the late Dr Michael Simpson OAM of Montville, whose OAM for services to the community of Montville acknowledges his tireless work as a GP in the local area. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With Dr Michael's passing, there are now no longer any more doctors practicing in Montville. It's incredibly important for the community of Montville that we be able to continue some form of doctors' services. I want to pay tribute to Natalie and the Montville Pharmacy team, Michael and the Montville Village Association, and Shiralee at the Montville Chamber of Commerce for their advocacy on this important issue. Together, the Montville community has taken a petition calling on the government and the parliament to make it easier for a doctor to practice in Montville—775 people signed the petition. That may not seem like a lot of people, when you think about all the different petitions that are put before this place, but Montville is a very small community in my electorate. It misses out, by being around 200 metres from a line that was drawn on a map in relation to the Modified Monash Model, on funding to attract doctors to work in Montville. Just down the road, only a few kilometres away, we have the town of Maleny. It's much more lucrative for a doctor to work in Maleny under this model. Montville only just misses out, so I'm calling upon the Minister for Health and Aged Care to make an exemption for the people of Montville, which is a very old community. The roads are quite treacherous between Montville and Maleny. </span>

                  <a href="140590" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'NEIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:56</span>):  In discussion with my community, there is one matter that is coming forth again and again as the most urgent and important. Whether it's parents at my kids' school, people who I run into in the supermarket or families who contact me via email, it is absolutely clear that the cost of living is what is of most concern around kitchen tables in my electorate at the moment. That is why the first and the second and the third priority of the Albanese government is helping Australian families manage what is a really difficult situation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're about a month on since the budget, and I think a lot of my constituents would have heard me say that we had an unprecedented $14.6 billion package, which is assisting Australian families with the cost of living, at the same time that the Treasurer, for the first time in 15 years, is going to be able to deliver a budget surplus. That's a really important combination of things there: a balanced budget that's really good for our economy and for slowing down inflation but also this big cost-of-living package that will assist families in my community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The amount of $14.6 billion is almost an unimaginable amount of money. I want to speak a bit today about what this really means for the families in my electorate. For Hotham locals it's going to mean a lot. For 6,500 families in my community, it will mean cheaper child care. That means that parents, particularly mums, in my community will have more flexibility both in their family budgets and also in the decisions they make about staying home or taking on a bit of additional work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I visited an early education facility in my electorate, in Clayton, and met Kashmira, who runs the centre there, an amazingly charismatic person who is doing this absolutely brilliant job in raising and assisting to support the early education of many young people in Hotham. What she said to me is, 'These cheaper childcare reforms will ensure that early education and care is more affordable for more local families.' It's already starting to show in her centre, where more parents are getting that great opportunity to make sure that their kids are getting support in those early years of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hotham locals are also going to benefit from the Energy Price Relief Plan. Steve from Oakleigh contacted me about energy bills, which is a major issue facing a lot of people in my community. We've been able to limit the worst of the energy price spikes while investing in cheaper, cleaner energy, but it's absolutely true that energy bills are still far too high. The budget is going to make sure that Steve is going to get up to $500 off his energy costs, thanks to the Albanese Labor budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to mention Lily from Clayton South, who has contacted me about the expense of going to the GP. The budget had the biggest investment in bulk-billing that we have seen since the beginning of Medicare—a huge achievement and something that will be of great benefit to my community. To Hotham locals: I completely hear you. This is a really difficult time for a lot of families in my electorate. Every day, I come to this parliament and try to make sure we are doing as much as we can to assist you with this really burning problem.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  The Australian Defence Force budget is an important measure of its ability to fulfil its role, and there can be nothing more important than ensuring that the men and women who serve our nation in the ADF have the resources they need to do their jobs to fight and win our wars. But we know that, under Labor, defence always suffers. Defence spending is always lower under Labor, and this budget is no exception. No, this is not political spin—the very gifted minds at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute have been crunching the numbers since the budget was delivered a month ago. They have identified that defence funding over the forward estimates period is lower than in the March 2022 budget of the former coalition government. In fact, this year's budget provides $1.5 billion less to defence over the next three years than our budget in March last year. This was confirmed by defence officials in estimates two weeks ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget papers reveal a cut to Army and a cut to Navy. It's disappointing but, unfortunately, not surprising. It makes it harder for our people on the ground, at sea or in the air to do their jobs, and there are already very specific examples of that. Cuts are being felt at the coalface right now. I know I've spoken about this a lot, but I want to raise again the cut to the order of the infantry fighting vehicles from 450 to 129 under LAND 400 phase 3. The reason I bring it up again is today I am hoping the minister opposite will take the opportunity to answer questions that are on the minds of every member of a mechanised battalion across the country, and particularly at the 3rd Brigade in my electorate: what is the future of our mechanised battalion? Which ones are going to be stripped of their capability? Which ones are going to have years and years of training and preparation go completely to waste? Which ones will see a raft of discharges as people feel their jobs mean nothing anymore at a time when we need all of our people? And specifically, on behalf of my own electorate, why won't the minister come clean about the future of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, and other Townsville units that use the infantry fighting vehicle?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is hurting our people right now. I was at 3RAR the day before Anzac Day, when the Deputy Prime Minister—that part-time defence minister—made this announcement. There were Kapyong Day commemorations, and it wasn't long after the ceremony finished that I was receiving messages like this: 'Why is the minister denying the infantry soldiers and those in a combined arms environment the protection that they deserve? So much time invested into capability we cannot use. So many discharges because we have lost our identity.' Even the Chief of Army says that infantry fighting vehicles are needed to help our troops survive. Why won't this part-time defence minister listen to soldiers on the ground and listen to the Chief of Army?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government knew this decision was so unpopular, they didn't even reference it in the budget papers. The government are so inconsistent when it comes to defence. They say they'll do one thing and they'll do something completely different. I'm sure the minister remembers the Prime Minister's interview with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> where he said that he would spend whatever was necessary to build a defence force that could defend Australia, but here today we're talking about a $1.5 billion cut to the defence budget. So why is the Prime Minister breaking his promise and making it harder for the ADF to keep our country safe? It's a question which didn't get a decent answer when the member for Canning asked him in question time and an answer which I don't expect to receive. But I hope that this part-time defence minister will give the men and women who serve our nation in uniform the common decency of a response to the above questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I could venture briefly into the veteran space for a moment, the former service men and women who I speak to on a daily basis have become pretty sick of the politicisation of the portfolio under this new minister, who, clearly, doesn't want to be the veterans' affairs minister. So my final question is: when will this government stop playing politics and deliver for our defence members and our veterans?</span>

Underpinning this have been difficult but real funding decisions, which have seen $7.8 billion of spending being reprioritised over the course of the next four years and a growth in the defence budget of 0.2 per cent of GDP above what we inherited from those opposite, over the course of the next decade. We are making the difficult but necessary decisions. We're making substantial, funded announcements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When those opposite were in government and faced with a problem in defence, their solution was to make an announcement, but without any actual money behind it: $42 billion of unfunded defence announcements, which put an intense pressure on the Department of Defence to take action but with no actual money to take that action. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence Strategic Review </span>and as exposed through Senate estimates, we learnt that the former government regarded the defence budget as their piggybank—a piggybank that they were very happy to raid, with the effective outcome of a significant cut in defence spending: some $20 billion of effective cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same can be said for how the previous government treated the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and I'm proud that, after almost a decade of chronic under-resourcing and underfunding, the Albanese Labor government has now turned that around. We have invested in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, placing it in the best position it has been in in three decades. So Australians can have no doubt that supporting defence personnel, veterans and families is a key priority for the Albanese Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In September of last year, the claims backlog that we inherited was still on an upward trajectory and had hit 45,000 DVA claims. At the end of May, we had got that down to just over 34,000—that's a 23 per cent drop from its peak, and it is continuing to fall. We are spending $322.3 million, as set out in the last two Labor budgets, to employ and retain additional staff at the Department of Veterans' Affairs to get through those claims. We've budgeted $341.1 million to fund the modernisation and sustainment of the IT systems within DVA to support the processing of those claims. We've budgeted $46.7 million to fund the delivery of 10 veterans and families hubs in the areas where we have the highest concentration of veterans around the country. And we're rolling out a $24 million Veterans' Employment Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, unlike when we came into government, over 90 per cent—in fact, nearly 100 per cent—of invoices for in-home support for veterans and families are being processed within 20 days. That had blown out to over three months for most invoices when we came into government. We now have that under control. And we have increased the annual TPI payment by $1,000, to support some 27,000 of our most injured veterans. The Defence, Veterans' and Families' Acute Support Package was introduced by this government, expanded across the spectrum of veterans, and in the budget last month we expanded that to also include grandcarer veteran families. We've improved access to mental health supports. We're providing better access to GPs by tripling the veterans access payment. And we've now acted on all 13 recommendations of the interim report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">
                    </span>Of course, we have also been building on our support for our Defence Force personnel. The legacy that we inherited after almost a decade of the Liberal Party was an ADF workforce over 10 years that only grew by just over 2,000 people despite the very real need to grow the size of our Defence Force. I say to the member for Herbert, who clearly does not understand anything to do with strategic imperatives let alone the content of the Defence Strategic Review, I think all of the members of the Defence Force in his electorate as well as around the country can have great confidence in their ongoing purpose and their ongoing role in our Defence Force. I am very clear that they have an ongoing purpose, an ongoing role and will continue to have that, because we are continuing to fund the purchase of infantry fighting vehicles but in a reprioritised manner and that is really important. Of course, what is important is that our Defence Force is able to do what is needed in the strategic circumstances that we face. If you want to not politicise the veterans' affairs budget, you would support housing for homeless veterans. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOWARTH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry. He is not here but maybe the assistant minister or the Minister for Defence Personnel can answer. Earlier this year, on February 28, the Minister for Defence, Richard Marles MP, stated: 'In order to develop a strong, sovereign and internationally competitive Australian defence industrial base, we will need to leverage our collaboration with our close partners and likeminded countries.' But over these past few months, I have spent time visiting people in defence industry right around Australia, in Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and in New South Wales. There are lots of great companies exporting some of what they make overseas to other defence forces but are finding it difficult to get orders here, so, sadly, they have been left to hang out to dry by this Labor government, with many telling me that they are not getting any orders and that, in fact, there have been no new orders from this government since they came to office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my question to the minister is: Where are the orders to sustain and develop this sovereign defence industry base that your minister spoke about and that you promised? Around AUKUS, where are the orders for the next five years? How are these defence industry companies around AUKUS in the next five years going to be fed? You are contributing to that by not putting one extra dollar in the forward estimates. Why are you not putting any new money into the next four years? You keep going on about the next 10 years. Well, that is great in years 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 if you are still in government but what about these next four years? If we are facing such a sense of urgency as stated in the DSR on page 17, 'Strategically we have already entered a decisive period for the Indo Pacific,' why are we not putting any new money in?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister continues to stand behind the microphone and deliver false hope by using sovereign capability as a buzzword, but when exactly will the minister step up and start to support Australian defence industry with orders instead of dishing out empty words, which results in empty bank accounts? Can the minister outline what orders the government has placed that directly support Australian industry? In case you need to be more specific, if you look up '155 millimetre munitions', over one million of those have been fired off in the Ukraine war resulting in a worldwide shortage. Can the minister confirm how many 155 millimetre munitions Australia has in stock currently. How many have we got? And if you don't know, why not? Can the minister confirm that the government has ordered Australian manufactured 155 millimetre munitions in the last 12 months during this worldwide shortage? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the minister tries to hide behind a bureaucratic process of CASG, let's go there. What is the minister doing to get CASG to place orders with Australian businesses manufacturing here? What has Minister Conroy done in the last 13 months to get CASG to order from Australian companies—not what you have told the department but three tangible things that you have done to bring change to CASG and, in turn, tangible change to defence industry? Unless the minister is driving these changes, it will be the same old, same old. Our defence industry in this nation can no longer continue to hold on waiting to be fed. So tell me, Minister, how many people within CASG have two levels of experience where they are ex-defence but are also working in defence industry? It's not one or the other but both, and, if you don't know, why don't you know? The Australian defence industries deserve better than what this government is giving them. They deserve more than ministers who say one thing but continue to kick key decisions down the road and deliver only review after review.</span>

                    </a>  Perhaps the Assistant Minister for Defence or the Minister for Defence Personnel could answer those questions to the Minister for Defence Industry. To the Minister for Defence Personnel: the Australian Defence Force and the men and women who serve within it deserve the full and unrelenting support of your government and the whole parliament. So let's talk about Navy recruiting figures in the last 12 months. Information recently provided to me reveals that whilst the Navy has recruited 1,100 new recruits, we've lost 1,500—can the minister confirm that is correct?—and that the Navy now faces negative personnel attrition of 400 in the last 12 months alone. Minister, we want to see you do well in this area. We want to see more people, men and women, joining the ADF. Everyone on this side, on the opposition, wants to see you succeed. So maybe you can outline a little bit about what you're doing in that space as well.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence, Assistant Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Assistant Minister for the Republic</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  Regarding the member for Petrie's questions about the defence industrial base and the industry asking questions regarding contracts, there's a simple answer to those questions. That is because the previous government cancelled the Attack class submarine project. That was the big defence project that industry was gearing up to deliver. The contracts had been signed, the work in France had begun on construction of the submarine and industry here was gearing up to partner with defence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On my first visit to Osborne shipyards in this role, I visited the facility that was built by industry in partnership with government to construct the Attack class submarines here in Australia, a purpose built, beautiful facility. Guess what's happening with that facility at the moment? There's plenty of work for industry. Industry is involved in taking it down—in deconstructing it—because of the previous government's cancellation of that project. Again, those opposite are all talk. They were big on announcement, but when it came to delivery the previous government were woefully inadequate in the defence space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, of course, in the wake of that, they announced the AUKUS arrangement to build nuclear propelled submarines here in Australia. That was supported by the then Albanese opposition, and since we have come to government we have been delivering on that commitment. The optimal pathway has been announced, in conjunction with the United Kingdom and United States governments, and the government is getting on with delivering that. That will revolutionise Australia's defence industrial base. There will be much work that the Australian defence industry will be partnering with the government to deliver, creating 20,000 new jobs in the Australian economy—a project akin to the Snowy Mountains scheme in terms of its scale and its development for Australia's economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not true that there aren't contracts that the defence industry is undertaking at the moment with the Australian Defence Force. I've visited a couple of projects in my role, most notably the Ghost Bat technology that's being developed in a partnership between Boeing Australia and the RAAF to build uncrewed reconnaissance and surveillance vehicles. They are being constructed here, in Melbourne—Australian jobs for Australians. This has massive export potential for our nation. It's an Australian technology in the defence space that has big ramifications internationally as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I was in Randwick, where OCIUS, a small to medium-sized enterprise based in my electorate, handed over to the Royal Australian Navy their fifth BlueBottle vessel. This is wonderful innovative technology that uses solar power and wave power to propel, again, an uncrewed reconnaissance vessel. It's doing wonderful work off the coast of Australia for the Australian Navy and for Australian Border Force. This is Australian technology promoting Australian jobs in partnership with Australian universities in the renewable energy space, delivering for the people of Australia and the Australian Defence Force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to AUKUS, we've announced some new projects to ensure that we speed up the development of partnership with industry. The Advanced Strategic Capabilities Accelerator that was announced recently by the government will ensure that that partnership with industry delivers those jobs and those investments in the near to longer term, and $3.4 billion has been allocated by the government over the next 10 years to ensure that that partnership prevails. That project begins on 1 July. Later this year, the Defence Industry Development Strategy will be released as well, and that will provide the pathway for the opportunities associated with AUKUS and the delivery of the recommendation in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence Strategic Review</span> where industry can partner with the Defence Force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the member for Petrie's claims are simply wrong. The new government is getting on with a partnership with defence industry, because we know that government can't deliver AUKUS alone. There needs to be a partnership with industry around Australian jobs, and that is what the Albanese government will deliver.</span>

In the 2022-23 budget, I noted that there was $12.21 billion, and in 2023-24, nearly $12.32 billion dollars. This is a vastly less amount—I think it's only about a 0.94 per cent increase—when we're up against seven per cent inflation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget was also bereft of information. We noted during the budget estimates that not only did Minister McAllister have to do an opening statement but the department secretary had to do a 10-minute following clarifying statement. What the statement confirmed was that the backlog of veterans' claims peaked at 45,226 in September last year. That's a record, and it happened under the Labor government. It's also got a legacy that the largest veterans' claims backlog in the history of Australia was presided over by Labor. The coalition will keep the pressure on Labor to get that backlog down to zero. We will be unrelenting in this task. We will pressure this government to continue the coalition's plans to bring on more staff to clear the backlog. We will pressure the government to honour the commitments to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, which was established by the coalition. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We note in Budget Paper No. 2, on page 92, it allocates $61.4 million in 2023-2024 for veterans' claims processing. We also note that the interim report of the royal commission confirmed that under the coalition government in 2021-2022 and 2022-23 DVA received increased funding to address the claims backlog. The royal commission noted on page 235 that the former government, the coalition government, committed $73.3 million over four years in supplementary funding—on top of what we did—for claims processing. The coalition supports the principle of consolidating the various acts that govern veterans' compensation, MRCA, DRCA and VA. But it is not a blank cheque. We will wait to see whether the results of the consultation are the visibility of a draft bill. Our concerns from Senate estimates are that we were given the impression that a draft would be put forward in the public domain for consultation, but that has been delayed. When the estimates panel was asked for a guarantee that there would be an exposure draft, they were told:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">An exposure draft would be a matter for government, and I think that in this case it's likely that they'd give that very serious consideration.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They'd better give it more than serious consideration because of the promise. The coalition is extremely concerned about the performance measures on Page 39 of the portfolio budget statements that relate to processing the income support compensation payments under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. Across the board the budget papers show that processing times got worst in Labor's first year in office. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to move to veterans hubs, and I know the member for Braddon will latch onto this. But Labor made a deliberate decision not to continue the funding for eight veterans hubs committed to under the coalition. I ask the minister to be clear about when these sites will be reassessed and what funding will be put on the table. Labor scrapped the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Labor scrapped Wagga Wagga region, Labor  scrapped Mackay region, Labor scrapped Wide Bay and Burnett, Labor scrapped the Sunshine Coast region, Labor scrapped the greater Melbourne region, Labor scrapped the Mornington Peninsula region, Labor scrapped the greater Sydney region. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some things that are very close to my heart are World War I's unmarked graves. I note this was a great program that the coalition were a part of for those who did it tough when they came home from World War I, which both my grandfathers served in only about a mile away from one another. I am very suspicious that there is only $201,000 for the program this year, which includes a carryover of $100,000. The government says it has committed $1.5 million across four years. Where is it? The coalition is suspicious of government efforts to pressure the War Memorial into rewriting history. We see that right now, and it is a disgrace. In the last few months we've seen that what was absolutely indelible in regard to the frontier wars not being represented at the War Memorial, because Australian soldiers did not serve in any frontier wars in that period of time, will now be put into the War Memorial, or there's a push towards it. This means they've found new history in merely months, after years and years of noted history. This is something I would like the minister to explain to us. What is the new information you have now that was never there before? </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  I commend the ministers on the serious way in which defence is treated in this budget. We're still waiting for the apology we asked for last year in this forum from the opposition for the disgraceful preelection scare campaigns that somehow the government could not be trusted on defence. We knew the campaign was getting really bonkers when they were running the line with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> that somehow the now Minister for Defence and Deputy Prime Minister was some kind of Chinese spy or Manchurian candidate—a great 48 hours of journalism! They ran a scare campaign that Labor would cut defence. Again, these budget papers, the second in the term of this government, prove that that was in fact untrue. We won't say 'a lie' in this forum, but that is what it was. Defence spending will rise to the highest in decades, two per cent of GDP rising another 10 per cent to about 2.2 per cent over the next 10 years. But most importantly it's not just dollars; it's injecting a sense of urgency into defence which was lacking in the previous decade of drift and dysfunction and decay and denial and devaluation and dithering and disgraceful non-delivery, distraction, deception, dilly-dallying in defence under the previous government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our strategic circumstances are the most serious since World War II. The comfortable planning assumption on which the country has been able to rely for decades, of a 10-year strategic warning time, has gone, and we need a hard-nosed Australian approach to deter conflict by increasing the lethality, resilience and readiness of the ADF. This budget sets out the first steps to give effect to the recommendations of the Defence Strategic Review. More than $270 billion of investment is confirmed in the Integrated Investment Plan. The acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines, critical for deterrence and protection of our maritime trade, is funded over the forward estimates. There is about $9 billion for AUKUS, of which the submarines are part. AUKUS is critical. It's a technology-sharing partnership with our closest allies. Frankly, it was overhyped but undersold by the former government. Running around with dozens of Australian flags did not actually explain to the Australian people the importance and the seriousness of the AUKUS partnership. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are developing the ability to precisely strike targets at longer range and, importantly, manufacturing munitions—bullets and missiles—in this country. One of the key lessons from the Ukrainian conflict is the need to be able to manufacture and maintain the consumables of war and maintain your platforms with sovereign capability. We are improving the ADF's ability to operate from northern Australia, after a decade of the coalition doing nothing. Interestingly, back when Stephen Smith was the defence minister and Sir Angus Houston was running the defence forces, in the forward planning there were plans to upgrade the northern bases. But, under the decade of dysfunction of those opposite, those plans disappeared, leaving us a decade behind where we should be in terms of allowing those northern and western bases to be forward operating bases should the contingencies materialise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Growth and retention of a skilled workforce—on this one I have to acknowledge that the economy is no friend of the defence forces. The fact is that the situation we've inherited has seen us going backwards in net terms this year again, by 900 personnel, rather than the net gain of 1,000 which we need to meet the increase of 18½ thousand personnel over the next decade or two. Interestingly, that was unfunded under the previous government. They had $42 billion of defence projects, including the expansion of the ADF, for which there were press releases, announcements and Australian flags, but there was no actual funding. As the Deputy Prime Minister rightly reminds the House regularly, you can't go into battle waving a press release or waving the budget papers or waving a flag—'Stop! I've got a flag! I've got a press release! I've announced this new capability!' You actually have to fund it and to deliver it. It's not even the funding, of course; billions of dollars of projects were simply not delivered. They were announced. They were running late. There were 28 projects running 97 years late—covered up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget has a new technology and industry initiative, with $3.4 billion over 10 years for the Advanced Strategic Capabilities Accelerator for supply chain resilience. Importantly, it also commits us to deepening diplomacy and defence partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region. Australia is an island, but we're not alone. Rightly, DFAT, Foreign Affairs, should take the lead in setting national strategy, and Defence should bring to bear its capabilities for deterrence or, if the worst happens, for conflict, in support of that national strategy. But that does rely on tough decisions being made about priorities. This government is a complete contrast with the rabble opposite.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  It would appear that the government has no plans for any new veterans hubs, as was alluded to by Mr Joyce earlier. Two of the completed hubs recently announced were fully funded by the former coalition government, in Tasmania and South-East Queensland. The one that I will speak of most passionately is the north-west veterans hub, in the north-western part of Tasmania, which has been on the go for quite some time, and it has finally got its deed. Dr Andrew Clarke is the guy that heads that facility up—a former ammo tech, a bomb technician in the Army, a major, and now a GP on the north-west coast of Tasmania. He wants me to extend to the minister his thanks for finalising the deed—even though the minister probably took years of that doctor's life by stretching that process out. Nevertheless, it is up and running and it plays a pivotal role in the transition between the big family that is Defence and the new family which is civilian life. What I like about the north-west veterans hub—in fact, what I like about the veterans hub projects moreover is that they have a family-centric, positive, welfare-driven mandate as far as outcomes are concerned. They don't look over the shoulder, there is no time for pity parties. We expect our veterans to get up off the couch and do something for themselves, and we're there to stand by and support them in their new transition from military into civilian life and a way forward. I'm concerned, however, that there is no announcement of any future or subsequent veterans hubs from this government, and I'd like the minister to answer to that. I would also like him to answer why, in the home of the soldier at Kapooka in Wagga Wagga, there's no wellness centre or veterans hub. If anyone deserves a wellness centre or a veterans hub, I would have thought it would be the home of the soldier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018 the former coalition government introduced a program to maintain incapacity payments to veterans who were studying. The coalition improved the program to provide 100 per cent of veterans with pre-entry earnings for them to undertake full-time study as part of DVA approved rehabilitation plans. Without the coalition's 100 per cent subsidy, those payments would have phased out at 75 per cent over the 45 subsequent weeks. Not only has the 100 per cent subsidy gone but the entire program also is coming to an end. From 1 July, for all the veterans out there, it's over. What's the minister doing about this? I would request—in fact, our veteran community would like to see and to understand the minister's tabling of the analysis on which this decision was based. Additionally, the minister must explain what will happen to those veterans who are currently on courses and receiving the 100 per cent salary equivalent. What's going to happen to the courses? Where's their money going to come from? What does their future involve? Their future is unclear, and I would like the minister to clear that up for our veteran community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally and importantly, Labor's first budget last year slashed more than $2 million from a dedicated program to mark the private graves of First World War veterans—the unmarked graves. I've been to some of these gravesites throughout Tasmania, and there is a lovely lady by the name of Andrea Gerrard who is heading up this program. She is an older lady, an experienced and dedicated lady, who has put her heart and soul into this, and $2 million from this program has been removed. This means that the blackberry-overgrown, sunken depression that holds a digger who served his country in the First World War hasn't even got a tombstone on it. The coalition put $3.7 million in forward estimates into this project. Labor is funding $1.5 million. They can't put these gravestones on these unmarked graves without that funding. What is the minister doing about it? In 2023-24 there is just $201,000 allocated for the program, and I would like to pass on from Andrea Gerrard in Tasmania that she can't do it without that increased funding. I'd like the minister to explain to me, the veteran community and Australia why our World War I diggers don't deserve a tombstone. Goodness me!</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  When we consider Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2023-2024, we have looked closely at the defence portfolio—a portfolio that is no mean feat to cover within the space of a mere hour on the floor. I acknowledge the contributions made by my colleagues. I observed some of the remarks in this debate by the member for Herbert, and I would simply say that as a nation we are best served when both of the major parties of government can work together and have our nation's defence be bipartisan—for the sake of our strategic continuity as well as our reputation and our standing within our region, and with our friends and allies abroad. Hearing from both the Assistant Minister for Defence and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs really has demonstrated—as is so often the case—that we have a government with adults at the helm, one that is ready to make responsible choices to safeguard our national security, our national strategic interests, our sovereign capability to defend ourselves and preserve peace and order, and—I would argue the most important duty among that list—safeguarding those persons who have accepted the call to safeguard and those who have retired from that esteemed calling that one can undertake in their lifetime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence as a portfolio—for any that have read through even a fraction of those budget papers—is an extremely large umbrella, one which acts as both shield and sword for Australia's strategic interests, its sovereign capabilities and the preservation of regional stability. Forming spokes on the umbrella of the Defence portfolio are, of course, the Department of Defence and the ADF. Adjacent to them we also have the Australian Signals Directorate, ASD, who act as our nation's sword and shield—as their name suggests—with our signals intelligence and our cybersecurity operations. A well-funded ASD is a testament to a government that is cognisant of the fact that modern problems require modern solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another spoke on the Defence portfolio umbrella is Defence Housing Australia—an important part indeed. It's one that operates to ensure the other spokes are turning smoothly and one that ensures our Defence Force personnel have roofs over their heads for themselves and their families while they perform their duties in the service of our great nation. In fact, the Albanese Labor government committed to enacting lasting and meaningful reforms to defence housing as part of our election commitments and over the last year in the 47th parliament. There are so many examples of the Albanese government doing just that: manifesting election commitments as legislation and having them pass through the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One can, albeit naively, look at defence housing as mere shelter for our ADF personnel, but it's much more than that. This government improving the defence housing framework by introducing the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Amendment Bill last year is the proof in the pudding of this being the case. The Albanese Labor government introduced this legislation in part as a measure to retain many of our highly trained and highly skilled ADF personnel by amending the scheme eligibility criteria, making it significantly more attractive to stay in our nation's service in the face of lucrative private-sector employment opportunities. The defence housing is there, and especially so after the reforms introduced by the government that aim to assist our veteran population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That now brings us to the veterans affairs spoke of our Defence portfolio umbrella. I doubt a single member in this place would be shocked to know that protecting the interests and the wellbeing of our veteran population is something I'm extremely passionate about, not just because I'm a veteran myself but because I'm a member who represents over 6,000 veterans in my electorate of Spence, along with many of their families. These families can look towards a number of budget measures, some of which are moving forward from recommendations made in the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide. In fact, $64.1 million is being put towards better resourcing the DVA not just to keep up with increased numbers of claims but also to clear the backlog of claims. This backlog causes many veterans anguish and rusts on an increasingly jaded outlook towards a government department that is tasked with assisting with the delivery of a number of services that assist veterans and their families. This commitment of funds goes hand in hand with the $254.1 million that is being committed across four years towards the modernisation of the ICT systems at the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Bringing claims further away from manual handling and processing can finally bring the backlog of claims down, just like what the minister for immigration has diligently achieved after years of administrative gutting by those opposite when in government. Very few portfolios are immune, but I'm delighted to continue to see our government make continued inroads to put things back on track.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  This is a great opportunity to speak on a really important portfolio matter. There's nothing more important than the defence of our nation, and I thank the members for Herbert, Petrie, New England and Braddon for their contributions today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year we began hearing the right things out of the defence minister's office about our defence and about the strategic challenges we're facing as a country. The DSR was announced, and with it the promise of generational transformation in defence, defence industry and the ADF. That's what was held out to the Australian public. Last November, the Prime Minister gave an interview to the foreign editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>, Greg Sheridan, where he said that his government would spend whatever is necessary to produce an adequate Defence Force that could defend Australia. We were right to expect a lot from the DSR. There was a great buzz about it, about the step change and the conversion of Labor from defence cutters to defence spenders. I think it was a great thing to be hearing all those words. But, alas, the signs were not promising when we were told that the DSR was going to be announced on the eve of Anzac Day. There was a nice window there where the DSR could be announced, there would be no media and the whole thing would sink without a trace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The DSR has been a disappointment. There are more questions than answers. There are plenty of good things in the document. We welcome the clearer language about the threat and the strategic challenges that our country is facing. After all, it is rock cut from the same quarry as the former government used; with the DSU and the FSP of 2020, there is a lot of symmetry in those documents with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defenc</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e </span><span style="font-style:italic;">strategic review</span>. But the truth is there was no new money in the DSR. There was cost shifting and there was cannibalisation of capability, particularly of the Australian Army. The member for Herbert mentioned the cuts to the IFE program, going from 450 to 129. What that means in real terms for our soldiers is that they will go from three mechanised battalions to one mechanised battalions—a huge hit to morale and land combat power, which is essential for us to prevail in a close fight. We need to win not just the deep fight but also the close fight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, DFAT was the only department that got money out of the DSR, which I think is more telling about the internal machinations of the Albanese cabinet than the priorities of the minister. Even yesterday, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> newspaper, defence industry voiced their disappointment in the DSR, saying it was 'slow, unfounded and vague', so there's a lot of work to do. There are more reviews, and we still don't have a strategy; a defence strategy document won't be released until 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, all of this is really important because the elephant in the room, which we haven't talked about today, is AUKUS, and the clock is ticking. We have fewer than four years to get ready for the first submarine that will come from the US for Submarine Rotational Force-West. There is a whole series of bills that needs to come through both the House and Senate and pass into law to enable AUKUS. There has to be the uplift of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span> from a conventional place to a nuclear base. We need to establish all the supporting industry and workforce around the base and we've got fewer than four years to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to ask the minister: does he still take responsibility for his failure to deliver the adequate funding for the DSR as he said he would in October? What's he doing about recruitment and retention? We are still below recruitment levels. We are bleeding people from the Defence Force. What's he doing to keep them in the Defence Force? The assistant Minister talked about growing the workforce to 20,000 people. How is that going to happen? We've still got no detail about how that's going to happen. How are we going to get sovereign ready by the end of the decade—a crucial precondition for us to receive our first Virginia-class submarine?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to say I'm actually really worried about the state government in Western Australia. A couple of weeks ago, South Australian Premier Malinauskas gave a superb speech at the News Corp Defending Australia forum—probably one of the best speeches I've heard by a Labor figure on national security in the last decade. The member for Herbert was there. The member for Petrie was there. We all agreed it was an excellent speech. Here was someone who actually grasped the task ahead not just from a state perspective; he's leaving the parochialism of the pandemic behind him and actually thinking about this from the national interest perspective. Now that Mark McGowan has gone—and thankfully so, because he did nothing to advance all this, in fact running at cross-purposes to foreign policy and our national interest—the question I have for the minister is: what's he doing to motivate the new Premier of Western Australia, Roger Cook, to get AUKUS moving? We cannot fail at this first gate. If we don't hit the first gate and establish Submarine Rotational Force-West by 2027, the rest of AUKUS is in doubt. There's a lot of risk here, and I want to see some leadership from the minister on this question.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  The Albanese government is investing in Australia's defence and national security to keep Australians safe today and in the years to come. The Albanese government is committed to lifting defence funding above its current trajectory so it will be 0.2 per cent of GDP higher by 2032-33 than on the current projections that we inherited from the previous government. We inherited an unsustainable defence budget. The DSR identified multiple examples of the former government announcing initiatives without allocating additional funding to the Commonwealth budget to support them. We are delivering immediate actions through the initial reprioritisation of the Defence Integrated Investment Program. We will rebuild the IIP as part of our first national defence strategy, to be delivered next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to address some of the issues raised by the shadow minister for defence industry. I want to commend him for picking up my talking points from when I was the shadow minister for defence industry and for making all of the same criticisms of the lack of work in this area by the previous government that I used to make when I was the shadow minister. He talks about a concern about no sovereign capability, when the previous government thought sovereign capability meant making sure we spent money on Australian security guards, Australian hotels and Australian real estate agents to support our submarine program. That wasn't a capability for defence, but the previous government didn't understand that at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, yes, we have to clean up the legacy that we've been left when it comes to rebuilding sovereign capability in defence industry and across our Defence Force, and that's what we are getting on with doing. It's why we have had to reprioritise $7.8 billion across the forward estimates to make sure that our defence dollars are being spent in the most appropriate way to achieve the strategic outcomes that are required, as identified in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence strategic review</span>. Recruitment and retention are, of course, a key part of that. It's why in the last budget we announced a $50,000 continuation bonus to keep more people serving in our Defence Force. It's why we are moving to a new contract arrangement for recruitment. It's why, as part of that arrangement, we are moving from, at the moment, a 300-day recruitment time frame down to a 100-day time frame, and we are trying to reduce that even further so that we can get more people into the pipeline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the shadow minister for veterans affairs for his continued support of my role, unlike the member for Herbert in his contribution, which concerned me greatly; I'm deeply troubled. I thank him for his support. In particular, I thank him for his support in working with government, as we wish to work with all parties, on the veterans' legislation reform program. I completely understand his point that that's not a blank cheque, and that's why we will work collaboratively across the parties and with the veterans' sector to make sure that we get this reform right. But when it comes to the administered budget, that some $12 million that he referred to, that's, of course, demand driven. If more claims are processed and if people need more support, that money gets spent, and that's an important part of how that budget is acknowledged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The backlog is also important. The reason the backlog peaked in September is that we inherited such a problem that we had to recruit hundreds of additional staff. We started doing that. It takes months to train those staff. It takes a while to have that effect, and we're now having a downturn in that backlog. But let me be clear: the evidence to Senate estimates at the end of last year from the then secretary of the department was that, under the resourcing provided to DVA by the previous government, the backlog would never have been gotten through. So when it comes to processing times, of course a consequence of that blowout in the claims backlog under the previous government, which we are getting a hold of now, is that those claims take longer to process. That is what happens. That's why we're trying to get through this backlog. I'm glad to have support for doing that, and we are going to keep doing that.</span>
                </p>

                    </a>  And I was very happy to open it, because—the member makes a very good point—the one in Darwin was funded. The other ones you took to the election were not. We are rolling out eight additional hubs. We're very happy to fund that. We think that's a great program. We're working with other RSL branches and organisations on similar types of programs to move forward.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I point out something very important on unmarked graves? The reason there's less money is that we cut the internal administration cost in the department. The money is going out the door now, and we're very proud to be able to deliver that important program and support that. In the process, we've identified graves that are going to get full commemorations, because that's what they deserve. We're happy to be delivering on all of these measures.</span>

The sector contributes $354 billion to Australia's gross domestic product of $2.4 trillion, which is just under 15 per cent, while providing high-paying jobs to more than 250,000 Australians directly employed by the sector. Many of these jobs are in remote or regional parts of the country.

To reach net-zero emissions by 2050, we will need more mining, not less. The mobile phones we use each and every day contain nickel mined in Kambalda and refined in my electorate, in Kwinana, and electric and hybrid vehicles on Australian roads contain lithium and rare earth elements mined in WA and across the nation.</span>

Following a decade of inaction by those opposite, this government's second budget provides the leadership, investment and policy certainty that this sector needs to thrive. The government is developing its future gas strategy, recognising the important role of gas in supporting Australia's energy transformation. The strategy will ensure that future gas supply meets expected domestic and international demand by drawing on engagement with states and territories and existing analysis.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're investing $12 million to review the environmental management regime for offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage activities. We're ensuring Australia's regulatory frameworks are fit for purpose and deliver regulatory certainty for investors. We'll ensure that our regulatory architecture is world class and that First Nations Australians are properly consulted on decisions that impact them and their lands. The government is investing $4.5 million to develop a road map for establishing a decommissioning industry in Australia so that we can recycle, reuse and dispose of materials here. The road map will add a clear vision on which to build a world-class decommissioning industry in Australia, which means new jobs and investment in regional areas. We have a multibillion-dollar opportunity to establish an onshore decommissioning industry for offshore oil and gas infrastructure to service demand in Australia and the Asia-Pacific, and we will not waste that opportunity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget includes $14.3 million to partner with the Queensland government, supporting research and development to reduce emissions in Australia's energy resources sector. Those opposite buried their heads in the sand over climate change, embarrassing Australia on the national stage and creating unacceptable uncertainty across the resources sector. The fact is that the oil and gas sector committed to net zero long before the Australian government did so. The industry is already investing billions of dollars in deploying renewables, electrification, methane abatement technologies and carbon capture and storage, and this government will play its part in supporting the sustained research and development of these low emissions technologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has enshrined our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 into legislation, and we will meet that commitment with the resources sector. As I've said before, the road to net zero runs through the Australian resources sector. Our extraordinary endowment of critical minerals and rare earth elements will be essential to creating our new resources economy. That's why the government has committed $80.5 million to developing the sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Budget funding includes $57 million for the establishment of the Critical Minerals International Partnership program, which steps up our international engagement, attracts investment from like-minded partners and accelerates projects of strategic importance. This measure will build on the government's effort to connect with allies to build resilience supply chains and move into downstream processing. Over the last 12 months, the government has taken this engagement seriously, delivering a Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact with the US; a critical minerals investment partnership with India and a partnership with Japan; a US led Minerals Security Partnership alongside Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, the EU, the UK and Sweden; and a Sustainable Critical Minerals Alliance alongside Canada, the UK, France, Germany and the US. The government has invested $23 million to extend the operation of the Critical Minerals Office, ensuring we can keep coordinating, optimising and prioritising activities across the government to support Australia's critical minerals sector. This budget will continue to support the Australian resources sector and its enduring contribution to the energy transition, global security and national prosperity.</span>

One year on, Labor have been all words and no action when it comes to supporting manufacturers. They are all excuses and no solutions when it comes to addressing the pressures industries face each and every day. Labor are all spin and no sincerity. With flawed policies, they continue to rush through without proper industry consultation. It has been one year since the election of the Albanese government and their policy scorecard remains woefully empty on the industry portfolio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After promising the world to Australia's industrial sector before the election, the Albanese government has given our manufacturers an atlas in this budget. Manufacturers are still in limbo, dealing with rising costs, soaring inflation and the Albanese government's go-slow on manufacturing. Worse still, the budget has cut critical programs that Aussie industries have come to know and were utilising to their benefit. Politically motivated reviews cost our manufacturers time they simply do not have. Each lost moment puts them behind their international competitors. Like a bad sequel, the modern manufacturing initiative delay saga continues with endless reviews, which even ABC Fact Check have said were not needed. By the assistant minister's own admission, these reviews have added three to four months delay to critical defence, food and space projects as part of the MMI collaboration stream, with many projects yet to be funded. So, Minister, will you now provide a concrete time line for these businesses? When will they receive the money they were promised? Will you provide an ironclad guarantee that these outstanding grants will be honoured by the end of this financial year? And will you apologise to these businesses for the uncertainty you have created?</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The successful Entrepreneurs' Program was also cut in the budget. In this government's ham-fisted attempt to insource industry expertise to the Public Service, the measure will instead cost 200 existing industry experts their jobs, as we learned in Senate estimates. Again, we see the tell-tale signs of a bad Labor government cut, with government websites noting that all applications submitted to the Entrepreneurs' Program prior to closure will be assessed and honoured if eligible. So, Minister, will you confirm that this commitment will be honoured without a lengthy three-to-four-month government intervention?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also learned from this budget Labor's war on the space sector continues, with whole programs cut after the government ripped out millions of dollars from programs in this critical sector that supports defence and agriculture outcomes, just to name a few. Minister, could you please outline how you believe it is reconcilable that the Prime Minister specifically named the space industry as a critical sector in opposition but, now in government, this budget has stripped sector of crucial funding yet again?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Mr Albanese announced his plan to create the National Reconstruction Fund as part of his opening speech at the 2021 ALP annual national conference, he made some bold promises. He promised that the NRF would support a nation that can stand on its own two feet. He promised that the NRF would see us export our Australian-made products to the world. He promised that we should not have to rely on other countries when it comes to protecting and providing for our people. Words are not enough. Well, one year on and, rather than standing on our own two feet, our manufacturers are up against the wall, suffering because of this government's failure to deliver on its key election commitments once again in this budget, commitments to bring down power prices and deal with the issues that our manufacturers need resolved. The only solution they offered to industry before the election was the NRF and they are yet to commit to a start date. So, Minister, when will the NRF fund its first project? Will you commit to genuine consultation with industry and not just with your union paymasters? Why have you still not seen fit to conduct inflationary modelling on this $15 billion off-budget funding vehicle?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy costs are spiralling and the only answer this government has given so far is to ruthlessly review and cut coalition programs that were working. One year on, and rather than standing on our own two feet, because of Labor's policies, Australia's copy paper industry has shut down. Because of Labor's policies, the cement industry is at risk of offshoring. Under Labor's watch, Australia's forestry industry is on life support, as they continue to be besieged by bad Labor policies. Under Labor's watch, more than a dozen large building companies have closed. This budget provides such little comfort for industry struggling with the cost of everything going up. </span>

                    </a>  No; there's genuine pleasure. It's right from here, and I will never miss the opportunity to talk about our plans, as we said when we went to the election, about a future made in Australia. We recognise that, post the pandemic, it was very important for us to learn the lessons of the pandemic—in particular, that the things that we were most concerned about as a nation and what we were expecting to be able to rely upon were there at the time we needed them the most. We know the impact of supply chains, particularly concentrated and broken ones. We know that we do need to build up capability. We know that geopolitically we cannot keep all our eggs in one basket in terms of relying upon where we source our products from and that we do, in key areas, need to build up. That's why, for example, we put forward the National Reconstruction Fund, where we target a number of priority areas. Based on CSIRO advice, we have shaped up those priority areas and we are focusing on delivering the development of manufacturing capability in those areas across resources, ag and medical science, in terms of energy, transport and defence, and we are also enabling capabilities, particularly in terms of critical technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all founded on the basis of what we think are those things that do confront the nation. We do have people who can help solve those problems. We need to be able to pair up the talent of our people with the resources that we have at our disposal and also make sure we have targeted capital available to be able to build up, through a co-investment fund of that nature, what we require. In terms of the budget itself, you saw advancements in terms of support for development following the passing by the parliament of the National Reconstruction Fund. It will support the set-up of the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation. Those funds were allocated. We also put about $500 million into science and industry to ensure that, in particular, we have stronger businesses creating more secure work and helping solve some of those problems we talked about but also, obviously, advancing human knowledge and applying that in a way that improves national wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've, frankly, reprioritised poorly designed and badly administered policies of the last government, and we want to be able to do that with some of the new programs we announced, not least of which being the Industry Growth Program. We do appreciate that there will be people who are affected by the decision in relation to the Entrepreneurs' Program. The reality is that we have a different view compared to the opposition. The opposition believes the Entrepreneurs' Program worked fantastically, yet they really can't point out and never really pointed out how much it was able to support SMEs in this country. We recognise that there are some people whose work is affected, but we certainly do, through the Industry Growth Program, look to engage people to help us in terms of supporting businesses. What we are trying to do is turn great ideas into stronger businesses or new firms. We will be doing that through the Industry Growth Program, connecting them with advisers and a support network. I'm a firm believer that industry can partner up with others to help mentor them and guide them in terms of growth, and we do want to see that. There is a role for grants, in particular for firms that are lower on the TRL scale, where they're potentially in what is commonly referred to as the 'valley of death'. We need to see them grow and continue to grow. We do want to support commercialisation. We've retained some of those elements in there. So we do want to have a mechanism whereby, through the Industry Growth Program, connecting them up to the NRF, we can also make happen. We'll be consulting with industry around that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well, we have allocated over $100 million in the budget to support the growth of Australia's critical technologies with a focus on quantum and AI. I imagine we'll explore some of the issues that have been raised by the coalition in relation to quantum, but we also do recognise and respect that there are issues facing us around the regulation of quantum, and I do want to respect the fact that the coalition has engaged on that matter, and we're keen to work on this. People want to see the benefit come out of AI, but they also want to manage the risks as well. We cannot afford to stop development in terms of things like, for example, our critical technologies. We're establishing roughly $19.8 million for the setting up of the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth and another $40 million to deliver a critical technologies challenge program with a particular focus on quantum. We will also look at the allocation of just over $40 million to support the responsible deployment of AI in the national economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a start. We know we have a lot more to do. We're always happy to work with the coalition, but respect that there will be times when we just don't agree. We've got a job to do. We told the Australian people we would do it, and we will get on with it. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  This is a budget which in macroeconomic terms of course fails to meet the needs of our nation, particularly as we face an extraordinary inflation challenge, which has only been fanned by the decisions in this budget. But when you look at the sector-by-sector impact, there are some pretty disappointing outcomes in this budget as well, and that is true in relation to science, for example. We've seen quite a lot of repackaging and rebadging in this budget, but we have not seen the kind of new funding that one would want to see and hope to see, consistent with the kind of rhetoric we have had from this government. For example, the measure 'enhanced support for small and medium-sized businesses and startups' and the measure 'growing Australia's critical technology industries' predominantly repurpose funding and are offset by redirecting funding from within the Industry, Science And Resources portfolio. There was no separate new funding for artificial intelligence in this budget. Instead funds were simply redirected from within the industry portfolio. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is perhaps no great surprise that the reaction from stakeholders to this budget has been less than overwhelming. The CEO of Sapia.ai, Barb Hyman, said :'This is a massive missed opportunity from the federal government to surge ahead in what is fast becoming the race to not only pioneer but leverage new AI technologies. This information is time sensitive. By the time it is a focus globally, it will be too late.' My questions to the minister are: where is the new funding for science? Where is the dedicated new funding for artificial intelligence? Why isn't this government investing more in artificial intelligence to keep pace with the rest of the world? Why was there a national quantum strategy without the provision of any additional funding to back it up? Why is there no additional funding for quantum in this budget? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the space sector and build on the excellent observations of the shadow minister for industry and Deputy Leader of the Opposition. In the space sector and under the growing Australia space industry program in the October budget there was $181 million over the forward estimates. A mere six months later nearly $70 million has been cut, with the savings partially redirected to fund other priorities. Of course, this comes at a time when developing sovereign space capability and satellite capability is key not only to business opportunities but also to strengthening our national security. Under the previous government very significant progress was being made in space. We established the Australian Space Agency, which has been based in Adelaide, and that catalysed significant industry growth with businesses like Fleet Space Technologies showing the remarkable potential of the space sector. Other entrepreneurial activities have been attracted to the South Australian Space Industry Centre, and companies like Q-CTRL and AltspaceVR have announced their involvement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly the Prime Minister has shown that he is happy to turn up for a photo opportunity at the remarkable Australian company Gilmour Space Technologies, but what is disappointing about this budget is the real lack of commitment to maintaining the substantial, long-term funding that had been provided and committed to under the previous coalition government. Of course we can all agree that the space sector provides significant opportunities for Australia, first, in fundamental research and then in commercialising that research and turning it into material business opportunities that will create jobs and growth for Australian businesses, Australian scientists and Australian workers at all levels of skill. But what is important is that the rhetoric be backed up with a detailed plan and backed up with targeted funding. On this side of the parliament we absolutely respect and cherish the central role of the private sector, but there is clearly a role for government in catalysing and stimulating. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My questions to the minister are: why has the growing Australia space industry program been cut? Why has $70 million for the Australian space industry measure been cut, and where did that money go? Why is developing a sovereign space capability not a priority of this government? Will you restore space funding to the levels it stood at under the previous coalition government? Will this government back its rhetoric with substantive support for the space sector? Why has it been, frankly, a characteristic of funding in this particular portfolio that, rather than material new funding being provided to pursue the economic opportunities that our nation faces, instead there has simply been a redirecting of funding and a cutting of many valuable existing programs?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  Australia is a country which has a lot of minerals. We have been blessed with vast quantities of valuable and useful minerals and this has helped us to become the developed and relatively wealthy country that we are lucky to be in today. These minerals still have so much to offer us, and it is only a Labor government that will do what is needed to make sure that, with the help of our critical minerals, Australia continues to move forward and remains the prosperous country that we are now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent budget again showed that this government cares about resources in this country, the sector itself, the way that the sector operates and those who work in the sector. In this budget, we committed $80.5 million to develop Australia's critical minerals sector to assist and support in the transition to net zero, drive economic growth and create high-value jobs. This builds on our announcement last year to develop a new national critical minerals strategy, which will be released soon by the Minister for Resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a true contrast between us and the lot opposite, and it is really a contrast between a sensible, capable and competent government run by the adults and a tired, incompetent government driven by its own motives. Unlike those opposite, we actually took the time to consult with industry, experts and communities, including traditional owners, and ensured they were provided an opportunity to have their say on what is important for this sector. That is exactly what the sector, which is so important to our nation, needed: a government which wants to hear from it, a government which listens to what is important to it and a government which actually cares. The result of this will be displayed when the strategy is announced. It will outline the government's priorities for the development of the critical mineral sector, including how Australia can create economic opportunities across the nation, seize the opportunities of the net-zero transformation and establish robust, sensible and diverse supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to secure strategic and commercial partnerships to develop new, diverse and resilient supply chains underpinned by critical minerals processed in Australia. We also want to help grow and mature Australia's critical minerals sector through improved and increased access to high-value overseas markets. That's why we've announced $57.1 million for the international partnership program. This includes a $40 million grant program, which will leverage the co-investment between Australia and like-minded partners to support projects that can develop an end-to-end supply chain, and $17.1 million towards chain studies to attract investment, secure tangible strategic supply partnerships and shape emerging market rules and norms to ensure Australian projects compete on a level playing field. The Critical Minerals Office does important work to coordinate, optimise and prioritise activities and actions across the government in support of growing Australia's critical minerals sector. This work is extremely valuable, so we are providing $23.4 million till 2027 to extend the operation of the Critical Minerals Office to ensure it can continue to do the work it does to help us grow our critical minerals sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But when it comes to resources, it's not just critical minerals that this government helped to prioritise in the budget; it's also gas. We have committed $37.5 million through four measures to help the gas sector thrive. We are providing $12 million for a net-zero-ready regulatory framework to make sure that Australia's regulatory framework is fit for purpose to deliver certainty for our investors. We are investing $4.5 million to develop a road map for establishing a decommissioning industry in Australia so that we can recycle and dispose of materials here. This is a multibillion dollar opportunity and a chance to service demand in Australia and the Asia Pacific. This means jobs for Australians, and this government won't let that chance slip by.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Resources are important in all parts of Australia, and we are providing $14.3 million to support emissions reduction in the Queensland energy sector. We're also providing further funding to help decommission the Northern Endeavour floating Production Storage and Offtake facility. Resources are an important part of our country. They have always been pivotal and will always remain so—perhaps even more now going forward. If you want to see a region that's built on the value of our resources, come to the Hunter and look at communities like mine. What I say to my community is this: while people want to buy our coal we will always supply our coal.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249764" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LANDRY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  Manufacturers across Australia are facing challenging times. Spiralling energy costs, severe labour force shortages and disrupted supply chains are pushing businesses to the brink of collapse. Everywhere I go and every business owner I speak to, the message is clear: import costs are going up and it's a struggle to fill vacant positions. Since I was appointed shadow assistant minister for manufacturing, I have heard from many businesses who are concerned for the future of the manufacturing sector under this government. Power prices are hitting record highs and we continue to watch the slow-motion trainwreck of energy policy under the current Labor government. The threat of energy disruption is increasing every day under this government, which seems more interested in renewable ideology than firming up the system with reliable and affordable energy supply. In fact, last month we learnt that electricity prices are continuing to spiral out of control under Labor, with increases of up to 29 per cent for small businesses from 1 July. This equates to a jump of $1,310 a year in their electricity bills. I ask the minister: what tangible solutions do you have to ease energy costs while ensuring supply remains reliable? Why the reckless race towards renewable energy when it's an unstable form of power set to drive up consumers' electricity bills?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small business is the engine room of our economy, yet this Labor government has failed to effectively help industry continue to drive the economy forward. The budget was a missed opportunity for the government to support industry and business in tackling spiralling costs, workforce shortages and supply chain prices. Australian businesses waited with bated breath leading into May's budget for outcomes that would assist with easing the pressures they face, yet the Labor government chose to forge ahead with no plan for our business community. Again, I ask the minister: how will your policies assist the manufacturing sector to stand strong against the increasing cost of production? What plans do you have to rectify the deteriorating supply chain?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's lack of action for Australian manufacturers will have a devastating impact on their productivity and will whittle away any chance of growth. This government has chosen to focus on making it more difficult for industry to expand their business and employ more Australians. Instead of creating a policy to bolster the manufacturing industry and continue the coalition's successful Modern Manufacturing Initiative fund, this government chose to redirect the Modern Manufacturing Initiative fund without having rolled out their own National Reconstruction Fund. This is a lost year for our manufacturers—12 months wasted for businesses to boost their productivity. Why did this government choose to cut the crucial Modern Manufacturing Initiative before the National Reconstruction Fund was established? Labor has promised numerous times that the National Reconstruction Fund will reinvigorate the manufacturing sector. I ask: why was there next to no funding in May's budget for the National Reconstruction Fund? If you stand by your belief that the National Reconstruction Fund is crucial to support industry, why are we seeing such delays? This government has done nothing but hold up crucial support for our industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government's strategy for manufacturing focused on creating the perfect economic conditions that are required for business—to make science and technology work for industry while focusing on areas of advantage and ensuring supply chains are more resilient. This is everything that the National Reconstruction Fund will decimate. When there is proof of a policy successfully boosting industry and the economy, why would a government tinker with a proven model? A time when industry is being confronted with energy prices skyrocketing, supply chain issues and workforce shortages, manufacturers need a government who will commit to a model which has been proven to work, not interfere with self-serving new policies that won't provide the industry relief. When will this government focus on delivering a policy that will reduce the damage inflation is causing the industry, and put forward a plan to deal with spiralling power prices? Labor's record on manufacturing is woeful, and it's concerning to think how much damage those opposite can do and will do to the industry.</span>

I am happy to take on board any other points that he or members of the coalition who are here want to ask about, but I just want to quickly touch on some of the points that were being raised by either the shadow minister or the shadow assistant minister. I can deal with the other issues the shadow minister for science raised separately. To the shadow minister for industry, we are obviously working to stand up the NRF corporation. You asked me a question about when the first investment will be made. Again, the big difference, philosophically, between us and the coalition is we are not going to be dictating funding thorough a grants process. Even the coalition know that at some point they do need to account for the way in which they made decisions based on colour-coded spreadsheets; they need to come forward and be accountable for that. We're not doing that. We are simply not doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shadow assistant minister, I will come back on MMI as a case in point, but we want a board stood up that will make those independent investment decisions guided by an investment mandate. We are going through the work of developing that, and those details will be released in the near future. We are very determined to make sure that growth capital is available for firms to help them grow. If they want to onshore manufacturing, if they want to keep manufacturing in Australia and they have a way within priority areas to do that, we definitely want to back them up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the shadow ministers for industry and science both reference space. We have said it will be included in a number of priority areas where they will have the capital. Levering off the shadow minister for science's respect for private investment and private market, with a co-investment fund where we can attract potentially support from VC, private equity or superannuation funds. Those propositions that stand up, that can deliver a rate of return and that will be able to demonstrate longer term viability will get that funding support. But it will not be for me to say 'you must' or 'thou shalt' determine when an investment will be made at what point. Those days of ministers making those calls are over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To shadow assistant minister Ley, the big difference is we get the role of grants, but with the MMI, 85 per cent of these grants were announced in the weeks leading up to the election. This MMI program was set up in 2020. Why wasn't this steadily being provided grant support to businesses getting back on their feet through lockdown? What happened? The decisions were being made on the basis of political convenience rather than national urgency. This is the big difference between us and them. Any of our grant programs, we will build in. We want people to have confidence, and the general public are tired of grants programs that have been contorted and distorted under the coalition continuing in that way. There is a better way to do things, and we will do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the coalition will say the MMI was fantastic. Well, look at the collaboration round. Theoretically, it sounded fine on paper, but trying to get that collaboration to work has been horrendously complex, and you are seeing proponents dropping like flies because they cannot stand these things up. Again, we have seen how the grant programs set up by the coalition have been executed—all out of political interest not national interest. We're just not going to go down that path of doing things in the way the coalition did. We respect and reflect community views about the way taxpayer funds should be used. On things like space, the money will be there. On things like AI and quantum, we have announced funds. For quantum, we have set up a critical technologies target fund within the NRF to make sure that that is backed in as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will make this final point. Certainly, those opposite will point to things where we have repurposed or cut funds. You cannot tell us that we have to fight inflation, cut government spending and then, the minute we do it, pick out things and say, 'No, you cannot cut that.' We are trying to do the right thing by the economy, trying to take up the fight to inflation, put downward pressure on interest rates and make sure that the capital, particularly growth capital, that they voted against is available in the NRF to back Australian industry. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the recent budgets, the Labor party has committed almost $10 million to the Environmental Defenders Office. This is an organisation who continually takes on projects to delay, to distort, to stop and to frustrate projects which are in the resources sector in particular. My first question to the minister is: can the minister guarantee that taxpayer funding in the federal Labor budget for the Environmental Defenders Office will not be used to conduct lawfare in the courts against gas and other resource projects—projects that deliver for our economy, projects that deliver jobs, projects that are critical to this nation's success, projects that Australians rely on to pay their bills. We have in the budget a federal Labor government that is funding an organisation whose sole purpose appears to be shutting down and delaying projects that matter. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear about cuts and we hear from the minister about how we can't have it both ways. The minister also can't have it both ways. The budget has an additional spend of $185 billion. You can't claim that you have reduced spending when you have increased it by $185 billion. What was cut out of the budget that matters are funding around development for the Beetaloo basin, funding for strategic gas plans and funding across the board to ensure that these projects come on earlier than we thought they would otherwise happen, because the projects are needed. They add to our GDP and they secure our nation. They make it more nationally secure, and that is important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My second question to the minister is: how does the minister expect additional gas supplies to be developed when the Labor government has cut funding for strategic gas basin plans and the Beetaloo basin development and continues to support Victoria's prohibition of gas development in that state? You cannot have more gas if you don't develop any gas. You cannot rely on gas, for all of the things that they claim to rely on it for, if you don't actually develop any.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A CSIRO report in 2022 identified that carbon capture and storage in depleted gas basins could store literal gigatonnes of CO2. Why do the minister and this government continue to support the ridiculous position of the Minister for Climate Change and Energy but not utilise this type of technology for what those opposite claim is important? In fact, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy went to the MAN Energy Solutions factory in Germany, with great hoo-ha and lots of pic ops. Guess what they do. They build multistage, super-high-pressure pumps for carbon capture and storage to do this type of work, and they have sold hundreds of them around the world. Whilst you'll celebrate in Germany, you won't utilise the technology in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen from this government the most remarkable intervention in the resources sector in our country's history for projects that have been put in place for years under a set of rules and policies that they made decisions on for tens of billions of dollars. Now we see proposals where two ministers in particular can make a decision on a business-by-business basis as to whether those rules will apply to them. It is incredible. We have seen the ambassador of Japan say that there is now sovereign risk in this nation. This has never happened before. Can the minister name any other jurisdiction, apart from China, Russia and North Korea, where two ministers can arbitrarily determine whether a mandatory code, an intervention or a price cap can be retrospectively applied and applied on a business-by-business basis?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We continue to hear about the Beetaloo basin. The Northern Territory has made some announcements about that recently. What we have seen in the budget is a cut to the fund that helps develop that basin earlier than it might have otherwise been because it is important for jobs in the Northern Territory. It's important for driving the economy. It's important for the east coast gas market—if you can hook it up. So I say to the minister: what is the earliest possible date that Beetaloo basin gas is expected to be available on the east coast gas market, in particular given that they've cut the plans for developing the gas infrastructure program in Australia? If you don't have any pipelines of sufficient capacity, you can't transfer gas, so how is it that the minister expects to meet the target of increased gas by cutting gas and how he expects that it'll drive down the price of gas by having less supply and they'll have more development by intervening in markets where people have made decisions for tens of billions of dollars and now consider Australia to be a location of sovereign risk?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in the last seconds I have, has the minister been advised of any previously announced projects that have taken an FID, a final investment decision, which will now be delayed or cancelled because of the Labor's government policies and the decisions that they've made in their budget?</span>
                </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  Manufacturing industries are fundamental pillars of our economy, creating jobs and delivering the products that Australia needs. We, in the Albanese Labor government, know that we cannot continue to neglect the manufacturing industry in our country as those opposite did. The Liberals have often taken Australian manufacturing for granted and failed to grasp the reality of its importance. Don't forget that they were the government that dared the car manufacturers to leave, displaying a complete lack of understanding and respect for the invaluable work done by our manufacturing workers.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr LAXALE:</span>
                    </a>  Yes, I was, actually. I remember it vividly: Joe Hockey on the front page daring GM to leave—I remember reading that paper; I might send you a copy one day, in case you've forgotten. And the consequences of their negligence were evident in the numbers. When they came to power, there were 922,000 manufacturing workers, and by the time they lost government—and thank goodness they did!—last year, that number had dropped to 856,000 workers. That's 66,000 manufacturing jobs that were lost by the negligence of the previous government. We know that they're happy to dress up in hi-vis but they're never prepared to back the hi-vis, as the minister says so often.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, we now have a new government and a minister that have a different vision for the future of manufacturing in Australia. We have a government that understands that supporting domestic manufacturing is not just an economic imperative but an initiative that will help the future of our country. We recognise the immense potential for growth and the creation of secure, well-paid employment in this sector and that the decisions that this government makes today will shape the manufacturing jobs of tomorrow. That's why I'm proud to be a part of a government that puts industry and manufacturing at the forefront of its Industry Growth Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Innovation and industry are incredibly important in my own electorate of Bennelong, especially in the vibrant economic hub of Macquarie Park. Macquarie Park is part of Sydney's global economic corridor. It is Sydney's second-largest business district. And it is home to a growing community of residents and to global businesses and an emerging network of startups, scale-ups and innovators. Macquarie Park is testament to the potential and entrepreneurial spirit that exists within our nation. And good government policy supporting innovators will enable them to thrive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Labor government, Macquarie Park and similar regions will receive the support they need to thrive, through the $392 million invested into the Industry Growth Program. This substantial funding demonstrates our commitment to nurturing and expanding manufacturing industry. The Industry Growth Program will provide the necessary support and resources for startups and small-to-medium businesses so that they can grow and contribute to our national economy. With matched grant funding ranging from $50,000 to $5 million, we will empower emerging businesses to become the engines of future employment growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The program serves as a direct feeder into the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, targeting projects in key areas such as renewables; medical science, which is incredibly important in my electorate of Bennelong; transport; agriculture, forestry and fisheries; resources; and defence capability and enabling capabilities as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And let's not forget: this is a nation-building fund that those opposite voted against. They say they're for manufacturing, but they opposed the NRF. Shame!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long in Australia, we have dug up our resources, shipped them overseas and then bought them back, paying more at each and every step. By directing the focus on investments from this fund into priority areas, we are working to ensure a future for Australia in which we are at the forefront of innovation, so that we can create more well-paid jobs and drive economic growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Industry Growth Program is just one part of what the government is doing for industry in this budget. We're also providing $14.8 million to establish the Powering Australia Industry Growth Centre, to help businesses manufacture, commercialise and adopt to renewable technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget demonstrates the government's commitments to supporting industry and leading the way towards a prosperous future for all Australians. In particular, the NRF has hit a chord with our growing, emerging innovation sector. They're excited to see what the NRF can deliver. Investment in small-to-medium businesses and emerging industries is something that we know will bring manufacturing home. We learnt during the pandemic that, with no manufacturers around, we weren't able to manufacture the medical equipment that we needed. We also had huge supply chain issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have two questions for the minister: What is the government doing to ensure that programs like this are getting the best value for money? And how is this program delivering a joined-up approach to policies so that we're giving clear signals to industry about when they can expect support and how they'll get it?</span>

Unlike the members and senators of the Albanese Labor government, I want to acknowledge and thank the hardworking men and women in hi-vis who work in our resources industry. The Albanese Labor government has clearly forgotten to thank the hard workers in the resources sector. Instead, they slam them at every chance they get.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I often wonder what has happened to the Labor Party. The old Labor Party would never have given in to the green policies above what is right for the hi-vis worker. The old Labor Party used to stand up for the miners and stand up for the resource sector. Now, they just tax the life out of them. The Labor Party's constituency base used to be the worker. These days, they're in an identity crisis. It isn't clear what they stand for or what values they base their policies on. What is clear is that they no longer value the hardworking Aussie. Instead, they penalise those who work hard and those who want to get ahead without relying on government handouts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor reward the loud minority groups and forget about the quiet Australians who just want to get on with the job without whingeing and complaining. Despite the billions of dollars of returns, wages, royalties and taxes that the resources sector provides the economy, this Albanese Labor government has refused to reinvest in the sector. The coalition has continued to warn of the risk to the future prosperity of the resources sector if it continues to be abandoned by this government. Unfortunately, these warnings have been ignored.</span>

                    </a>  We'll get to that. I'll get to that—thank you. Labor's divided cabinet continues to send mixed messages to the industry. Some ministers are calling for the end of the coal and gas sector, and others are heralding its lengthy future. Why would companies invest with this unstable government? This unstable government's position is making our international partners very nervous. Japan recently expressed serious concerns to the Prime Minister regarding supply. It seems that these concerns have fallen on deaf ears.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mining sector directly employs 286,000 people and indirectly supports over 1.1 million jobs. In 2022, the mining industry paid over $38 billion in salaries to Australian workers. In my electorate, thousands of hardworking men and women go out west to work. Their homes and families are in Mackay and other regional areas in Dawson. Not only is Dawson home to many mining and manufacturing workers but Mackay is a maintenance hub for the mining companies. It's not just the mine workers and their families that rely on their jobs. Small businesses rely on people having those jobs. Our house prices and investments rely on people having those jobs. The city folk need to thank us in rural and regional Australia for keeping their lights on, for keeping their houses warm in winter and cool during summer. We know how important the resource industry is to the economy. Australia exported $112.8 billion worth of coal in 2022, and it's given the Labor government the ability to spruik and take credit for their budget surplus. And yet the Treasurer could not even bring himself to mention mining, coal, gas or the other commodities that we export. He called them 'things' in the budget. So my question to the minister is: Do you see a long future for Australian coal? Will you personally support and assist in the development of new coalmines? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry and Science</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  In the member for Dawson's contribution, I think the only thing he got right was 'Good morning'. It all went downhill from there. The apex of the asinine was the suggestion that ministers were divided and that we're arguing about the end of coal and gas, and yet he can produce no proof. In the world of the coalition, no proof is required. And yet I as a minister have said that there is a need for gas and coal, particularly as I have fought for industrial manufacturers, and there will be a continuing need for a period of time. But, as the rest of the world is, we are obviously trying to ramp up sustainable energy generation longer term, and you are seeing the huge investment in it. That's all being done. I know that there are talking points that need to be rolled out and I know that you're trying to build this theme, but at some point even a tenuous connection to fact might be helpful in making those points.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of what manufacturers need—and we've had a number of people from the coalition talk about that—we are certainly thinking it through. The member for Bennelong asked about having a joined-up policy approach and ensuring value for money. Certainly we have been putting in place, apart from the NRF, the Industry Growth Program that you referred to, making sure we've got grants available for small and medium-sized enterprises and new firms as well. That's what we're hoping that we will get through the Industry Growth Program. We want consistency so that, from the starting point through to maturity, we have that level of support at different levels. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have often said, we want Australia to be a country that makes things. We want to rebuild manufacturing capability in this country. We have certainly looked at prioritising the needs of manufacturers—for instance, in terms of skills. Skills shortages are a big issue. Those opposite let it just drag on and did very little about it. We are trying to invest in people's skills here—for example, with TAFE fee-free places, the investments we're making in higher ed and making sure that those skills are available for manufacturers, as well as, where we need to, bringing in talent, reforming our visa system and making that a reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of energy inputs, we have done what we have needed to do—and we'll always do more if we have to—to stabilise prices, bring them down and make sure those energy inputs are reduced. The growth capital that is available to ensure that firms that want to grow can do so is very important. That growth capital, particularly through the NRF, is really important. I like to help the shadow minister for industry. I'm very concerned about your repeated references to certain things, and I don't want them to ricochet. I am a nice guy. You just have to ask me. A number of times you have referred to our 'lack of consultation'. We had over 200 submissions with the NRF. We had a Senate inquiry process and we've been consulting with industry on it. They recognise that, at a time when it is hard to get that growth capital, it is there. I'm just concerned that you keep making those claims, and I don't want that to ricochet towards you, because, as I said, I'm a caring soul. </span>

A year on, we are delivering on our commitments. Our landmark First Nations Justice package is just starting to get going and beginning to roll out. We're investing in housing and services in the Northern Territory homelands. We've signed an agreement with the Northern Territory government to deliver on a $100 million commitment to improve housing and infrastructure in Northern Territory homelands. We're fixing the failed CDP and replacing it with real jobs, real wages and proper conditions. It was in a terrible state when we became the government, and it is going to take some time to sort through. We will invest $97 million to support the New Jobs Program Trial. That is showing some early positive signs. We're making Indigenous Australians a part of the way we engage with the world through the appointment of a First Nations ambassador, Justin Mohamed. By working with the Coalition of Peaks on closing the gap, we are improving First Nations health infrastructure, including renal services in the city and the bush. There are 500 extra First Nations health workers being trained up, working in partnership with Aboriginal community controlled health services. We know that so much more needs to be done, but in our first year we've certainly hit the ground running. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week I spent time with the member for Lingiari and others in the Northern Territory. I visited Darwin, Katherine and the remote communities of Barunga and Rockhole. We listened to elders, community members and service providers. Our plan, a better, safer future for Central Australia, is having an impact. In partnership with the Northern Territory government, we are tackling alcohol related harm by strengthening alcohol restrictions so that town camps and communities are once again dry zones. We are providing more opportunities for young people, giving them hope for the future. Importantly, we're working in partnership with local communities because we know the best solutions come from local communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Later this year, Australians will vote in a referendum to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in our Constitution through a voice to the parliament so their communities can finally have a say on laws and policies that affect them. It's about making better, more effective policies that deliver practical change on the ground in areas like health, education and housing. The budget extends existing funding to enable the investment of $20 million to progress regional voices and local arrangements. Our commitment to Torres Strait Islander Australians is very real. We want to do business differently and we are. The beginning of a new chapter will make our nation proud.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  Labor sold its federal budget as putting women at the centre, but a closer look merely shows a mixed approach to women's policies. Whilst the coalition has welcomed some of these measures, Australian women deserve more than this. Despite highlighting in the Women's Budget Statement that the workforce participation gap between men and women is largest in their prime child-rearing years, the government did not extend funding for the Career Revive program, which was introduced by the coalition. This program supported businesses to attract and retain women returning to work after a career break. Given the data shows that women are more likely to step out of the workforce when starting a family, what is the government's plan to support these women getting back into work?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite being highlighted by the government's own Women's Economic Equality Taskforce, the government didn't make changes to Paid Parental Leave or superannuation in this budget or make any changes to child care. Whilst the coalition isn't calling for these specific measures to be implemented, the government is ignoring the advice of their own hand-picked task force when it comes to achieving economic equality. Labor's budget was full of healthcare headlines, but it was almost empty on measures relating to mental health and women's health. According to Beyond Blue, around one in six women in Australia will experience depression and one in three women will experience anxiety during their lifetime. Women also experience post-traumatic stress disorder at higher rates than men; however, the Labor government cut the number of Medicare subsidised psychology sessions in half. These extra 10 sessions are critical for some of the most vulnerable people in our society, particularly young women. That is why the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, announced in his budget in reply speech that the coalition is committed to permanently reinstating the full 20 Medicare subsidised psychology sessions that we originally introduced in government. Why won't the government reinstate these sessions, especially as they'll predominantly benefit young women?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government badged the increase of bulk-billing incentives and the Workforce Incentive Program as a women's health measure; however, there wasn't much in the budget to support specific women's health issues. That's why the opposition leader confirmed the coalition's commitment to investing $4 million to Ovarian Cancer Australia so they can continue their critical work. Further, the coalition announced it would allocate $5 million to review women-specific health items on the Medicare Benefits Schedule and corresponding treatments on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The review will identify what best-practice women-specific medical services are not listed and ensure clinically effective services and treatments remain affordable and accessible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has welcomed the government's measures relating to women's safety in the budget; however, despite big promises, when coming to government, to end domestic violence in a generation, the Albanese government has failed to deliver single community worker through its election pledge to create 500 new frontline roles, despite funding the measure in the October budget, over seven months ago. When the measure was funded, the Albanese government promised to have 200 new workers employed this financial year. With just days to go and with no workers in place, this milestone is in tatters. We have also learnt that the government carved up the amount of funding for these workers based on electorates first, not by need. The government promised there would be 200 new community workers on the ground by now. Minister, where are these workers that you promised? Can you provide an updated timeline of when we can expect to see these 500 new community workers delivered as promised? We also urge the government to finalise the first action plan that sits under the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children 2022-2032. Given this action plan will detail the actions, investments and measurements of success, it is imperative that this action plan is delivered as quickly as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has noted previously that this first five-year plan was expected to be released in early 2023. We are now more than halfway through 2023, and there has been no movement. Despite the importance of this policy, the government has once again failed to deliver on a promise on time. It has now been revealed that the first action plan will not be delivered until August. Minister, can you guarantee that the Australian public will see the first action plan in August? Whilst the coalition has welcomed some of the measures in the budget, Australian women of all ages and from all backgrounds deserve more than what this government is promising to deliver.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  I want to say how proud I am to be part of the Albanese Labor government alongside Minister Burney and other colleagues in talking about how we are investing in a better future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people right across our country, from my home electorate of Robertson to the Northern Territory, where the member for Lingiari is from, right across our vast country. In particular I want to focus on our investments in First Nations health care. In First Nations communities Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people suffer some of the worst rates of chronic illness, not just chronic illness but also exacerbations of those chronic illnesses that are leading to presentations to emergency departments and requiring broad-based care or, even worse, intensive care and beyond. Some of those healthcare investments in the First Nations space include tripling the bulk-billing incentive, which I will touch on in a minute, and the support to deliver dialysis units for First Nations communities in regional and remote Australia for people with end-stage renal failure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">End-stage renal failure, for those in the chamber who do not know what it is and want more information, is a debilitating chronic illness that will inevitably require dialysis or renal replacement therapy. We're talking about patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, and in First Nations communities that is normally the result of uncontrolled hypertension or high blood pressure and also uncontrolled type 2 diabetes that has not been treated with lifestyle modification or oral antihyperglycemics, which are tablets, or insulin therapy. That leads to irreversible kidney damage then requiring renal replacement therapy or dialysis. Part of this investment is making sure that our First Nations communities can access this dialysis and these medical treatments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we have patients with advanced chronic kidney disease that's left untreated, particularly those who have end-stage renal failure, we start to see what are called uraemic symptoms and volume overload. To break that down, volume overload is where the body cannot get rid of the fluid and therefore the fluid will build up in the legs causing what we call oedema, which can then cause infected wound and like and can track up to the lungs and cause pulmonary oedema, essentially meaning the patient drowns if that is not treated. The other aspect is the uraemic symptoms. There are three big symptoms that we talk about in renal failure. One is pleurisy, an inflammation of the lining of the lungs. That not only causes severe, debilitating pain when the patient is breathing at rest but also pericarditis, which is an inflammation of the lining of the heart causing severe chronic chest pain that is often unable to be treated. Finally, and this is quite a severe silent symptom of end-stage renal failure where the patient has not undergone dialysis or renal replacement therapy, there's encephalopathy where the toxins build up in the blood and the body and then the patient becomes delirious, which can result in significant harm to the patient and their family as well as the healthcare staff supporting the patient through the illness. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just some of the examples as to why dialysis is necessary in our community but, in particular, why dialysis is important in our First Nations communities. With higher rates of high blood pressure, higher rates of high cholesterol, higher rates of type 2 diabetes where tablets, insulin and lifestyle modification just do not exist, that is why we need access to these vital medical services because, if we do not provide those medical services, there will be significant morbidity and, even worse, significant mortality. We know that macrovascular complications, including heart attack and stroke, result from end-stage renal failure and diabetes, which is part of that disease profile. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, to move to the bulk-billing incentive, this will have a positive impact for just over 300,000 First Nations people with concession cards. I don't have to tell those in the chamber the benefits of primary care and general practice. It's all about prevention. It prevents disease from becoming an acute, exacerbated illness where someone is going to require the highest level of care in our emergency departments or in our intensive care units. That is just one way that the Albanese government is assisting our First Nations communities. I want to thank the ministers for their hard work and support in this area and the Prime Minister for his work in First Nations support.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  When Indigenous Australians come to Canberra to seek meetings with the government and the nation's leaders, why are the doors closed to them? Aboriginal Australians, just like all Australians, are currently not defined by race. But when Aboriginal parliamentarians brought in delegations of Aboriginal Australians who reject the new bureaucracy, neither the Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Prime Minister, any other assistant ministers or even their staff would meet with them. Earlier this year, Senator Nampijinpa Price brought a delegation for all parliamentarians to hear Aboriginal voices from all over Australia—Arnhem Land, Cowra, Ngukurr, Redfern and the ACT—who do not believe the solution is a Canberra based government body. Why did Labor refuse to listen to their voices?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Albanese's Voice is based on a false ideology that Indigenous Australians are inherently disadvantaged by race—that a university educated person of Aboriginal descent on a good public service salary in a leafy Canberra suburb faces the same challenges as an unemployed kid who didn't finish school in a regional or remote community. The Uluru statement speaks of high rates of incarceration within Aboriginal populations. While people are afraid to go to sleep at night in Alice Springs, should they take comfort that the solution lies in Prime Minister Albanese's proposed voice?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also given us a $40 million commitment for on-country learning to encourage school attendance. When will the government tell us what on-country learning looks like and how it will be measured? The Labor 2023-24 budget includes a commitment to establish a national peak body for First Nations family safety. Is this not the creation of another Indigenous voice? In the absence of this new peak body, are stakeholders not really heard by this government? Will the government show us how Prime Minister Albanese's Voice will make a practical difference in the lives of disadvantaged Australians? It's long been held that this should be a bipartisan approach and that not doing that would be damaging to the cause. Why has the Prime Minister adopted a 'my way or the highway' approach to the establishment of the Voice?</span>

Can the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister explain why the Labor government won't legislate the voice?

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  I have watched for many years and listened from outside the halls of parliament while the former government grandstanded and did little more than pay lip service to issues relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I just listened to the last speech and that says all that we need to know. We have had many governments all completely unable to bring the attention and nuance required to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians portfolio.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Successfully managing issues relating to Aboriginal Australians and their communities takes tact, it takes integrity and it takes commitment. These are the qualities Prime Minister Albanese and Minister Burney have in spades. They understand the issues. They have the grace and respect to listen and to act on the wishes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. They do not merely stand at the pulpit and preach self-determination; they embed it in government policy. Nowhere is this more evident than in Central Australia and the Northern Territory. The issues that are played out in the media, which the opposition have so shamelessly played politics with, are deep-rooted. Anyone with an understanding of the policy context knows that the foundations for today's troubles date back to the coalition's intervention in the Northern Territory. A mishmash of policy and funding investments, or lack thereof, have created the tsunami of problems in our towns, regions and communities. The crippling underfunding of infrastructure in remote communities and homelands, as well as the hamstringing of the Community Development Employment Program, have left our bush communities in a challenging spot.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our federal Labor government has rapidly responded to the evolving and complex situation across Central Australia. Our response has many facets, but is centred on the $250 million Central Australia plan, a robust set of investments aimed at supporting our communities. The plan addresses several critical issues aimed at restoring safety and cohesion. This is done not only through more youth programs and better-targeted services but also by supporting high-visibility police and security operations. Already, the Lhere Artepe Aboriginal traditional owner patrols funded by the federal government have had great success in reducing the number of young people involved in antisocial behaviour. We are hearing daily from businesses and local community members about the difference these patrols are making. The plan incorporates the broader work of government on reforming the broken CDP program and bringing meaningful community-controlled jobs back to people on the ground.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An issue I am really passionate about that I share with the Minister for Indigenous Australians is fetal alcohol spectrum disorder or FASD. We don't often talk about FASD. It is easy to pander to the right-wing base, as the opposition leader does, but what we really need is a health response. FASD diagnosis was sitting at 18 months when we came to government. The Central Australia plan will inject an additional $23.5 million into health services to support much-needed work in diagnosis and treatment services for FASD.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another measure of the Central Australia plan is additional funding for justice reinvestment. Justice reinvestment is real policy in action. It involves bringing the community together, building coalitions of organisations and affecting real change. By reducing the contact of young people within the criminal justice system, we can change the trajectories of our most vulnerable people. The Central Australia plan is also making much-needed investments in our education system. Education and our schools are at the frontline of solving the challenges of our young people. With a $40 million investment, our Central Australian schools will finally have the resources they need to do their valuable work. So you can see we finally have a government that is committed to real, tangible action on the ground, a government that understands the challenges on the ground. Aboriginal Australians, particularly those in the Northern Territory, have had to wait far too long, but finally we have a federal government that's committed to a better future for all our mob across the Northern Territory. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  In October the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme announced a review of the NDIS to improve the wellbeing of Australians with disability and the scheme's sustainability, as we now find out. The independent review, we're told, was established to look at the design, operations and sustainability of the NDIS, even though the then shadow minister never claimed that there were any issues with sustainability and indeed criticised the government of the day for talking about the sustainability of the NDIS. NDIS participants and taxpayers eagerly want to hear how the government will specifically tackle the worsening challenges for the NDIS and sadly have been left none the wiser following the minister's address to the Press Club in April. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Senate estimates we learned that the NDIS was not consulted—a stunning admission in the Senate estimates—regarding the imposition of the arbitrary annual NDIS growth cap of eight per cent. The government came to the conclusion that the annual growth cap on the total cost would be no more than eight per cent by 1 July 2026, without any explanation of how these cuts to the growth of the scheme would be achieved and indeed who would lose out as a result of those cuts. The independent review panel is to deliver a final report to disability reform ministers by no later than the end of October 2023, yet 12 months down the track the Labor government has shown no signs of progress or findings, sadly leaving hundreds of thousands of participants in limbo and in fear of losing access to their funding under the scheme, particularly families with a child with an autism diagnosis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming into government, Labor has made a serious habit of outsourcing problems, and, in this case, it seems that the independent review is doing all the heavy lifting. Since the announcement of the review, the government and minister have repeatedly used the review as cover for inaction. All we've heard is the minister making his usual motherhood statements, identifying issues and never offering any solutions. It was announced that the head of NDIS review secretariat, Mr James Kelly, a highly respected and regarded Treasury public servant, would lead the review secretariat. My questions for the minister in relation to PM&amp;C are as follows: please outline the selection process that led to Mr Kelly's appointment to the NDIS secretariat. Mr Kelly is no longer leading the secretariat, leaving very unexpectedly and surprisingly in March this year. What are the events that led to Mr Kelly's departure from the secretariat after only eight months? Who decided that Mr Kelly would be leaving his role within the NDIS review secretariat? Did the review co-chairs have any involvement in Mr Kelly's departure, and, if so, please outline that involvement? Was Mr Kelly given the opportunity to remain in his role within the secretariat? Please outline the process which led to the selection of Mr Kelly's replacement, Mr David Hazlehurst. How many public servants are working with the review, and what are their APS band levels? What appropriation has been provided for the review? Please also provide a breakdown of the costs associated with the review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are told the review is due to report in October 2023. Is it still on target to report in that time frame? As of 1 June, how many submissions have been received by the secretariat? Please provide a breakdown of the submission types between written, audio and video. As of 1 June, how many direct consultations have been held, and how many are still to be held before the review is set to conclude? For each of the consultations, please also provide details of where the venue was and the number of attendees that were involved. As of 1 June, how many NDIS webinars have taken place, and how many participants have taken part in each of the webinars? Mr Deputy Speaker, as you can see from all of these questions, precious little is known at this stage about staffing of the review and indeed the circumstances of Mr James Kelly's departure from the review. We want answers, and we want confirmation that the review, so much of which is being relied upon by the government, is set to deliver its findings by October this year, as promised.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="296272" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  What will you be thinking about when you take your last breath? This is what Australian of the Year Taryn Brumfitt asked people. She says no one ever says that they will be thinking about their cellulite or their thigh gap or lack thereof. In 2009, following the birth of her third child, Taryn Brumfitt headed off to a plastic surgeon. She wanted to 'fix' her post-baby body, as she puts it. But watching her young daughter play, she had an epiphany. How could she teach her daughter about positivity and to love her body if she couldn't do it for herself? She says this thought trapped her. She wanted to fix her body but she also wanted to set the right example for her daughter. So she tried bodybuilding, even competing, but found that it was a tough lifestyle to maintain and that she was always grumpy. More importantly, even though she now had the so-called perfect body, she still didn't feel any better about it. She worked out that it actually wasn't about what she looked like; it was about the psychology of how she felt about her body. From these beginnings, she started the Body Image Movement in 2012 and has been tirelessly advocating for body positivity and acceptance, particularly among young people, ever since.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taryn happens to live around the corner from me in Boothby, and she is already doing Boothby proud with her unwavering determination on her body positive mission. We know that in Boothby, and all across Australia, the concerns raised by Taryn strike a chord with many. A national survey from the Butterfly Foundation, an Australian eating disorders not-for-profit, found that more than 40 per cent of Australians are dissatisfied with their appearance, and as many as 73 per cent wish they could change the way they look. Seventy per cent of Australian school children consider body image to be their No. 1 concern, and young people in Australia who have poor body image are 24 times more likely to be depressed or suffer from anxiety. This is a confronting statistic and one that tells us we need to do more to prevent the harmful impacts of poor body image issues, particularly in young people in Australia. That's why Taryn's recognition as Australian of the Year is so impactful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through her work as Australian of the Year, Taryn's mission and her Body Image Movement has been elevated to reach even more Australians, and Taryn has begun helping more people learn to embrace their bodies. Her goal of educating the global community has been off to a flying start with her documentaries <span style="font-style:italic;">Embrace</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Embrace Kids</span> being seen all around the world. Her books, <span style="font-style:italic;">Embrace Yourself </span>and <span style="font-style:italic;">Embrace Your Body </span>have also been great resources for people of all ages. The 'embrace' message is one of embracing your body as a superpower. As Taryn says, 'Your body is your home, and it's the most spectacular place to live.' Through her role as Australian of the Year, Taryn is spreading her important messages far and wide—that it is not our life's mission to be at war with our body.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taryn is now setting her sights on yet another admirable goal: to reach one million kids, as well as their teachers, parents, sports coaches, early childhood workers and the whole village surrounding our children. With her evidence-informed resources and her tenacity, Taryn is well on the way to achieving her goal. She recently gave a keynote address entitled 'Supporting girls to embrace' at the 2023 Asia Pacific Summit on Girls' Education in Hobart, presenting evidence on how to reduce appearance pressure through improved health and wellbeing. She also spoke up for the need for diverse and different bodies to be seen by Australians on screen, as part of the Bodies On Screen panel at ACMI, alongside disability advocate Carly Findlay and other activists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Added to a long list of advocacy work, keynotes and interviews, it is clear that Taryn has been fearless in her mission for us to rethink our relationship with our bodies as Australian of the Year. Her important work as an advocate for body positivity shows us how important the role of Australian of the Year is not only in recognising achievement but also in continuing the conversation and raising important social issues. I know Taryn will continue to do Boothby proud as she continues her vital work, changing the way that Australians think about their bodies. As Taryn says, it's not our bodies that need to change; it is our perspective. And I think I speak for all of us, certainly all of Boothby, when I say I'm excited to see how she changes even more perspectives throughout her journey this year as Australian of the Year.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300124" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TINK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  My question today is for the Office for Women under the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The 2023-24 federal budget contained record investment to end violence against women, and there is no doubt the additional $589.3 million invested in women's safety was welcome. That funding contributes to a total commitment of $1.3 billion over six years to support the implementation of the first phase of the new <span style="font-style:italic;">National </span><span style="font-style:italic;">plan to end violence against women and children</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2022-2032</span>. But, sadly, even at that level, this funding barely touches the sides of what is required to truly enable those facing violence to escape without ending up in poverty. As a parliament we cannot simply measure our efforts by what our government is prepared to spend. Rather, all of us in this place must hold ourselves accountable for genuine progress to end violence against women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022, 56 women lost their lives to domestic violence, and at least 16 more have lost their lives in the past six months alone. That's nearly one woman a week for the past 18 months. In this context, then, when the sector is asking for $1 billion a year, we simply cannot afford to just take what is given and we must continue to challenge ourselves, our society and our government to do better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The extension of the escaping violence payment for a further three years is neither a new initiative nor an improvement of an existing one. As such, it is problematic for this to be claimed as a win. The rollout has been rough, with women waiting up to three months for the payment and with poor service delivery leaving many in limbo. This is then compounded by the fact that each woman accessing this payment is only entitled to a maximum of $5,000, which includes a maximum of $1,500 in cash to help establish a new home. This is $1,500 to pay for the bond on a property, to connect your internet and your essential services, to connect your power and to cover any other cash costs associated with leaving in a market where affordable housing is simply unavailable. The value of this payment has not kept pace with the cost of living, and by simply extending it we risk providing a cover that ultimately does nothing more than create greater distress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be trapped and to then think you see an exit, only to realise it's a pathway to another form of abuse through financial poverty, is a devastating experience. Family and domestic violence is the main reason women and children leave their homes in Australia, and it's the leading cause of homelessness for women in our country. While this budget includes $100 million over five years to extend the Safe Places program, which provides emergency accommodation for women and children escaping violence, services in North Sydney are struggling to even find accommodation they can rent to expand the shelters and help women. In the last 12 months alone, rental prices across North Sydney have skyrocketed, with the average weekly rent for a unit now $675, while it's $1,100 for a home. In this context, $100 million over five years will struggle to provide meaningful support for the thousands of women and children who need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the physical hurdles associated with leaving, there are often the additional hurdles that are intrinsic to navigating the justice system. While this budget provides funding for the national expansion of the Lighthouse project, which was a pilot initiative run in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia that used a confidential risk-screening questionnaire to triage family parenting matters to try to enable women and children to recover financially and move on with their lives, the numbers don't lie. Seven out of 10 women leave their assets behind when they finally make a break, and 90 per cent struggle to obtain a property settlement. I have heard firsthand from those who have experienced all sorts of abuse that the abuse does not end with the relationship. Violent partners use the family court system to continue to destabilise the lives of the ones who have left, compelling them to commit financially to court appearances and proceedings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">National plan to end violence against women and children</span> underpins the efforts of all Australian governments to end violence against women and children in one generation. It breaks my heart to say that, despite the record investment in this last budget, we are nowhere near the level of change that needs to be achieved to reach this lofty goal. I would like to ask the minister, then, why the government continues to offer such meagre investment in one of the most pressing issues facing our society.</span>

These are genuine documents of teamwork, where thousands and thousands of people come together to find the policy solutions put forward to government and then to the parliament, where we get to both analyse and vote upon them. On that measure, I want to thank the officials I've worked with closely in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Australian Public Service Commission, the National Australia Day Council, the Office of Impact Analysis and, indeed, those at Government House and the Honours Secretariat, all of whom, amongst many others, do terrific work serving this nation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to note that I'm really proud that we have seen the women's budget statement put back, front and centre, in the budget process. It was hard to understand why that went away, but it is very welcome that it is back. I will quickly say: on the speeches we've heard today, I think my colleague the Minister for Indigenous Australians outlined the government's agenda so well when it comes to implementing the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full. I want to commend the member for Robertson in not just sharing what some of the investments in Indigenous health mean but also explaining a little bit more about the physical and social impacts of diabetes, and I think he did that incredibly well. The member for Lingiari showed her ongoing passionate advocacy for the reduction and addressing of FASD. And the member for Boothby did a terrific job of advocating and highlighting the terrific work of our Australian of the Year, Ms Taryn Brumfitt.</span>

I need say no more.</span>

It's because of how the opposition has chosen, unnecessarily, to politicise an important debate around the Voice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget delivers on what the Australian people voted for: to end a wasted decade and to get moving again. We are doing clear things like making child care cheaper; making medicines cheaper; increasing the minimum wage; making sure we fund a pay increase for aged-care workers; delivering fee-free TAFE places so more people can get the skills and the good, high-quality, secure jobs that they want; delivering 20,000 new university places, including 3,000 in Western Australia; making sure we deliver on our commitment for new energy apprenticeships, which I was pleased to announce alongside the Prime Minister at East Perth TAFE just a month or two ago; and making sure we do deliver on our commitments to support those tragically experiencing domestic violence, including the now legislated 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave. We initiated the robodebt royal commission to make sure that we increase integrity standards in government, and we are advancing a Voice to Parliament.</span>

To be asked about appointment processes by someone who served as a minister in the former government, which will be famous forever for one particular type of appointment process—the appointment process that those opposite presided over was the secret ministries scandal. Let's not forget that this was something that happened for years throughout the former government. We saw the advice from the Solicitor-General and we have seen an inquiry held into this, both of which are damning. We saw five departments with secret ministers, where the most senior public servants in those departments didn't even know they existed. The ministers didn't even know they existed—the minister for health, the Minister for Finance, the minister for industry, the Treasurer and the Minister for Home Affairs. As Solicitor-General Dr Stephen Donaghue KC said, 'The principles of responsible government are fundamentally undermined by the actions of the former government.' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I thank all the honourable members for their interest in this important portfolio area. I'm happy to be representing the Minister for Finance and Manager of Government Business in the Senate in this important consideration in detail of these matters. I commend her for the excellent work that she's doing as a part of the government's economic team and the extraordinary work that we've done in turning around a pretty parlous budgetary situation but also helping the government but, more importantly, Australians and small businesses to navigate their way through a cost-of-living crisis and very difficult economic circumstances. As they do that, they know that they've got a government in their corner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's targeted cost-of-living relief in the area of energy price relief, which honourable members across the other side of the chamber, the coalition parties, opposed. At the same time as allegedly championing the concerns of members and their electorates, they were voting against energy price relief, which beggars belief. There's the stuff we are doing in child care—the measures that will be coming into effect in a few weeks time—and the extraordinary leaps forward that we're making in restoring aged care from the mess that we inherited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On medicines, we're on the side of people who want cheaper medicines and more affordable medicines and health care. The coalition are on the side of people who want Australians to pay more for their health care and medicines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the underlying fiscal circumstances: a year ago, the budget was forecast to be nearly $80 billion in deficit. Those were the circumstances that we inherited. Today, we stand here with a budget which forecasts a $4.2 billion surplus. There's been a lot of hard work that has gone into this and some difficult decisions that we've made that our predecessors refused to make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In delivering an improved budget balance, we're making a down payment on what governments can do in the future, because every dollar that we take off our debt is a dollar less that we have to pay in interest payments, which is one of the fastest-growing areas of expenditure on the government's books. In taking action to rebuild our fiscal buffers, there are some key things in this budget that I bring to the attention of members. Eighty-seven per cent of the new revenue that we have received has been returned to budget repair—82 per cent in this budget, but 87 per cent over our first two budgets in our first 12 months in office. That's important, because it's saving us over $80 billion over the medium term on interest repayments. To put that in perspective for members in the House, that's about twice what we spend in our Defence portfolio every year. So that's a significant saving. It's building our capacity to reinvest that in paying further debt but also to invest in capacity in defence, in infrastructure, in education and in health, in child care and in aged care—all the priorities of the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've identified $7.8 billion in spending saves and reprioritisations in this budget. That adds to what we already put away in the previous budget—close to $40 billion over the two budgets. Contrast that to the previous two budgets where the number was zero from the coalition. We're doing the hard work. I'd ask you to cast your mind back to about a month ago when the opposition leader gave his speech in reply. He criticised Labor for expending but added around $10 billion to coalition spending through a combination of new spending commitments and dangling things in front of the voters' eyes and then taking them away and dangling them again, saying, for example, that he would perhaps, maybe, continue but then saying, 'I didn't really mean that.' Those were new initiatives announced but uncosted, so roughly $10 billion in extra spending from those on the other side. Contrast that to what we have been able to deliver, significant savings and improving the budget bottom line. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a couple of other things. This budget is focused on ensuring that we can rebuild the capacity of the Public Service. There have been lots of examples lately of why that is needed, and I look forward to the opportunity of saying more about that in the near future. </span>

Really? Despite the fact they are spending $185 billion, this is a budget that says economic growth is going to fall, unemployment is going to rise and yet they are spending an extra $185 billion. I don't reckon that is a particularly good budget, and why it not a good budget? Because we are seeing everyday Australians hurting as a result of the inaction and failure of this government to address the issues that are facing everyday Australians. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interest rates have increased again since the budget, for the 11th time since this government took office. We have seen grocery prices rising, fuel prices not coming down, grocery and electricity prices increasing. Despite all they want to say about electricity prices, the one thing they can't say and they haven't repeated since the election is that they are going to reduce your power bill by $275. It is nowhere—nowhere—to be seen. It has disappeared in a mirage. An increase is an increase, and maybe the increase wasn't as high as it would have otherwise been. But it is still an increase, and I can tell you that for people in Queensland their electricity bills are going to go up by another 20 per cent on 1 July. What is this government doing to deal with that? It is doing nothing. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been 12 months since they have taken office, and we are yet to see them roll up their sleeves and actually get stuck in and deal with some of the issues that are facing this country. Mortgage holders, renters, small businesses, all sections of our economy are facing the pressures of higher electricity prices and higher input costs, and they are struggling to make ends meet. First home buyers are seeing their dream of ever being able to own their own home slowly slip away. No matter how hard they save, it is one foot forward, two steps back. The Australian dream is slowly becoming a distant dream. Consumer sentiment and business confidence are sitting at recessionary levels. The NAB's monthly business survey along with the Westpac-Melbourne Institute's consumer sentiment survey both show that the household sector remains exceptionally downbeat. That is not a particularly strong endorsement of the budget that was only handed down five or six week ago. As I look at my local electorate, I see the work that our great community organisations are doing to cover for those. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My questions to the minister are: after three separate quarters of inflation, why did the government deliver a budget that included $185 billion of additional spending, rather than reducing spending to combat out-of-control inflation? With inflation out of control under Labor, why did the government decide to remove the words 'The immediate priority is to ensure fiscal policy is not adding to inflationary pressures and to begin budget repair' from the budget's fiscal strategy?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After repeatedly criticising the coalition for funding measures for a set period of time before a review or re-evaluation of the process, isn't it true that Labor's budget does exactly the same thing for policies including: the escaping violence payment; supporting families impacted by violence and at risk of engaging in the child protection system; funding for the Australian Breastfeeding Association's National Breastfeeding Helpline; and funding for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder prevention, among many others? As I said at the outset, this is a budget full of smoke and mirrors, a complete mirage, and does nothing to deal with the issues facing the Australian people. I look forward to the minister's answers to those questions.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  It's with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2023-2024, given the strong budget that I'm able to speak about in this session. When this government came to office, it inherited a situation where inflation was on the rise due to a range of global factors. There was the illegal and immoral invasion of the Ukraine by Russia, which clearly had a significant impact on energy and food prices and their volatility, and of course there were also supply chain issues that were still impacting globally as a result of the overhang of COVID. What we inherited was a situation where inflation had already started rising—indeed, the largest single quarterly increase had already occurred—under the watch of the previous government. Interest rates had already started increasing under the watch of the previous government. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those from the other side who want to ask questions about our budget, a little bit of self-reflection might be in order when, notwithstanding the fact that all of these issues were in existence, their last budget when in office had zero dollars in saves. They come in here and talk about spending when in fact there's been a gargantuan turnaround under this government—a projected $80 billion deficit turned into a surplus, which is the right response for the times. Under their last budget, there were zero dollars in saves. They handed over to this government $1 trillion in Liberal debt, and this government, through very responsible fiscal management, is paying that off, which will have benefits over the medium and longer term.</span>

                    </a>  Let's ask: what is at the heart of this budget? At the heart of this budget is responsible management of the fiscal position and, at the same time, reasonable, proportionate, well targeted cost-of-living relief. It's absolutely critical that we have both of those components to the budget. On the one hand, we have cost-of-living relief, which includes energy relief for households, rental relief for households, strengthening Medicare, a substantial increase in the bulk-billing incentive and a substantial pay increase for those working in the aged-care sector. We've also moved to strengthen industrial relations protections. We've seen increases in wages for those most vulnerable, which those opposite fought against tooth and nail. They said it would destroy the economy. It clearly hasn't. We have all of these critical measures that are absolutely essential at this time for the most vulnerable—a measured, appropriate, cost-of-living package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time as putting that in place, we've managed a substantial turnaround in the budget situation, a change in the fiscal position, which is absolutely critical if we're going to be successful in the fight against inflation. As I mentioned before, the forecast for 2022-23 was for a nearly $80 billion deficit, and now we have a forecast of a $4.2 billion surplus. </span>

                    </a>  How did we achieve that? Well, of the short-term fiscal upgrades, 87 per cent were returned over the past two budgets. Again, that's significantly more than those opposite. The volume of interjections reflects nothing more than their embarrassment at their time in government. I take it as a compliment that those opposite arc up when faced with the facts. It's embarrassing for the previous government that they returned so little to the bottom line, which is exactly what was driving the substantial increase in debt. But at an 87 per cent return to the bottom line, the tax upgrades over the last two budgets are going to significantly help in the battle against inflation, which is what we have at the centre of our policy, and what must be at the centre of our policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned before, savings identified by this government are at the heart of the fiscal strategy. There were $17.8 billion in savings in the last budget. Added to savings in the October budget, this totals $39.8 billion over two budgets. As well, there is restraint, limiting average real spending growth to 0.6 per cent over the five years to 2026-2027. If we look at the budget in a holistic sense, it has the savings, it has the fiscal repair and it has the return of the short-term fiscal uplift to the budget bottom line. That has seen a massive turnaround in the bottom line of the budget but, at the same time, responsible, targeted, well-designed cost-of-living relief, which is absolutely critical for those most vulnerable. So the government is fighting inflation, as it should, but in a careful way.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  Before I get into what I want to talk about, I should remind the member for Fraser that this government inherited $514 billion. ABC fact-checked budget papers will confirm that. Thirty per cent of that came from the Rudd-Gillard years, so there were lots of claims there that weren't true. I don't have enough time to go through them all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the future of work is changing and, as a nation, we need to invest in creating the jobs of the future. To get there, we need to create fertile ground for the entrepreneurs of today and tomorrow. Our small and medium sized businesses are contributing strongly to this entrepreneurial spirit. They are responsible for 57 per cent of Australia's GDP, for employing seven million Australians and for providing 70 per cent of private sector employment. They will play a key role in creating the entrepreneurially inspired jobs of the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The spirit of Australia attracts global talent. Investors appreciate our mix of hard work, friendliness and stability as a nation. We're also a tech-powered economy. Classified as a single industry, Australia's outsized technology sector is now the third-largest contributor to GDP in Australia, at $167 billion. We are tech-hungry consumers who embrace innovation. This makes us early adopters who are open to change. It also makes us a great market to trial and pioneer new digital services. Our technical skills and technological proficiency are evident in global rankings. We are ranked fourth in the world for digital consumption, and fintech is an ultrafast-growing sector. In addition, the Productivity Commission's five-year productivity inquiry this year found 'digital technology and data have the potential to significantly improve Australia's productivity'. This highlights the opportunity missed by this Prime Minister in not appointing a minister for the digital economy. It shows a prime minister out of touch with the modern Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only have the government missed a huge opportunity in having no minister; the recent budget put the brakes on tech startup opportunities, with the government quietly pulling funding from programs that support innovation and entrepreneurship. The Accelerating Commercialisation program, which provided up to $1 billion in matched funding to commercialise technologies, has been shut down. The Entrepreneurs' Program, which provided expert advice, support and funding for startups and small businesses, has closed. All staff have been let go. The Boosting Female Founders Initiative, which provided $255,000 to $500,000 to female-founded startups, has frozen applications. This program provided targeted support on a coordinated basis to female founders of startup businesses to scale into domestic and global markets. The program also offered expert mentoring and advice to a select number of eligible applicants. It helped to stimulate private sector investment into innovative startups led by women and helped women entrepreneurs overcome barriers to accessing the finance and support necessary to scale their startups. The Manufacturing Modernisation Fund, which provided up to $1 million for SMEs to transform manufacturing practices with new technologies, has frozen applications. While some of the funding is earmarked to be redirected through a newly announced industry growth program, details are scant and the program won't launch until late 2023 at best.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A new program, a new executive, a new independent review committee and a new set of eligibility criteria are all very well for the government's desire to make its mark and cut ribbons. But it ultimately leaves startups and SMEs in the lurch. Startups don't have the luxury of time to wait around for governments to get their programs launched. Many were in the middle of application processes, only to be unceremoniously notified that the whole program was shutting down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor government just does not understand that, in a sector where uncertainty is a constant, governments are most helpful when they can provide stability—in policies, sources of funding and tax incentives to invest in entrepreneurship. It is clear that the Prime Minister and Treasurer don't understand the modern economy. It's not just the tech sector that suffers; all Australians do, through lost economic growth and productivity gains. The question for the minister is: 'Did the Department of Finance cost any new digital economy policies that the government did not proceed with?' because we have seen, with this budget, that there is no plan to support the digital economy, drive economic growth and drive productivity, to drive benefits for all Australians.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  I appreciate the opportunity to speak in relation to the Finance portfolio and the budget. In the course of my work as a member of the House Economics Committee, together with the member for Hawke and the member for Forde, I have had cause to seek the advice of many people and organisations, both within and outside government. I would like to reflect on some of those meetings and the importance of having that valuable input from people working at the coalface. The Economics Committee, as part of its ambit, reviews the RBA, APRA, the ACCC and ASIC. A large number of organisations interface with one or more of those bodies. I have met, a few times now, with people like Alan Kirkland, the CEO of Choice. Some of us only turn to Choice for a tip when we're buying a new washing machine, but the organisation is a fierce advocate across a broad sweep of consumer issues, including credit traps, personal data protection, the regulation of tech platforms and, saliently, the question of market competition, into which the committee has an ongoing inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I met with Bruce Billson, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, who was previously the Liberal member for Dunkley and a minister, including the Minister for Small Business. Apart from his role ministering to small business owners, Mr Billson—and his organisation, too—is active in advocacy, with submissions across areas including bank closures, digital platforms and payment systems. Most recently, Mr Billson made a submission to the inquiry into promoting economic dynamism, competition and business formation. His bird's-eye view on the effect of the budget and of regulation on business is an invaluable input.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier on in the term, I was fortunate to meet with Rita Battaglin of Financial Counselling Australia. It was important to have distilled for me the way in which difficult and different financial pressures are affecting people in their day-to-day lives. My own electorate of Hasluck has 53 per cent of residents paying a mortgage and a further 18 per cent renting, so any increase in financial pressure will quickly be felt by my constituents. Ms Battaglin was able to inform me of the difficulties caused by the lack of regulation in the buy-now pay-later space, among other matters, and has invited me to sit in with a financial counsellor in their workplace in Hasluck—an offer I'm scheduled to take up very soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, I have met with the unions—the SDA, the TWU, the AWU, the CPSU and others. If a union delegation wants to meet with me, I am there, and, if it's been too long, I get in touch with them. Unionists work every day with the difficulties faced by their members, across many industries. They know firsthand the needs and obstacles governments can assist with. There is power in the union, and there is also a wealth of experience. It is a great boon to the ALP, and I would recommend to all members in this place to have their door open to union representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I started by referring to a few of the outside organisations that I have taken advice from—and there have been many others—is that, when we seek to govern for people, we need to know what their needs are. We can't pretend to know. And we can't just read a book and adopt some flaky ideological stance. We are here to govern for Australians, and we must value the living conduits to their daily lives. Armed with these views, from people who are all working in different spaces, I'm better able to fulfil my role on the committee and to consider legislation as it comes to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also engaged, listened and, both before and through the budget, has embarked on an impressive course of financial reform. Just yesterday was the announcement that the government will adopt most of the recommendations in the quality-of-advice review. This will mean better advice going forward and is particularly important as we see the average super amounts people retire with increasing over the next decade or so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget there is substantial provision for combating online scams, which are set to become only more insidious. There is $58 million to establish the National Anti-Scam Centre with the ACCC, $17.6 million and $4.4 million ongoing for ASIC to address phishing and investment scams, and $10.9 million and $2.2 million ongoing to establish an SMS ID register. I was very grateful to the minister for joining me, together with the member for Swan and Senator Fatima Payman, in Forrestfield, where we had a forum of over 100 people very concerned about this. Listening to, understanding and responding to those issues is exactly what this government is delivering for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also introduced payday super. I met with a number of representatives of the superannuation industry in recent months and, as a small business owner myself, I'm happy to support this long-overdue change. This change will take effect from 1 July 2026, allowing ample time to adjust and therefore reduce noncompliance. Again, the Australian government is listening and responding, and we're grateful for the work that you're all doing.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  I want to take this opportunity to ask a question of the minister. What measures, particularly included in the budget, are there for hardworking small business operators to make their lives easier and to address the cost-of-living challenges as they present through the agrifood supply chain? I think you share my view, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we hear too infrequently in this place from people at the coalface, and so I thought I'd read into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> a few emails I've received on this topic so that people can understand what is actually happening to the costs in the food supply chain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first email comes from Nigel Rollbusch, of Rollbusch Quality Meats at Barmera and Waikerie. 'Hi Tony. My power bill has increased 50 per cent within 12 months. At our Barmera shop, we have put a 30-kilowatt solar on the roof and we're trying to grow our business into small goods, but, as a high user of electricity, we can't afford this increase. We're trying to be competitive locally and nationally and even looking to export, but we need cheaper power. We currently employ 14 employees and are looking to grow this with four apprentices, two school based and two third-years, with another couple in sight. We're doing our best to support local kids with jobs, but our inputs are ever-increasing and I can't increase our prices without losing customers. If the current government want to reduce unemployment, how about giving higher-using businesses power relief so we don't fall over? Small business can't soak up any more. Small business needs help to grow.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's Stephen Noble. Stephen is part of a family business. They're private irrigators in the Riverland. He goes on to say: 'We operate a fourth-generation enterprise growing wine grapes, citrus and almonds in the Riverland. We did have an ongoing power supply agreement with Origin which expired on 28 February this year. The lowest off-peak rate is for a three-year term at 17.249c per kilowatt-hour. Tony, that's an increase of 542 per cent—totally unacceptable. For many irrigators, the power increases may be enough to send them "out the back door". The management aspect of timing when to irrigate becomes much more of an issue due to power cost spikes which can literally be eye-watering: up to $15,000 per kilowatt and higher.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Josh Clark, a dairy farmer at Mil-Lel, said: 'I'm on a dairy farm just out of Mount Gambier. It's a family owned, third-generation business. Our two-year contract on demand was due for renewal in December last year. We use around 500,000 kilowatt-hours. We received a renewal offer and thought it was a mistake, with a massive increase in two years. Of course, I immediately went shopping around, starting with the big electricity players in South Australia. Both had a freeze on any large new business contracts. I asked why and they told me they couldn't say but suggested it had to do with unpredictable pricing. I was able to get some offers from smaller players in the market who had similar pricing to Momentum, my previous provider. I went back to them reluctantly and simply explained that we have seen significant increases not only in electricity but also in other inputs—diesel and fertiliser have all gone up.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there was the much-publicised Nippy's Fruit Juices in my electorate, a third-generation, family-owned business from Barker facing a 92.5 per cent price increase for their energy costs. That's more than $900,000 that will need to ultimately be borne by consumers. That's the point. Each individual I mentioned here—Rollbusch Quality Meats in Barmera and Waikerie, Stephen Noble from Riverland Blocks, Josh Clark, a dairy farmer at Mil-Lel, and Nippy's are involved in producing things that end up on our supermarket shelves. They're heavy users of electricity, and the prices they need to pay are simply unsustainable. There are two options those opposite need to consider: either these small businesses go out of business and we eat food that comes from overseas, or the costs are passed onto consumers, which is why consumers are facing the pain they do as they wheel their trolleys down the supermarket aisle. So my question to those opposite is: what supports are in your budget for hardworking small businesses?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:16</span>):  It is galling but unsurprising to sit here and listen to the Liberals opposite continue to crabwalk away from their own responsibility when it comes to a decade of economic mismanagement, waste, wasted opportunities, wasted public resources, wasted money and wasted taxpayer money. They have left Australian taxpayers with $1 trillion of Liberal debt. It is an utterly disgraceful circumstance and incredibly irresponsible fiscal management. The worst part about that terrible trillion dollars of Liberal debt that they've left is that there is no economic dividend for this country. There is no economic dividend for the trillion dollars that they wasted on car parks and regional pools in city areas. It's just so disappointing. They come in here after 12 months—the Australian public are not mugs. I know that those from the Liberal Party think that working people don't understand matters of complex policy—they're wrong. They might not have gone to the fancy schools that you lot went to, but the reality is that working people know full well that the economic challenges that our country faces are largely driven by overseas forces—specifically, a war in Europe that is a tragic and an illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia. And the Albanese Labor government has worked very hard to support our friends in Ukraine. The issue around energy pricing is driven by supply-side challenges as a result of the war in Europe. The Reserve Bank governor has been clear about this: those international pressures and those pressures that are beyond any fiscal policy control are responsible for roughly 75 per cent of inflation in our country right now. Seventy-five per cent of inflation in our country is driven by a war in Ukraine and other factors that are outside of our control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have been out of government for 12 months. They spent a decade in government, wasting $1 trillion of Australian taxpayer money, and they come in here and have the nerve to suggest that they have the answers, 12 months after being removed in office—rightly—by the Australian people. They have all the answers all of a sudden! No one's buying it, because it is the same old story from those opposite. It is all criticism and nothing constructive. There's nothing constructive to be put here. Australians are facing really significant economic challenges, and the member for Barker is right—the price of energy is chief amongst them. But the price of energy is being driven by an illegal war in Ukraine, perpetrated by Russia. Everybody across the other side knows that. Pretending otherwise does a great disservice to both our economy and the people that rely upon it. The 25 per cent of inflation that remains on the demand side is a complex challenge to face, notwithstanding that, in fact, in some instances the Reserve Bank governor has suggested that some inflation is requisite for a growing economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the Liberal Party, who spent a decade suppressing wages. The Liberal Party are upfront—and I give that to them; they're upfront—about the fact that they fundamentally believe in lower pay for working Australians. They are now trying to make the case, along with their mates across the various shady right-wing corners of the universe, that growing wages are the issue with inflation in Australia. It is quite clear that the lowest paid workers in the Australian economy, who are getting modest pay rises, are not driving inflation. In fact, real unit labour costs are six per cent lower today than they were before the pandemic. So, for those who come in here wanting to make ridiculous arguments suggesting, after a decade of economic mismanagement on their part that left our country and Australians with $1 trillion of Liberal debt, that they somehow have the answers, that they are blessed with the public policy ideas that they had a decade to implement and couldn't: that suggestion is utterly ridiculous, and the Australian people can see right through it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  My question relates to the work that the Minister for Finance and her department are doing to futureproof our economy. With joint oversight of investment funds like the Future Fund, which is Australia's version of a sovereign wealth fund, I'm keen to better understand the work being done in the department to ensure a future focused economy for all Australians. To be in a position where Australia's social security system, unemployment and underemployment, the cost-of-living crisis and the housing crisis are pushing more and more Australians into poverty is not a proud place to be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disadvantage in Australia is very real, including in my electorate of North Sydney. Recently, I heard from a young person who can't afford ongoing help for their mental health because they are already having to choose between groceries and essential service bills. I've heard from a mother who is worried her daughter cannot afford to move out of home. I've heard from an unemployed person on the disability service pension and the National Disability Insurance Scheme who's unable to access a GP with little to no out-of-pocket charges. I've heard from a local pharmacist who is sincerely concerned that his business will need to close or that he will at least need to fire two of his three pharmacists. I've heard from a self-funded retiree who receives no concessions and only lives with cost increases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These personal experiences, shared from within my community across all stages of life—whether it is a young single worker, working families, small business owners, social security recipients or retirees—paint a picture of policy settings which seemingly insist on pitting generations against each other so that one generation wins and the next generation loses. Like most developed countries, Australia's population is ageing because of sustained low fertility and increased life expectancy. This has resulted in proportionally fewer children in the population and a larger proportion of people aged 65 or over. Working-age Australians, as a group, are net contributors to the budget. They pay more in taxes than they receive in either welfare benefits or spending. The contributions support older Australians, who then, having contributed earlier in life, take a lot more out in spending and pension payments than they contribute in taxes in their later life stage. Today's working-age Australians then, of course, anticipate that the generation after them will support them in the same way as they age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But support through the tax and transfer system from the working population to children and older people is no longer delivering generational improvements in living standards. Instead, we are seeing wealth becoming more concentrated in older Australians and younger Australians being weighed down by not just the physical burden of real debt but the mental despair that comes with that realisation. Because of the ageing of the Australian population, young workers are being required to shoulder an accelerated share of the burden of financing government spending, an increasing proportion of which will benefit the nonworking, low-tax-paying older generations. At the same time many in the younger generations are struggling to find secure, well-paid jobs and secure, affordable housing, while many in older generations risk not receiving the support they need because government after government has failed to plan over the long-term on an intergenerational timescale. Many young workers are also having to pay off student loans. They are finding it almost impossible to buy a home, and they are going to have to deal with the rapidly growing costs of climate change. In truth, there was very little in the budget for young working Australians. There was no relief from rising university debt, there was little support for those struggling with their mental health and there was underwhelming action to meet the challenge of climate change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through it all it is most often young Australians who feel the financial distress most acutely, and there is ultimately little in this budget for those who have finished studying and started paying taxes. To address this intergenerational inequity and keep our economy future focused, we must get our macroeconomic policy settings right. The government must revisit the long list of productivity enhancing reforms advanced by federal and state productivity commissions to boost the long-term living standards. Tackling intergenerational inequity and poverty requires a whole-of-system approach addressing activity, productivity and wages, and will require the government to do some heavy lifting. Instead, we have been given a budget that has done little to offend but even less to drive a future-focused economy through reform. My question to the minister then is: what work is the department doing to overcome the vastly different impacts the government's policy settings have on the financial security of different generations and plan for the long-term intergenerational timescale? </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  I thank the members for their questions and their engagement on this important area of government expenditure. One of the things that has been raised in parliamentary debates but has also been raised outside of this building is in relation to government capacity, its contracting arrangements and what the government is doing to ensure we build up our capacity as a government but also that we draw down our capacity on outsourcing arrangements and revisit some of those relationships that we have of contractors and service providers. We got elected on a platform to bring more of the core work of the Public Service back inside the Public Service because we thought that over a decade the capacity of the Public Service had been run down, particularly in an area of core policy-making. But it was not just core policy-making; there were unacceptable levels of outsourcing and labour hire reliance, even in core areas of government service delivery such as the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Defence and the Centrelink service delivery area. We have started to bring that work back in. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PwC scandal has been an appalling shock to all of us, and Australians are rightly outraged at what has been revealed on that. In response, the Minister for Finance together with the Treasury portfolio ministers have initiated a raft of responses, some of them provided for within the budget. Within the Finance portfolio, the immediate and direct response was a request to PwC itself that any employees engaged directly or indirectly with the scandal in relation to the tax advisory matters be stood down from any Commonwealth government work. We have inserted new clauses into our contracting arrangements, which place not only a value for money but an ethics test in the contracts. It's pretty clear that an employee or a business that has been involved in the sort of abuse of information and privilege that was revealed in the PwC tax advice scandal would not be eligible for those sorts of contracts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, we are enhancing the capacity of the Tax Practitioners Board. An additional $30 million has been provided to build up its capacity to ensure that it can properly investigate the sort of unethical behaviour that was uncovered in the Collins matter. We are also enhancing its powers. There is a bill before the Senate at the moment. It hasn't passed through, and I urge the coalition parties to back the action that the government is taking to improve its capacity to go after unethical and rogue behaviour such as was involved in the Collins matter, to ensure that proper sanctions can be put in place in relation to that behaviour. All of this important job of work is responding not only to the over-reliance on outsourcing but to the rogue and abhorrent behaviour that was exposed in the PwC matter.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time remaining, I will respond to some of the questions that have been raised. The member for Barker asked what we're doing to support small business. He might have waited for the energy price relief. Over a million small businesses throughout the country will be receiving energy bill price relief. He voted against it. We voted for it. We think small businesses deserve this relief. The $20,000 instant asset write-off provisions and the Small Business Energy Incentive are, again, providing support for small businesses, together with, frankly, sound energy policy and sound workforce policy, with the training of more apprentices—something that they fell asleep on on their watch.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Forde and the member for Casey asked us to spend more and tax less—to do more and to do less. They've supported every one of our spending initiatives—except for the energy price relief, I should say, and except for the very sound 60-day dispensing policy, which will save consumers and the government more and ensure that consumers are paying less for their medicines. It is extraordinary that they've decided to oppose that. I've been asked by the member for North Sydney— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  I am pleased to join the consideration in detail today for Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2023-2024. A centrepiece of the Albanese Labor budget has been an historic investment in health and aged care. But before the back and forth about the why and the how, I want to bring in the voices of those who are not in this room. In Wollongong, Dr Catherine told me: 'Because of this budget, it's perhaps the first time in a long time that we've had cause for optimism.' In Weston, Dr Yasas said: 'It's been a lifeline thrown at us with the budget.' Across the country there were practices that were on the verge of moving away from bulk-billing for good. This budget has halted that. But I'm even more pleased to hear already that many practices will now return to bulk-billing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many Australians it has never been harder or more expensive to see a GP. The cost of health care continues to rise, yet investment has not kept pace. Our budget changes that. The 2023-2024 budget provides an historic $6.1 billion investment in Medicare and a $3.5 billion investment to triple the bulk-billing incentive. It will support free appointments for 11.6 million Australians. The budget also includes indexation of more than $1.5 billion to boost Medicare rebates, delivering the biggest increase in 30 years. More than 300 medicines will now be more affordable for six million Australians. This will mean fewer visits to GPs, saving time and money. The investment in the budget will strengthen Medicare as the foundation of universal health care. It will boost bulk-billing and restore primary care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is another step towards the Albanese government's commitment to restore dignity in aged care. It will mean older Australians are treated with the respect they deserve, underpinned by an investment in aged care of $36 billion in 2023-24. Our government recognises and values aged-care workers, which is why we're investing $11.3 billion to fund the Fair Work Commission's interim decision for a 15 per cent pay increase. Aged-care workers deserve more than thanks. This budget continues our ambitious aged-care reform and puts the health, wellbeing and dignity of older Australians at the centre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen is barriers for too many Australians seeking mental health care and support, including bottlenecks in the psychology training pipeline, with too few psychologist to meet the growing demands of our communities right around Australia. With a $586.9 billion investment, the government is addressing workforce shortages, extending critical services, addressing urgent gaps and laying the groundwork for future reform to the mental health and suicide prevention system. This budget continues support for Australia's culturally and linguistically diverse communities through a $134.8 million investment over four years for the world-renowned program of assistance for survivors of torture and trauma. Since coming to government, we have already made mental health care more affordable and more accessible, and these measures will mean that more Australians can access the care that they need and that they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia had some of the lowest rates of smoking in the world, but big tobacco has launched a concerted campaign to create the next generation of nicotine addicts. Vaping has become a gateway into smoking, even though vapes were sold to us as therapeutic products to help people quit. The budget funds strong action to reduce smoking and vaping rates, particularly amongst young Australians, through stronger legislation, enforcement, education and support. The measures in this budget will protect more Australians, particularly young people, from the addiction and long-term health consequences associated with smoking and vaping. Existing controls will be strengthened to reduce the significant health risks of vaping, especially for children and young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is about the positive change to health that Australians have been calling for, that is long overdue and that Australians right around the country have desperately needed and wanted. It will improve the health care of Australians and reduce the pressure on their hip pocket. I am proud to support this budget.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  I appreciate the remarks of the assistant minister, but I'm very disappointed—we are very disappointed—that the minister is not here. When I was a minister, I always attended consideration in detail in the Federation Chamber; I think it's a critical matter of respect for the parliament and its processes, particularly around the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are, as a coalition, strongly committed to improving the health, safety and wellbeing of Australians and ensuring that all Australians have affordable access to the health care they need across the country. We understand that our healthcare system should be equitable and accessible to all Australians, no matter their postcode. As we stated, we will support good policy put forward by this government. But, equally, we will not hesitate to hold them to account when we think they should be doing better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that basis, a measure that certainly has our support is the provision of $16.8 million to introduce new MBS items for EndoPredict tests that determine a patient's risk of recurrent breast cancer. We know that genetic testing is a critical way to increase early diagnosis of breast cancer and to increase breast cancer prevention for at-risk women. So this is a great women's health item for the MBS. The extension of the Medicare health checks was also a welcome inclusion in this budget. The coalition introduced these items to Medicare when in government, to ensure Australians had affordable and timely access to heart-health screening and advice. So I commend the government for listening to the sector, to the peak bodies and to the coalition's advocacy on this matter and deciding not to remove Medicare-funded heart-health checks for Australian patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we are concerned that, although there is significant funding that has been included in this budget for the health portfolio, the lack of an urgent or comprehensive workforce strategy puts the effective implementation of Labor's health measures into serious doubt. Workforce shortages are undoubtedly the most pressing issue currently facing our healthcare system, and we know that they are putting pressure on access in rural and regional and remote communities. Minister, do you accept that measures like increasing the bulk-billing incentive will not be effective if the current workforce crisis is not urgently addressed? How will Australians have access to bulk-billed consults if they cannot get access to a GP in the first place?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another glaring omission was the lack of additional access to mental health support provided by this budget, which is particularly concerning given that the government has slashed Medicare-subsidised psychology sessions in half. Minister, what has your government introduced to increase affordable access to psychology sessions, since you ripped away this critical support from vulnerable Australians?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The absence of key funding for ovarian cancer is also a concern. We were disappointed to see that the government ignored Ovarian Cancer Australia's budget submission and didn't provide this support. So, Minister, can you confirm whether the government considered the important support that Ovarian Cancer Australia's budget submission would provide to Australian women battling ovarian cancer? Why did your government choose not to support it? Will your government commit to matching the coalition's $4 million commitment for Ovarian Cancer Australia, to support their critical work? Every woman with ovarian cancer should feel as though they're supported on their journey in battling this terrible disease. I sincerely hope that they get the funding to help achieve that goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government would also allocate $5 million to review women-specific health items on the Medicare Benefits Schedule and corresponding treatments on the MBS. This review would identify what best-practice, women-specific medical services are not listed and ensure that clinically-effective services and treatments remain affordable and accessible. As our opposition leader, Peter Dutton, stated in the budget reply, we, as the coalition, do have a proud record of committing funding for endometriosis, stillbirths, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. In continuing this strong support for women's health, the opposition leader committed to investing $4 million for Ovarian Cancer Australia. That, I think, is not a great deal of funding for an incredibly important outcome for so many women. We know, having seen the investment of funding to support ovarian cancer in the past, that it actually does make a difference. It's not just for the treatments for the disease; it's for support. It's for psychosocial support. It's for helping women who are at their lowest and most vulnerable, with respect to something that, 10 years ago, was completely unrecoverable from, in the short to medium term. But now there's hope; there's light at the end of the tunnel, and I think this government has an obligation, where they see that there is that light, to lend a modest amount of money to support it. I don't understand why this health minister has ignored women with ovarian cancer and their requests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want, in the last 20 seconds, to mention pharmacy, Deputy Speaker Sharkie. I know that you actually asked a question in the House, and I know that Assistant Minister McBride is a pharmacist. I'm not going to give her a hard time about that, because I actually sense that she's not very happy with the government's position on pharmacy. I really want to say that every single pharmacist who sends me their experience and what they do for their patients and their vulnerable patients really breaks my heart.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  I just want to say how proud I am of being part of an Albanese Labor government that is resuscitating health care in this nation. In particular, I want to thank Minister Mark Butler and Assistant Minister Ged Kearney, but, in particular, Assistant Minister Emma McBride—not only the Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, and Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Health, and member for Dobell, but also one of Australia's greatest pharmacists and a proud member of team Central Coast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has committed to $3.5 billion in tripling the bulk-billing incentives. Let's go through that for a moment—the importance of primary care and our general practitioners, particularly on the Central Coast but right around the country. Primary care is about prevention, with the aim to prevent exacerbation of conditions and deterioration of a patient. I want to describe two patient journeys of patients with type 2 diabetes, and the importance of primary care—that is, general practice—in this patient population. One journey will be of the patient that has access to primary care. The other journey will be of the patient that does not have access to primary care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that most people in this chamber know what diabetes is. It's a chronic medical condition here in Australia. It's an abnormal process in carbohydrate metabolism leading to hyperglycaemia, which is high blood sugar. There is significant morbidity and mortality associated with type 2 diabetes. We can talk about the micro- and macrovascular complications, whether they be retinopathy, causing blindness; nephropathy, causing renal failure and then going onto dialysis; or neuropathy, leading to peripheral nerve damage, particularly in the legs, which leads to wounds becoming infected and then patients requiring amputation. Then we can go on to those macrovascular complications, where we look at an increased risk of stroke, increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease and the like. Initial management of that patient will include lifestyle changes—including physical activity, weight reduction et cetera—and then, potentially, going onto antihyperglycaemics and then, potentially, insulin. So that's what the disease is and that's the initial management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now let's look at the impact that primary care has on this journey from diagnosis to management. A patient who is able to access affordable primary care will be able to go to their GP, have a thorough history and physical examination undertaken and then undergo further diagnostic testing for diabetes. We look at things like the HbA1c test—that's a blood test that you get fairly frequently for diabetes—the oral glucose tolerance test and the fasting plasma glucose test. The patient will be recommended a treatment plan from there, whether that's the lifestyle modification that I was just talking about or the oral antihyperglycaemics—metformin and the like—or insulin. All of this is prevention so that the patient doesn't deteriorate or become significantly unwell and then present to the emergency department or require high levels of care in our inpatient wards or, even worse, in intensive care. Now let's talk about this same patient if they are now unable to access affordable primary care. All those clinical encounters that I just mentioned won't occur if a patient can't get in to see their GP. A patient will continue going about their daily life, either knowingly or unknowingly having elevated blood sugar levels. So they'll experience all of those complications that I've just mentioned: the hyperglycaemia, the insulin resistance—all increasing the levels of morbidity and mortality for that patient. That's why investing in primary care is so important, and that's what this government is doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just one real-world clinical scenario, so let's do a specific example in my home electorate on the Central Coast, a local example of how tripling of the bulk-billing incentive will benefit local GPs and local patients on the Central Coast. The East Gosford Medical Centre is a local GP practice with a patient load of 3,000 people. With a tripling of the bulk-billing incentive it has been reported that they will be able to bulk-bill 50 per cent of their patient load. Without this incentive that practice would have closed, meaning that 3,000 patients would have been without a GP. That would have meant 3,000 not having medications reviewed, 3,000 people not having clinical reviews for chronic illness, 3,000 people not being screened for preventable illness and 3,000 people potentially requiring emergency department care or admission to hospital. That would have been 3,000 people without a doctor, and, now that they are able to bulk-bill, they will be able to bulk-bill 50 per cent of their patient population and that practice can now remain open. This is why our changes to bulk-billing and health care are so important, and this is a positive impact of Labor health policy. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  We all want our older Australians to have the care that they need and deserve. But Labor's ill-conceived plan to go against the advice of the royal commission and expedite the 24/7 registered nurses a year ahead of what was recommended by the commission is threatening the very viability of our aged-care sector. The most pressing issue facing aged-care providers—and this has been known for several years now—is of course workforce shortages. Surely Labor gets this, but the response of the Albanese government has been to introduce legislation to make the situation worse and then deliver a budget that fails to fund the comprehensive and multifaceted workforce strategy solutions that are required. Despite her acknowledgement that the sector is 'thousands of workers short' of the staffing requirements and that we are just one month out from the government's self-imposed deadline, the minister has failed to provide any additional support or flexibility to this crucial sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Providers are calling for an exemption or some of the criteria to be expanded while the current workforce crisis is ongoing. This would give them the assurance that they need in the time that they need it, but the Albanese Labor government continues to ignore their concerns. The minister must start to listen to those she represents in the aged-care sector itself. The government is directly responsible for the closure of aged-care sector homes right across the country. This is resulting in older Australians being forced from their homes, and those who are living in rural, regional and remote Australia are being forced to move miles away from their communities, families and friends. The safety and care of older Australians must be the main priority of this government, not politics. The question for the minister is: will the government start to listen to the concerns of the aged-care providers across the country and expand the exemption criteria for 24/7 nurses? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With an ageing population, the coalition understands the need for sustainable aged care for all Australians now and for the future. As stated by the opposition leader in the budget-in-reply speech, we are committed to working constructively with government to improve the sector's sustainability. The announcement of an aged-care task force to look at the sustainability solution is a welcome development. Fittingly, this task force will be providing advice to government. However, it is deeply concerning that this very task force will be chaired by the minister herself. Surely the government knows and recognises that this is not appropriate. It will not result in genuine consultation, and will have the government not the aged-care sector as its focus. Minister, if the task force has been set up to provide genuine consultation-driven advice to government on aged-care sustainability, why did the Minister for Aged Care think it was appropriate to appoint herself as the chair? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's refusal to rule out an aged-care tax is deeply concerning and is concerning for wider Australia. The coalition stands ready to work constructively with the government on future sustainability of our critical aged-care sector, but increasing taxes is not the answer. This policy directly contradicts the government's election promise that there would be no new taxes under their watch. Minister, here's a question for you: will the government commit to keeping that promise and rule out a new aged-care tax imposed on our older Australians?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, if you look through the latest budget papers, you'll see that $2.2 billion has been ripped away from residential aged care. This indicates that the minister's continual statements that the Albanese government is expanding the number of aged-care beds doesn't add up. Minister, can you please provide and outline why the government is ripping $2.2 billion from residential aged care at a time when we have an ageing population and a crisis?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  The Albanese government is committed to improving health for all Australians, and in my electorate of Lingiari many Territorians living in the urban centres like Palmerston and in towns like Alice, Katherine and Tennant will benefit from initiatives that have been backed in by the budget. What is being undertaken is broad systemic reform. We are making medicines cheaper and making it easy for our most vulnerable to see a doctor by tripling the bulk billing incentive and establishing two urgent care clinics—one in Palmerston and the other in Alice Springs. But I particularly want to speak today about measures which will assist First Nations communities. In the first 12 months of the Albanese government, there has been approximately $1 billion invested in First Nations health initiatives, and in this recent budget there were many commitments targeted specifically at First Nations communities. There were, of course, many other general health initiatives that will significantly benefit and assist First Nations communities. Instead of rushing through a shopping list of items, which are there to be noted and are welcome, I'm going to limit myself to four things which will resonate with most Aboriginal Territorians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first one is renal health. Indigenous people in this country suffer kidney disease and failure at significantly higher levels than the general population, in particular in the Northern Territory. The extent of this problem has substantially escalated since the 1950s, pointing to the negative impact of processed foods, alcohol and more sedentary, non-traditional lifestyles. But even in individuals who have led careful and health-conscious lives, it still affects too many. An important and timely proposal driven by my good friend and Northern Territory colleague the Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health, Senator McCarthy, is the allocation of $30 million for renal services upgrades across the nation. Already additional dialysis chairs have been announced in Atitjere, which is in Harts Range in Central Australia, and Borroloola and Ti Tree, also in Central Australia. These additional chairs will make a huge difference for those families. It means that dialysis patients can access treatment in their home community rather than travelling the hundreds of kilometres to urban centres. That is being complemented by a $15 million investment in clean water infrastructure. This is the first time that there has been any money in any federal budget for clean water infrastructure. Dialysis, as we know, cannot work without clean water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue is fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. It is a tragic and insidious condition which blights the future of children without them having any say in the matter. A pregnant mother, often someone who is grappling with forces beyond her control like domestic violence or mental health issues, drinks alcohol regularly and to an excess. The child she is carrying is permanently affected, and while the sentinel physical characteristics may manifest themselves at or soon after birth, the mental and cognitive effects may take years to be fully revealed. FASD causes significant development, physical and intellectual impairment for young people, and it is disproportionately particularly prevalent in Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Central Australia, through the Central Australia plan, there will be $23.5 million in funding for health services. This will particularly focus on diagnostic and treatment services for FASD. During a meeting with the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress, the Minister for Indigenous Australians and I were told that congress were working with many families who are suffering. For the first time it has been identified that, for a lot of those families, it is their third- or fourth-generation iteration, which has never been picked up before. That is certainly going to do damage in the social services area and needs to be looked at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is money in the budget for aged care. I was particularly heartened by the funding that was in the budget that particularly will target mental health services for Aboriginal people. The budget measure to increase mental health support for First Nations people is important, particularly during this period of the referendum, which is going to have some serious impact, and its aftermath. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  First and foremost, I want to touch on the government's commitment, or lack thereof, to have in place a program to assist those who had Medicare-subsidised psychology sessions ripped away from them. In December last year the government released the Better Access initiative evaluation. Recommendation 12 noted that the sessions should not be cut for those with complex needs, yet they were axed. Why, in the most recent budget, did the minister choose not to restore the full 20 Better Access Medicare-subsidised psychology sessions in line with the report that says they shouldn't have been cut? Has the minister formally rejected recommendation 12? Was this on a budgetary basis and therefore putting the budget ahead of the wellbeing of Australians?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Among a number of commitments made in the budget-in-reply speech by the Leader of the Opposition, he outlined that a Dutton-led coalition government would restore, permanently, the 20 Medicare-subsidised psychology sessions. When speaking with mental health stakeholders right across the country, I hear that they are happy the coalition has made this announcement and commitment to mental health in Australia. It is the right thing to do. We have a mental health crisis in this country, and this government is not listening to the sector and the Australians suffering mental health issues and their families—and I particularly highlight young people in Western Sydney, who I speak to every day on this issue. There is a petition going around with over 45,000 signatures, calling on the government to return these sessions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the government took away the Better Access sessions without support in the interim until a full mental health reform plan is unveiled, why won't the government continue to bridge the gap for children, young women with anxiety, young men with suicidal ideation, mums and dads struggling to cope with cost-of-living pressures and Australians trying to move through after COVID and multiple natural disasters? Further on this, the Minister for Health and Aged Care said, on 12 May, that keeping the full Better Access sessions was 'lazy policy'. I wonder if he would characterise axing a program and not providing any support in the interim as lazy policy? That is exactly what he did. Page 140 of the 2023-24 Budget Paper No. 2 notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has provisioned funding for future mental health priorities in response to the Better Access evaluation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why isn't the amount that has been provisioned available in the budget papers? When will the amount provisioned be made publicly available? Over how many years has the funding been provisioned?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is pleasing to see in the mental health budget a further two years confirmed to extend the Commonwealth's support for psychosocial programs for those with severe mental health illnesses who are not part of the NDIS. I'm proud to have advocated on this important issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health workforce is an issue for every government. It doesn't matter what side they are on. The retention of additional psychology placements is welcomed. However, we need to do more on this front to attract and retain those employed in the mental health sector who provide care. That is why I find it astounding that the federal government is not recommitting to small funding opportunities such as funding the University of Canberra's early mental health intervention program. They run a clinical program performed by master's psychology students which helps 14- to 21-year-olds with self-harming behaviour, suicidal ideation and early signs of borderline personality disorder. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Times</span> today has reported the clinic needs just $300,000 to continue the program on a yearly basis. Under the coalition government, the program ran from July 2019, until June 2023. The Youth Coalition of the ACT has noted it is their No. 1 priority for the ACT budget. Given the Commonwealth didn't provide more funding, what are they going to do to support young people in the ACT and their commitment to skill masters students to benefit of all?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't the only mental health program on the chopping block. Uniting's Continuing to be Me program and the related @home program that were funded under the previous coalition government aren't receiving ongoing funding. In particular, the service for elderly patients with mild to moderate mental health needs in south-western Sydney will cease on 30 June. Why is the government cutting programs that help senior Australians combat mental health challenges? In sum, the mental health budget needs drastic improvement by the minister and the government. It would be helpful if the health minister, Mark Butler, were here to answer this question, but I will ask: when is the minister going to start prioritising mental health?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  Today I am delighted to speak to the Albanese Labor government's truly era-defining investments in strengthening Australia's health system that we saw in last month's budget. There is no issue more important to voters in my electorate of Boothby than health care. Access to quality, affordable health care is fundamental to a thriving society. In Australia, we know that we deliver this access through the great Labor institution that is Medicare. That's why I'm proud to be a member of this government, a government that is prioritising strengthening our health system, strengthening Medicare, at every opportunity after a decade of cuts and neglect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are doing so many important things across the health portfolio. I've spoken about many already in this place. We are tripling the bulk-billing incentive, delivering the largest ever increase, meaning more Australians will be able to see a bulk billed GP. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners called this massive investment a 'game changer' for general practice in Australia and one that is certainly needed. We are delivering cheaper medicines for six million Australians. In fact, in Boothby alone, we've already saved people more than $763,000 on over 69,000 prescriptions. We're opening more than 50 Medicare urgent care clinics around the country, including one that I'm expecting to see established later this year in Boothby. These are all essential investments that will go a long way to strengthening our health system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I want to speak about one issue that has received less attention in our health-related budget announcements. That is the investment in preventative health. The truism in public health is that $1 of prevention saves $9 in treatment. In this budget, the Albanese government is reclaiming Australia's position as a world leader in tobacco and vaping control. Everyone in this place knows that the rates of vaping, particularly among young people, have increased dramatically in recent years. I have three sons aged 23, and I've been shocked at how prevalent vaping is among their friends and people their age. Latest estimates suggest that one in six teenagers aged 14 to 17 have vaped, and that figure rises to one in four for those aged 18 to 24. Much like cigarettes were marketed to young demographics as cool or fun products before the important reforms implemented by the Keating government and since, vapes are being pushed to young Australians because an addict is a guaranteed customer, and getting them early is the business model. We know that nicotine is highly addictive and poses serious health risks, and we have strong and consistent evidence that young people who vape are three times as likely to take up smoking compared to those who don't. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the 2023-24 budget funds strong action to reduce smoking and vaping rates through stronger legislation, enforcement, education and support. The government has announced a total package of $737 million, which includes money for lung cancer screening, to tackle Indigenous smoking in a culturally appropriate manner and to support smoking and vaping cessation over four years. The government is working with states and territories to stamp out what is a growing black market in illegal vaping. We're working to stop the import of non-prescription vapes and to increase the minimum quality standards for vapes, including by restricting flavours, colours and other ingredients that are used to market them; requiring pharmaceutical-like packaging for all e-cigarettes and vapes; reducing the allowed nicotine concentration volumes; and banning all single-use, disposable vapes. Along with this, a new public health information campaign will be developed to discourage Australians from taking up smoking and vaping and to encourage more Australians to quit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of neglect and undermining by the former government, we know that there is a lot to do rebuild and strengthen our health system, and that is what Labor governments do best. We invest in the things that improve the lives of everyday Australians to ensure that access to quality, affordable healthcare is determined not by your credit card but by your green-and-gold Medicare card. With our ageing population and the increasing prevalence of chronic disease, we know that we need our health dollars to go as far as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A huge part of that is preventative health. Stopping the health problems before they progress means better outcomes for patients and helps take pressure off the health system. To do that, we need to ensure we have health services that are accessible and affordable to all Australians regardless of where they live and how much money they earn. That is the principle that underlies all of this government's investments in health.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  As the shadow assistant minister for regional health, I have many questions in this portfolio—more than time will allow today—and my questions are unashamedly focused on regional Australia, where we have poorer mortality and morbidity rates than metropolitan and suburban Australia. That is only going to get worse due to the political changes Labor made to the distribution priority areas. Rural doctors constantly tell me this has created a vacuum effect. It is not just a vacuum created in regional Australia with filling positions but an actual suction of those who were filling those gaps in regional Australia to peri-urban or outer suburban distribution priority areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question to the minister is: who did he consult prior to making the DPA change? What was the resulting impact that he saw in the regional health workforce and the subsequent increased cost to government in helping to fill the vacuum they created with locums and agency staff and the inevitability of higher—and atrocious, I might add—morbidity and mortality rates in regional Australia as a result? Was it a targeted consultation, or did they consult with, say, the Rural Health Commissioner or peak bodies representing doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, particularly those like the Rural Doctors Association of Australia and the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can the government justify the DPA policy change when the number of international doctors moving away from rural and remote areas to regional cities or peri-urban suburbs increased by 57 per cent in the first six months of this policy change? The figures show that, in the last six months of 2022, there were 72 GP movements from rural and remote areas classified as modified Monash 3 to 7 to areas categorised as modified Monash 2, which includes the larger regional cities and peri-urban centres such as Frankston or Parramatta. This is compared to 46 movements in the same six-month period in 2021 or 40 in 2020. How does the Minister for Health and Aged Care plan to rectify this disastrous outcome for rural areas so that we receive our fair share of doctors? What is the shortfall of doctors in rural areas, and what is the minister's plan to resolve this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The situation with the regional health workforce is so bad that in March I convened a regional health workforce summit in Mildura, where those at the coalface told their harrowing stories of the urgent need to mitigate the health workforce crisis. The DPA changes I mentioned earlier have only exacerbated the crisis. Will the minister for health ensure investment in regional training to increase the supply of doctors, nurses and allied health into the future?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is clearly aware of the Nationals' position on regulating vaping. Has the government modelled the human health and economic cost of its own policy versus that put forward by the Nationals?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget made significant changes for pharmacies, especially regional pharmacies, with a 60-day dispensing policy which drew pharmacists from my own electorate of Mallee, and beyond, here to Canberra in the last sitting to raise their distress about it. Did Minister Butler discuss the likely impacts of the 60-day dispensing policy with regional pharmacists? Indeed, who did the minister consult with, and where were they based? Did the government model the impact it would have on small businesses, given that regional pharmacists are telling me this policy could well force their closure, resulting in locals having to travel long distances to get their medications—if they can get them? Will the government enter a new agreement with regional pharmacists before the 60-day dispensing policy commences on 1 September, so that cost-of-living relief can be delivered without bankrupting community pharmacies?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last, but certainly not least, how will the minister guarantee that aged-care residences in rural areas can remain open? What modelling has he completed to ensure the sustainability of these facilities? Noting that the government will not reach its pledged deadline on the royal commission recommendation for 24/7 registered nurses in aged care, will the government share its modelling on the impact of its approach for that policy in regional and rural Australia? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="290544" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ANANDA-RAJAH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  My whole career was spent dealing with illness and disease in patients, and now that I am in this place I am very much focused, along with the Albanese government, on keeping people well. To that end, it means enabling people with chronic disease to take their medications. Approximately 50 per cent of the Australian population—around 11 million people—have a chronic disease, and that can range from asthma to diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, COPD, autoimmune conditions and now some cancers. It is a remarkable story of medicine that some cancers are now regarded as a chronic disease. But in order to maintain people in a state of wellbeing out of hospital, they have to be able to take their medications. These medications are costly, and it can be inconvenient to have to traipse into a pharmacist every month to get them. This is the feedback I've received from my constituents, which is why they and millions of Australians are welcoming the fact that we are determined to make medicines more affordable and more convenient for Australians, particularly those with chronic disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 September, we will be expanding the dispensation interval of medicines from 30 days to 60 days. That means that, for around 325 medications identified by PBAC, patients will be able to go to their doctor and receive a script for 60 days. This is a policy from the last government that we have dusted off. It was a policy that was initially proposed by PBAC, and the previous health minister tried to enact it but was howled down by the pharmacy sector. As a result, Australians have been paying billions extra in costs for medications for years. Australia is an outlier in this respect, compared to other advanced economies, like New Zealand, where dispensing interventions are 90 days, Canada with 100 days, and three months in France. We have opted for the more conservative estimate of 60 days. We believe that this strikes the right balance for the community and for the pharmacy sector, who are concerned at the moment around the viability because they will lose their co-payments, which in my community amounts to around $180,000 a year for some pharmacists. That is a significant amount of money, and they are justifiably concerned. However, what this means for patients is a significant saving. Those who have a Medicare card will save approximately $180 per year per medicine. That is nothing to be sniffed at. It is a significant cost-of-living saving at a time when family budgets are under intense pressure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I used to see patients who were deteriorating, particularly patients with heart failure, who often were on a fistful of medications to maintain their fluid status. They would come into hospital because they had stopped taking their medications—they had simply run out of their script. This is a common scenario. It is happening every single day in hospitals all around this country, both in regional areas where I have worked as well as in large urban centres, and it is completely avoidable. There are studies that show that, by extending dispensing for chronic medications, compliance increases by 20 per cent. That is a welcome benefit, because, when compliance increases, it means that we keep people out of hospital, and that is a positive not only for them but for our economy. There are economy wide benefits to this policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very keen to work with our pharmacy sector. Our pharmacy sector is a pillar of the health system, much like primary health care, community care, the hospital system and our aged-care system. I regard our aged-care system as being part of a wider health ecosystem. Our pharmacy sector, our community pharmacists, are a pillar supporting all of that. So every dollar of saving we make as a government will be reinvested back into the pharmacy sector to maintain their viability and to raise their scope of practice. We want to stop them from just spending their time behind that counter dispensing repeat after repeat after repeat and, instead, get them involved in more patient-to-patient care so that they can use their wisdom and their experience to help keep patients well and out of the hospital system I came from. We're also expanding the national immunisation program enabling pharmacists to vaccinate above five-year-olds, and the opioid program, which, again, will help keep people out of hospital. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  I find it passing strange that here we are talking about consideration in detail for health, aged care and sport, and the two senior ministers in this portfolio are nowhere to be seen. We have a government that have been carrying on about openness, transparency and accountability yet they can't be bothered to be in this chamber to answer the questions that the members on this side of the chamber are putting to them. I want to start off first by saying that the government made it clear in last May's budget that they are not supportive of the small-to-medium businesses, given the changes they have made to the dispensing arrangements for pharmacies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently hosted a roundtable of several community pharmacies based in my electorate for them to voice their concerns about the expected impacts. I have heard the member's contribution earlier of a $180,000 impact on some pharmacies and that is about the figure these pharmacies shared with me. But the second part of that story—that is the one that the government doesn't talk about—is that these community pharmacies, in order to keep their doors open, are going to make a range of decisions that will impact on our communities negatively. They are either going to shed staff, many of whom are women, reduce services, which will impact on members of my community, they are going to increase the cost of items in the pharmacy or they will start charging for services they presently deliver for free. So for those opposite to sit here and say this is going to save people money, they are kidding themselves. They are kidding themselves, because the Australian people will now pay more or get less service as a result of their changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is an absolute disgrace. In addition to that, as I have seen in my electorate from a discussion I have had with a non-PBS pharmacy around the opioid treatment program, again, there was no consultation—zero. These people are going to potentially close their doors and the several hundred clients they have on the opioid treatment program will have to go somewhere else or will not be able to find services. I have checked with most of my pharmacies around my electorate that do provide those services. Some will potentially take on some more clients, others will not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the other part that I want to address in this, I will ask a couple of questions on the health side. Firstly, can the minister guarantee there will be no supply issues, including shortages, to Australians for their chronic conditions? Can the minister confirm that community pharmacies will not be negatively impacted by this change? And, most importantly, will the minister provide a guarantee that no pharmacies will close because of this policy announcement negatively impacting my community? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on another matter that these portfolios cover: sport. The Minister for Sport has been quite liberal in her use of the terms 'legacy' and 'leaving a legacy for the future' over the past 12 months. When I look at the funding allocations for sport in the budget, I wonder what legacy this government actually wants to leave. Why, on 27 May, did the minister refuse the AOC's pre-budget submission request for $18.3 million to assist Olympic and Paralympic athletes in their qualification for the Paris Olympics next year? There is less than a decade to go before the Brisbane Olympic Games, and our athletes' ability to maintain their high performance standards is critical to a successful team. The government seems happy to provide $240 million for a vanity project in Hobart, but why hasn't the minister addressed the Olympic and Commonwealth games funding shortfall of $200 million per year identified across the forward estimates to 2032? It's our athletes that set the standard, and this government is letting them down. Why is the government not providing the funding necessary for our Olympians, our Paralympians and many of our other sportspeople in the minor sports to succeed and represent our country the way they truly want to?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I'd like to thank the minister for health and the two assistant ministers for health, my very good friend and colleague the member for Dobell, and my other friend and colleague the member for Cooper, for their support in getting excellent health policy into the Australian parliament after 10 years of neglect. This is a matter of philosophy. It's quite clear that the opposition does not believe in the fundamental benefits of the universal healthcare insurance program that we now call Medicare, which was originally called Medibank. Medibank was introduced by Gough Whitlam, destroyed by the Fraser government and then denied by ongoing Liberal governments until the advent of the Hawke government, who introduced Medicare, incidentally, on the same day that I started my private practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a matter of philosophy. I know there are members across the whole parliament who strongly believe in equitable access to health care and who believe in Medicare, but it's quite clear that those opposite don't. We have a Leader of the Opposition who introduced the Medicare co-payment, undermined the importance of bulk billing and undermined the importance of equitable access to health care, and this has continued. Ten years of neglectful policy has led to huge workforce problems in our general practices and huge problems in our ability to access equitable health care. I believe their neglect was ignorant and damaged Australians to a huge degree. The advent of the Albanese Labor government and the health minister Mark Butler, who are prepared to make hard decisions to act for patients to access equitable health care, has been so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the member for Mackellar, the member for Lyne, the member for Dobell, the member for Robertson and the member for Higgins understand the importance of Medicare as the basis for an equitable healthcare system. It's very important that this continues, and I'm so proud to be part of an Albanese Labor government that is continuing strengthening Medicare and providing access to health care for all Australians in an equitable manner. Bulk billing is so important. The tripling of the bulk-billing incentive in the last budget was hugely important, not only in providing patients access to equitable care but in encouraging our young doctors and our young medical students to go into general practice, which I think is most difficult health speciality, to provide that access to care for our patients. I think it's fantastic. This is just part of our $6.1 billion investment to strengthen Medicare and make it easier to see a bulk-billing doctor. It will also be easier for those with chronic health conditions to get the care they need, with the extension of the bulk-billing rates for people with chronic illness and the more prolonged consultations that they need for their health care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The heart of our healthcare system is the workforce. We've seen that they've been through some really difficult times, with COVID and with the pressures that we've had on our economy, because of course these cost-of-living pressures impact our medical practices as well, with the increasing costs of materials, staff, insurance, rent, et cetera. The fact that the Albanese government is committed to strengthening Medicare has been so important for our general practice workforce and our other healthcare workers. There have been many ups and downs, particularly during COVID, and there's much work to do, and I'm very pleased that the Albanese Labor government is continuing that work—such as the work they have done to make medicines cheaper for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, all we hear from the other side is talk from vested interests. We don't hear about patients. And patients are at the centre of the Albanese government's healthcare policy. It's about evidence based policy to strengthen health care for our patients—for the people who require health support—and it's just so important to be part of a government that is promoting that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My parliamentary colleagues, particularly those with a background in health care, are working hard to boost the health workforce across the country. This budget that we just passed in May will unlock the potential of our nurses and our midwives to provide the care Australians need, with higher rebates for nurse-practitioner-led care, and thousands of new places for students of nursing and other allied health professions in our universities, to help our workforce cope with the needs of an ageing patient population—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SCAMPS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I'd also like to make note of my disappointment that neither the Minister for Health and Aged Care, nor the Minister for Aged Care, nor the assistant health ministers, are present for this consideration in detail debate. I would like to thank the Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention for being here. But the point of this consideration in detail debate is to ask questions of those ministers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the government's $5.7 billion investment in health care is very welcome. As a doctor, I know just how neglected and underfunded our health sector was over the last decade, and it led to a healthcare system that was stressed and stretched to its limits. In particular, as the health minister himself has declared, it led to a crisis in general practice. Bulk-billing rates declined rapidly in recent years, due to the Medicare rebate freeze in place since 2014, which simply meant that rebates did not keep pace with the rising cost of running a practice. So the government's injection of $3.5 billion to triple the incentive payments for GPs to bulk-bill children, pensioners and concession card holders is a crucial health equity measure and will provide cost-of-living relief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also welcome is the $99 million over five years for the new Medicare level E item number, for consultations over 60 minutes. As a GP, I know that this will improve access for patients with complex needs. These consultations are more commonly performed by female GPs, and, like many of the feminised roles in our society, until now this vital work has been undervalued and underpaid. These measures, along with a four per cent increase in Medicare rebates through indexation, deliver a desperately-needed shot in the arm for universal health care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the budget does little to address the other key problem in general practice, and that is the shortage of GPs in Australia in both rural and urban settings. We know that people are waiting longer and longer to see a GP, and it is simply not safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The health minister himself previously dubbed the declining number of medical students pursuing general practice as the most terrifying statistic in health care. A diminishing number of young doctors are choosing to specialise in general practice because, despite being the linchpin of our health system, this profession is not valued or esteemed in the same way as other medical specialties. In response to this trend, General Practice Registrars Australia has urged the government to introduce a scheme for GP registrars to receive base-rate parity with their hospital based colleagues. So my question for the Minister for Health and Aged Care is: with GPs being the foundation of our health system and the cornerstone of multidisciplinary primary health care, will the government ensure GP registrars are paid the same as their hospital based colleagues in order to again grow GP trainee numbers?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to turn to the issue of disease prevention. We hear so often that prevention is better than cure. It is a hackneyed saying because it is so true and used so often. I do applaud the government's moves to crack down on smoking and the illegal sale of e-cigarette in this country. The targeted sale of illegally imported vapes to our children is a disgrace and must stop. I also welcome the allocation of funding for a new national lung cancer screening program. Yet the government's investment in preventive health in this budget is, at best, modest. Most strikingly, the National Obesity Strategy remains unfunded. This is despite overweight and obesity affecting two-thirds of our adult population and causing the vast majority of the chronic disease burden in this country. Each year, obesity is estimated to cost our healthcare system nearly $12 billion. Funding the National Obesity Strategy would be the most direct and effective way to improve the health of our Australian population and to relieve our stressed hospital system. My question for the health minister, then, is: will the government fund the National Obesity Strategy and, if so, when?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also suggest that expenditure on mental health in this budget is inadequate. We are facing an epidemic of mental ill-health in Australia. The task of treating such large numbers has overwhelmed our mental health services. My last question for the health minister is: will we start to fund prevention measures in mental health—firstly, initiatives such as having a social worker or a counsellor in every school in the country? </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to these very significant appropriations and, in doing so, to recognise the very significant work being done by my colleagues in the Home Affairs portfolio, Minister O'Neil and Senator Watt. Senator Watt, really, from day one, has been getting on with the very challenging work of his responsibilities in this portfolio, in addition to those in the agricultural space. We as a nation have been confronted with very significant natural disasters, and he has led from the front in coordinating the response. Critically, this has been a response that has combined dealing urgently, compassionately and effectively with Australians in need with recognising the longer term challenges. These challenges are, of course, compounded by nearly a decade of inaction when it comes to climate change. That is not something this government is continuing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to recognise the significant investments that are being made to continue his good work in the portfolio and those that are the direct responsibility of the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Cyber Security. I think all of us in question time today heard from Minister O'Neil about how critical our government's focus on cybersecurity is. It is an issue that affects every Australian—an issue that needs to be at the forefront of our response. It is an issue this government, through these appropriations and more broadly, takes with the utmost seriousness, as it does the national security dimensions of the Home Affairs portfolio and, of course, the policy leadership that Minister O'Neil is providing through the work that she is leading on the Migration Strategy. This is long-overdue work that is critical to the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That work is meaningful in and of itself, but it is particularly so because it recognises the consequences to all of us of nine wasted years. There were nine wasted years and also the period of the pandemic. The consequences of this in a modern nation that has been built on immigration cannot be overstated. Responding to these challenges—families separated, a jobs and skills crisis and an immigration system not working in concert with our domestic skilling system—was the immediate focus of the Albanese government and all of us in the Home Affairs portfolio. We have built a strong foundation for responding to this critical question of having administrative functions within the immigration department that work. I'm so pleased that, due to the work of outstanding women and men, we have gotten on top of the visa backlog. We have got our immigration system moving again. Investments in this budget continue the good work. This rests on the fantastic work of Home Affairs staff—people who understand their role, people who are committed to it, people who are also committed to and recognise the national interest in efficient visa processing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing some fantastic outcomes: in the temporary system, we're seeing turnarounds of visas in critical areas in the regions in a matter of two days; and we're also seeing very significant improvements in permanent processing, reflecting, of course, the emphasis of our government on promoting pathways to permanency, another important feature of this budget. Similarly, we have seen recognition of the critical importance of the citizenship function. I'm very pleased that now the citizenship backlog is at its lowest point in six years. Again, this is something that has come about not by accident but by focus and, of course, by considered investments, recognising the enormous value we must place on citizenship. I talked about pathways to permanency; of course, Australian citizenship is the ultimate step in that. It's something that I think all of us in this place regard as a great privilege—to be associated with that critical moment which is, often, for some people, the most critical moment in their life, that final step towards full participation in the Australian community. So I say with some pleasure but not yet satisfaction that this budget builds on those successes when it comes to enabling the pathway to citizenship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my portfolio responsibilities, there's a critically important third thing: it's Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs. I'm very pleased that we are building, through these appropriations, a deeper conversation that goes towards really recognising and harnessing the benefits of our diversity. We are the best multicultural society in the world, but we can be so much better. We have so much more work to do, and we will do that through more effectively integrating the functions of immigration, citizenship and multicultural affairs and doing more active listening with the diversity that makes up Australia. That is provided for in these appropriations.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  I welcome the fact that the minister is here, because I have a number of questions for the minister in this consideration in detail of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2023-2024. The first goes to the fact that the Labor Party and the Albanese government are overseeing a record net overseas migration of 1.5 million people. They're adding those 1.5 million to the population this year and over the next four years. My first question to the minister is: given that there will be net overseas migration of 1.5 million, why hasn't he been able to take action on the case of the Mills family, who have lived in Australia for 13 years, paid taxes and contributed to the community? Their daughter, Daisy, is an Australian citizen. Their grandfather is an Australian citizen. Why can't we get a decision which would mean that they know they have the security they've been seeking to stay here in Australia? I ask the minister as a matter of urgency to look at this case which has been raised with him.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My second question to the minister is: Australia faces a housing shortage of over 250,000 homes over the next five years. At the same time, you're allowing 1.5 million people into Australia. Where are these people going to live? What is this going to do to rents? In particular, I ask the minister: has the Department of Home Affairs raised any concerns about the impact that this record level of migration is having on the Australian housing and rental crisis? That is the second question that I would like the minister to answer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I would like him to answer, in truth and transparency: what is the cost of the government's New Zealand decision, providing permanent citizenship to 400,000 New Zealand citizens? It will see an increase in payments for government services and benefits of $1.3 billion over five years, increasing receipts by $795 million over five years. Where is the transparency around the cost of this decision, Minister?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is then the cost of TPVs and SHEVs. In the budget the cost of making 18,000 temporary protection visa holders permanent residents is estimated to increase payments for government services and benefits by $732.5 million over five years. What additional services will TPV holders be able to access that will cost $732.5 million? And the reason we want some transparency about this is that if you add the New Zealand decision and the decision around TPVs and SHEVs, they will cost, together, $1.2 billion. Is that correct? And will you provide a breakdown of those costs?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My next question goes to the impact of the TSMIT on regional employers. I've been approached by a regional business in Victoria, with 15 overseas workers. With the TSMIT changes the wages bill for the business will increase by 30 per cent. Has the department done any modelling on the impact that these TSMIT changes will have, particularly on businesses within the aged care sector, and other care providers, in rural and regional Australia?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My last question is: is the minister going to replicate the aged-care industry labour agreement across the board, into other sectors? This agreement, of which we have never seen the like in this nation before, actually tells employers what they have to say when they meet with unions and employees and sets new precedents in destroying productivity in this nation. Will this be copied into other sectors, and will it be replicated in the same fashion in these sectors? They're the questions that I would like the minister to answer.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  I do thank the member for Wannon for his extensive list of questions. It's a shame that he never asked his own government some of those questions. The family that you mentioned, and your desire to give them that security of being able to stay in Australia—it's just a shame that your government failed to do that for so many temporary workers. In a sense, you created a guest-worker system in this country with policies your government introduced. So why weren't you asking them the questions that you're asking now?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is now a majority migrant nation, and for the first time in our history more than 50 per cent of residents were born overseas or have a parent that was born overseas. We are the first English-speaking nation to have a migrant majority. We are a beacon for countries around the world, and we are often described as a multicultural success story, albeit one with a painful and difficult past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The dismantling of the White Australia policy and the embrace of multiculturalism in Australia was decades in the making, and in this federal parliament we have a new cohort of parliamentarians that better reflect multicultural Australia: me, as the member for Reid, a proud Chinese Australian; the member for Fowler, a refugee from Vietnam; the members for Holt and Higgins whose families are from Sri Lanka; Senator Payman, an Afghan Australian; and on it goes. This is the most culturally diverse parliament we have ever had, a parliament that truly reflects and represents the communities in which we live. That is only possible because we had policies that welcomed migrants from around the world, policies that allowed them and their families to settle down and build a life here, to become Australian citizens. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Minister for Home Affairs has previously said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's historic migrant success is rooted in permanency and citizenship. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But those opposite sought to whittle down our migration system, which was dominated by a large temporary migration program, workers who had no pathway to permanency or citizenship. It was a system that sometimes led down dark paths of migrant worker exploitation and the undercutting of wages for Australian workers. It was a migration system that let down businesses in need of skilled workers. It let down migrants, and it let down Australians. Under the previous government, we were left with an alphabet soup of various visa classes and subclasses. The complexity was a bureaucratic nightmare. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be part of a government that is reforming our broken migration system so that it will make Australia more secure and prosperous. By the end of this year all temporary skilled workers will have a pathway to permanent residency. Let's be clear here: this is not an expansion of our capped permanent program. It will not mean more people. What it does mean is we will be giving temporary workers an opportunity to apply to be permanent residents. While we talk about migrants in the abstract, we should never forget this is a very human issue. This discussion makes me think about Charmine Acob from the Philippines. I met her at the Chiswick Manor Care Community, an aged-care facility in my electorate. She came to Australia more than a decade ago to study nursing. During that time she picked up part-time work as a cleaner at Chiswick Manor. She worked in various roles there throughout her degree, and, once she graduated, she continued working aged-care facility but as a qualified registered nurse. She is now a permanent resident in Australia, and we are better for it. Charmine's story demonstrates the best of our migration system, a system we are determined to restore so that the next chapter of the Australian multicultural story continues to be one of success. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOOD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  My questions are directed to the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs who has joined us here today in the Federation Chamber, and I think it would be unfair for another Labor member to answer these questions because they very much relate to issues raised by the Afghan community directly with me. Why is the government scrapping a crucial visa program, the locally engaged employee visa program, otherwise known as the LEE program, for Afghans who worked for Australia, including interpreters who supported Australian soldiers? Why is Labor betraying Afghan interpreters who put their lives and even their families at risk to support Australian soldiers during the Afghan deployment? Why has the government abandoned processing refugee applications for potentially thousands of people trapped in Afghanistan? Do they now need to flee Afghanistan and enter the neighbouring countries of Iran and Pakistan, for example, to have their visas processed? Does this mean that the thousands of Afghans currently trapped in Afghanistan must either face remaining there under the Taliban rule or undertake a dangerous trip across the border? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just for background, the previous coalition government created this crucial LEE visa program to protect Afghans who supported our troops. After Labor promised the world to Afghan communities during the election campaign, this is how they are treated. The previous coalition government evacuated around 4,600 Afghan refugees in a few days and committed to a strong humanitarian intake of Afghan nationals with around 31,500 visas processed, and I understand this will also be hopefully honoured by the new government. Many Afghan families are still waiting to be reunited with loved ones, and Labor is crushing their hopes until they get some answers. The Department of Home Affairs has stated that anyone in Afghanistan it does not consider a priority—to be honest, everyone over there should be a priority—will have their applications refused. It says it cannot carry out background checks since the Islamic group reclaimed the country in August 2021. This leaves thousands of Afghans trapped in Afghanistan who now must either remain or flee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My second minor question for the immigration minister is around the Local Multicultural Projects grant opportunity opened on 7 February 2023. Will the minister please explain the reason for the closed non-competitive process of this grant, considering there are many multicultural communities across Australia, other than those who were invited to apply, who are also deserving candidates for this grant? Will the minister please explain what consultation process was undertaken by the Department of Home Affairs to determine the eligibility criteria for applicants for the grant? How is it fair to the wider multicultural community to fund only those organisations who were invited to apply for the grant?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For some background on this, on 7 February 2023 the Department of Home Affairs opened Local Multicultural Projects grant opportunities via the community grants hub, and closed it on 20 February. There were only 13 days to apply. The total funding was just over $5 million over three years. The purposes and objectives of the program were to support organisations with grants, to develop new multicultural infrastructure, including places of worship, to upgrade existing multicultural committee facilities, and to celebrate key multicultural events and festivals, which we all agree are very worthy. But the eligibility of applicants was determined by their ability to identify and deliver to their local communities events, services and amenities which met program objectives. However, no further organisations will be invited to apply, so it was very much an open-and-shut case. The grant opportunities closed the non-competitive grant selection process. The department considers that is an appropriate type of selection process. Does the minister agree that is a fair way to conduct a grants process considering the previous Labor opposition was so scathing of programs under the Liberal government supporting, in particular, migrant communities and places of worship when they had been attacked? I respectfully request that the minister respond to these questions at the appropriate time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  Cybersecurity incidents are on the rise and are a threat to Australia's national interest and safety. Cybercrime is thought to be the biggest threat facing any business with an online presence. It has cost Australia around $42 billion in the last financial year, according to the Australian Cyber Security Centre and the University of New South Wales. Many people feel you can't put a price tag on our private data—that is certainly true—our electricity grid or our online economy. They are so valuable. The wider community feels this investment and Home Affairs' work in this space is worth continuing. It's important to strengthen our protections across all of this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the 2021-22 financial year, more than 76,000 cybercrime reports were made via ReportCyber, with one cybercrime report made approximately every seven minutes. There are many factors that feed into the global cyber threat we are experiencing. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased this threat globally. We have seen many malicious actors—both state and nonstate actors—seeking to garner and capture the sensitive and private information of citizens. They do this by targeting Australians and their small businesses. Most incidents identified by the Australian Cyber Security Centre noted the use of very simple techniques, and a lot of this can be protected with very simple defences. People in my electorate of Wills have contacted me about the issues that they face. One woman was quite distressed about being called by scammers as well as contacted online, and she immediately reported this and came to me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She immediately reported this and came to me. There are others who have been very worried about the security of their small businesses and their websites. They're worried about being prey to these malicious attacks. Of course, many contacted my office after being victims of the cyber incident involving Optus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People are rightly worried about their data and their private information being in the wrong hands. As a government, we are very aware of this real threat to cybersecurity. We are aware that cybersecurity issues are prevalent and exceeding anything that we've seen before. Unfortunately, the previous government failed to deliver any leadership on cybersecurity. They abolished the role of cybersecurity in the ministry. They failed to mandate cyber incident reporting obligations to government. They failed to deliver on the need for stronger penalties to protect online privacy. They failed to report publicly on the effectiveness of the 2020 cybersecurity strategy. How can we improve systems if we don't even know whether our systems are working? As a nation, we were left woefully underprepared by those opposite when they were in government. Because of their failures, we were not able to be resilient when it came to the impacts of cyberattacks. We had poor data and security in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side, the Albanese government is a responsible government. We are a government that supports the Australian people. If you fall the into a cyberattack or a data breach, we will support you no matter where you are in Australia. We've committed to making Australia the most cybersecure nation in the world by 2030. The other mob are all talk, no action. This government has already started doing the work, albeit quietly and effectively—but that's important. We've already set up the 'hack the hackers' task force. This is a 100-strong task force of ASD and AFP officers who are hacking back at criminals seeking harm Australia and Australians. We are delivering $19.5 million to protect our most critical infrastructure assets through the Cyber and Infrastructure Security Centre. We're working closely with industry to develop Australia's new national cybersecurity strategy and we're building a national office for cybersecurity within the Department of Home Affairs. We're working across multiple portfolios in delivering this new national cybersecurity exercise program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a community level we are supporting individuals, businesses and organisations in being able to report a cybercrime incident or vulnerability through the Australian Cyber Security Centre. There is more work to be done, but that is already underway. We want to build a capacity to ensure people are more prepared and work together towards this government's commitment to making Australia the most cybersecure nation in the world by 2030. I want to assure the Australian people to feel more at ease that this government, these ministers—the home affairs minister, the minister for immigration—are working day in, day out to secure Australians' personal information and keep them secure from cybersecurity incidents, which are a serious threat to our safety and our national interest. This government is taking action and doing the job.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  In a free and modern society such as Australia, the word 'slavery' is not one that generally comes up at the dinner table. As Australians, we believe that in this country workers are protected, that they have the opportunity to earn a basic wage and that no-one can be forced into a job that they don't want to do and doesn't meet our country's strict standards. For the most part, that's true. We have systems in place set by all levels of government and avenues that our citizens and visa holders can take to call out employers who do not meet those standards. Unfortunately, there is an uncomfortable reality that, in the peripheries of our day-to-day lives right here in Australia, modern slavery and exploitation are more prevalent than we would like to imagine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These issues are particularly concerning amongst immigrant populations and affect more women than they do men. Where there are vulnerable people, there will be predators and predatory practices from those set to benefit from their exploitation, and it is our bipartisan role to provide adequate protections against slavery and, conversely, adequate penalties for those who abuse their positions of power. I would like to acknowledge the work of my colleagues, the former minister and assistant minister for home affairs, who successfully implemented the Modern Slavery Act 2018, further progressing the policy with the National Action Plan to Combat Modern Slavery 2020-25 and then adding to this with the creation of the Support for Trafficked People Program. These were not small advancements in this space, and each who contributed to these policies and programs from all sides of the floor should be thanked and congratulated for their bipartisan efforts. But I do need to give particular kudos to the current Leader of the Opposition, the member for McPherson and the member for Mitchell for spearheading these initiatives during their time in their ministerial roles with the Department of Home Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new government, in its second budget, has committed additional funding to this space—sadly, this has been driven by an increase in demand, and I don't sheet that home to the current government—continuing the work started by my coalition colleagues, and I thank them for their renewed commitment to these critical programs. I'd like to acknowledge the $23.4 million that will be provided over four years. It has been earmarked to increase the support provided in the original Support for Trafficked People Program from 45 days to 90 days. This was available as an extension in certain circumstances, but has been made standard through these measures. As well, there will be an 18-month pilot program to allow direct referrals from community providers without the need to engage with the AFP. It is completely understandable, when you see police agencies from overseas who are particularly corrupt, that some victims, particularly immigrants, are afraid to make a report to the AFP in case it affects their visa status or perhaps have a distrust of police in general. Having been police officer and a prosecutor, I've seen that firsthand, so it's good to have a trusted, internationally recognised brand like the Australian Red Cross involved. It's very pleasing to see that, and I'm keen to see the outcome of this pilot.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, when dealing with third-party organisations, and even with our own internal entities, there needs to be appropriate checks and balances in place, so my question to the minister is: what are the checks and balances that will be implemented to protect the integrity of the proposed 18-month STPP referrals pilot program, and can the minister ensure that a review of the program and the results and findings will be reported to parliament? My second question is: can the minister outline the role of the New South Wales Anti-slavery Commissioner, particularly with reference to the sexual servitude space in the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children? Finally I would like to ask the minister to provide a concrete commitment to the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation to ensure that the important work that they are doing is adequately funded and resourced.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  I'm proud to represent one of the most diverse communities in Australia. I acknowledge the member for Fowler, who probably represents a community that's a little bit more diverse than mine. But, I can tell you what, I'm very proud to represent a very diverse community in Bennelong. Sixty-six per cent of those who live in Bennelong have one or both parents born overseas. Over 50 per cent of my community speak a language other than English at home. That diversity makes our community stronger, and migration and immigration into this country makes our community stronger. Each and every month, I have the pleasure of going to a citizenship ceremony at one of the three local councils in my area. It's something I've been doing for nearly a decade now in my role as a councillor and mayor, and it's one of my favourite things to do is an elected official. I share that special day with locals who have been in the community for a little while, having come from overseas and having made that really hard decision to leave their homeland and move to Australia, just like my parents did back in the sixties and eighties. They make that really hard decision to uproot their families and move to Australia because it's a land of promise and hope. To celebrate that day with them is something that I really relish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm so glad that this government has fixed up the mess that was left behind by the former government in immigration processing and visa times. Citizenship is exactly an area in which this government has made many, many inroads. In the last 12 months alone the backlog of citizenship applications has been reduced by 30 per cent, with the number of applications now sitting at below 93,000 the first time in six years. That is quite an achievement. In the past 12 months alone, over 173,000 people have received Australian citizenship through conferral. That's an 18 per cent increase on the year before. Average processing times have also undergone a substantial reduction of 40 per cent, with more than 90 per cent of applicants only waiting six months to attend a ceremony. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have witnessed this feedback firsthand. I remember not that long ago, particularly when we had to do citizenship ceremonies during the pandemic, we had to do some of these processes online. I remember asking people: 'How long has the process been? Has it been difficult?' They would say: 'We've been waiting two, three years for our citizenship. It's been a difficult process.' I had feedback at the citizenship ceremony in Ryde only a few weeks ago that someone had their application processed and became an Australian citizen within six months. That is something that is a direct consequence of a Labor government, because we value immigration, we value citizenship and we value a pathway to permanent residency and citizenship, which those opposite just did not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to government, over one million visas were left unprocessed. We had a previous government that told people to go home, to leave this country, rather than helping them to stay here. They said, 'Leave,' and they had no plan for reopening the borders. We had to employ 684 new staff to support the visa system to get through this backlog, because we on this side of the House understand the importance of migration to our social fabric and the importance of migration to our economy. The Liberal legacy was dire. They undermined Australia's visa system. They prioritised temporary immigration over permanent residency and citizenship, and they told people to go home during the pandemic and had no plan for when the border opened. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last few months, we've seen these attacks on immigrants and on migrants go even further. We've had questions in question time and MPIs blaming new citizens and migrants and those who choose to make Australia home for the failures of the past 10 years of their government. They're blaming migration for traffic jams in Sydney. They're blaming migration for the housing crisis that they left us with. Shame on them for doing that. We on this side of the House will never do that, because we know that a secure, transparent and efficient migration system makes this country strong. It is what our country was built on. It's what our economy was built on. I am very proud to be here as a son of parents who made that decision to move from overseas and come to Australia. They were welcomed with open arms, and never should that change. Never should migrants be blamed for 10 years of inaction on infrastructure delivery from the former government. We are tackling some of these issues that they raise, but we will not be blaming migration for them. I ask the minister to update the House on what improvements have been made to the visa processing system since forming government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  I thank the member for Bennelong. I agree that our electorates are some of the most diverse in the country. I think mine is the most diverse; I have to claim that. Last week, we welcomed 500 new Australian citizens in a Fairfield City Council citizenship ceremony, so I share your view on the importance of this Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2023-2024. The government recently presented to us, the crossbench, and showed us the summary of what the migration review has revealed about our visa system. It is convoluted and complex and has a network of categories and visas that really looks like a web. I think it leaves the spiderweb for dead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I applaud the Minister for Home Affairs for taking on the challenge to review our migration process, I also encourage her to include in this review a look at what happens after migrants or refugees have settled. As I have previously said, my community has firsthand experience of the impact of migration and refugee settlement. We are a multicultural melting pot, with our country built on the shoulders of migrants and refugees, dating back as far as post World War II, with the influx of German and Italian migrants. Recently, we settled 12,000 Syrian refugees in Fairfield City Council alone—more than the rest of the state of New South Wales. However, we have not received the funding for basic infrastructure and services to match the settlement responsibilities our city took on. Our roads, public transport and hospitals aren't funded to support the increased population pressure and needs. Our schools are bursting at the seams with limited resources—human and capital. Now the cost-of-living and housing crises are acutely felt by everyone. I asked the minister: Will the review also take into consideration housing and infrastructure needs to support newly arrived migrants as well as current residents?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that, as part of the budget, the government will introduce an improved delivery model for the Adult Migrant English Program from 1 January 2025 to allow migrants and citizens to improve their ability to speak the English language, which I have benefitted from as a former refugee myself, so I know the importance of learning the English language. As well, it will help gain employment and other settlement outcomes. I welcome the improved delivery model; however, there is no additional funding allocated in this budget, so how will the model be improved with no additional funding? How will it get rolled out across the 300 locations in Australia? And which electorates will be prioritised? When settling into a new country, migrants need as much support as possible for them to feel secure and part of the community. It is imperative the government address these needs within the review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget revealed that $75.8 million is to be allocated for improving visa processing over the course of two years. In the past decade, Australia has undeniably experienced an influx of visa applications with skilled and humanitarian migrants. I am sure I speak for many electorate officers when I say our staff and our officers feel the impact of the inefficiency and clogs within the current visa processing system. We are inundated with inquiries from our constituents about the delay in processing time, as the Department of Home Affairs is unable to keep up with the number of applications coming through. There is a human cost, as the delay to the application process causes anxiety for people having to wait for an outcome. I had a constituent who applied for a temporary protection visa and who has been caught up in the process and delayed for approximately four years. Migration is by far one of the most significant issues in my electorate of Fowler. Just in the last year, nearly 30 per cent of our cases are to do with immigration, visas or passports, the biggest portion of constituent work by a long shot.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the weekend I had the pleasure to join the Sabian Mandaean community for their remembrance day. Many were lucky to be settled in Australia after surviving trauma and atrocities of war in their homeland, but they have spent years waiting for answers as to why some of the family, friends and community members are still living in limbo in Turkiye. I ask the minister: What are the measures being implemented by the Department of Home Affairs to improve the efficiency of visa processing times? Can the minister clarify which visa application streams will benefit from this additional funding? For example, will humanitarian visa applications be prioritised over skilled migrant visas? As is clear when it comes to migration, many factors come into play. We need to ensure those who come to this lucky country have every chance to succeed in their new lives, whether they come as international students, skilled professionals or part of a humanitarian intake.</span>

I will start with the member for Fowler. I did touch on the improved processing times that we have achieved. Due to the hard work of staff and additional investments, they are significantly lower, and we have reduced the backlog enormously, if you look to particular visa categories.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps I will make the offer here in the Federation Chamber: obviously the member for Fowler knows how to find me. I would be very pleased to go through those issues and our vision for the AMEP with her. She would be aware in the previous budget there was an additional investment made to identify some of the efficiencies and some of the ways in which you can reach more people to ensure everyone gets the English language skills they need to be an effective citizen and to fulfil their potential in our country. I welcome her contribution, as always, and look forward to further discussions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Cowper made a great contribution which went beyond my portfolio responsibilities but I will convey his remarks to the Attorney-General and reiterate that everyone in this parliament stands against modern slavery and stands resolved to ensure that our legislative framework and our enforcement regime are fit for purpose. The same goes for migrant worker exploitation, which is within my direct responsibility. I was pleased to hear his reflections based on his experience in a former life. I said to him that we have heard from people like him who have said we do need a firewall so that people who have been exploited in the workplace can come forward without fear of their visa being cancelled. We have acted on advice that he has given me in this chamber now and advice others have been given, and I'd be very pleased to go through the details of that with him.</span>

Can I ask both shadow ministers to reflect from time to time on some of the language which they use because on some of these issues we really need to think about how what we say impacts people's lives and their decisions. In respect of Afghanistan, I think this is particularly challenging. I acknowledge the member for Mitchell and the work he did at the time of the evacuation, which was an extraordinary time. I am proud as an Australian of the efforts of the Australian government and all of our forces, in Home Affairs, in the military and in other departments, to get people to safety. I acknowledge that here we disagree on many things, but I admire the work that he did. The challenge since then has been great for both governments, and we acknowledge that we have an enormous demand from people who are particularly vulnerable because of the work they have done for and with Australians. </span>

We are determined to do what you did in government—you, the current opposition—and give effect to the priorities that were determined by the former government in consultation with the Australian Afghan community. Shadow minister Wood, I think you should reflect on the language that you used about the priorities. I think you should reflect on your language, and the reference you made to the current Australian government is unworthy of any member of this parliament. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Wannon also raised a large number of issues, and I will respond to a couple of them very quickly. Again, I ask him to reflect on the language he uses, the inflammatory and frankly wrong language that he uses, the divisive language that he uses about immigration and its impacts, particularly given the comments he made like, 'Well, we need to get our international students back, we need to get working holiday visa holders back and get all those people back as soon as we can.' He said that, but he seems to have forgotten about it, when these of course are the people who are returning after the pause in the pandemic and who are impacting temporarily the NOM. He should reflect on that. He raised an important individual case, and I will say this: as he well knows, I can't comment on the individual case in this place, and he should reflect on that. Secondly, he should know that I take very seriously every representation made by members of parliament, and I consider them on their merits in accordance with the law. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  Good evening, everybody. I am pleased to speak in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2023-2024. I will cover a few topics with regard to my dual portfolio responsibility of government services and the NDIS. I will speak of the tangible benefits both agencies offer Australians and how the Albanese government's budget not only secures and improves their opportunities in the future but provides a vision for how we can better support Australians. I might start with the Services Australia emergency response. I'm pleased to announce that the budget allocation will boost the agency's vital work in emergency response and in sustaining myGov. Services Australia has a workforce about 30,000 strong, about 20 per cent of the Public Service. It administers $226 billion in payments each year. It has 318 service centres, 364 agent services and 212 access points. Australians are more likely than not to interact with Services Australia in their lifetime, across areas as broad as health, child care, education and retirement, and Services Australia supports Australians in their hour of greatest need, when they are impacted by natural disasters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw the work of Services Australia staff up close in the first months in my portfolio, including in my own community, along the Maribyrnong River, which was inundated by floodwaters last October. I'm proud to say that, as the minister responsible for Services Australia, I saw responsive, professional, compassionate staff, easily identifiable in their blue polo shirts. They lived up to their 'interaction over transaction', 'person first, process second' approach. I think Australians doing it tough across the country gain a sense of comfort when they are able to access their services from Services Australia in a timely manner. They are connected to government services. They can get emergency payments in their bank accounts even before they leave the makeshift service centres. It's also great that we have four mobile service centres. Over 17 years they've visited 185,000 people in 6,100 communities, with more than a million kilometres of travel. In fact, just this morning, along with Minister Murray Watt, I launched our latest service centre on wheels, Kangaroo Paw II. It's now winding its way to its home base on the west coast, where it will be prepositioned to help the regional and remote communities of Western Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the experience of the last three years of natural disasters has demonstrated that it's smarter and more economical to create these mobile workforces rather than assemble an expensive ad hoc workforce immediately after the disaster. So we've allocated $231.8 million in the budget to deliver better outcomes, to have 850 extra staff available to do disaster relief work, because natural disasters seem to be the rule, not the exception, these days. We've also been investing significantly in myGov. We've invested $134 million to continue myGov's operation. I'm pleased to say that today we announced that two million Australians have uploaded the myGov app.</span>

                    </a>  We're delivering on our commitment to get the scheme back on track and, importantly, to rebuild trust with participants, families, carers and service providers. We have a range of targeted measures to uplift the capability and systems of the NDIS, to improve innovation, to make access to high-quality supports easier and to provide an overdue boost for our fraud and safety watchdogs. The budget commits a total of $910 million over the next four years to improve the effectiveness and the delivery of the scheme and the safety of NDIS participants.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017 the scheme had about 170,000 participants and 4,000 people working in the agency. Now there are 590,000 people in the scheme, approximately, and still only about 4,000 people working in the agency. It's obvious to all that the agency is understaffed and staff haven't been adequately supported with training and better systems. So we're putting greater support into the staff, because, if the initial planning decision is right, then peak participant experience in the scheme is a much more consistent and predictable matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also providing $56.4 million to strengthen decision-making and guidance around supported independent living. We're introducing a home and living panel of highly trained staff to improve fairness and consistency. We have also allocated $7.3 million to take us closer to the goal of ensuring no people under 65 are living in residential aged care by 2025. We're also helping to work through reforming the planning. We want to move away, as a default position, from annual plans to longer plans. We want to develop a lifetime approach to planning. Longer plans will take the anxiety and uncertainty out of the issue. Then we move to quality supports and outcomes, but I will hand over to the member for Deakin.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="242515" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I'll start with the NDIS, given that the minister is here and included that in his remarks. The minister talked in his remarks about rebuilding trust in the scheme. One thing that I think we can all say and that we can all give credit to the minister for is that he was ruthlessly efficient in opposition, in a very unprincipled way, in making promises to the sector before the election and, sadly, falling very, very far short after the election. There's no doubt that he raised expectations before the election: that no plan would go backwards, that there were no sustainability issues with the scheme and that brilliant times would be ahead if he were to be minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now he claims that the NDIS is 'growing in its cost base too quickly'. He never mentioned that before the election. Indeed, before the election, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">You can't move around the corridors of Parliament in Canberra without tripping over a Coalition Minister whispering the Scheme is unsustainable … I'm here to tell you today that is a lie. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's come as a big shock to the sector now to hear from the minister that talking about the sustainability of the NDIS was a big lie before the election but is now the mantra of the government. One questions whether that was imposed on him by the Treasurer or the Prime Minister. One could readily imagine the Prime Minister taking great delight in imposing that on the minister, given he made such promises before the election. I want the minister today to come clean. Does he still believe that the scheme is fully sustainable, or does he agree with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, who have said that the scheme has sustainability issues?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, I want the minister to answer how on earth the government came to its arbitrary increase of eight per cent per annum in costs in the scheme, as opposed to the expected increase of 14 per cent. What on earth do those tens of billions of dollars that have now been banked as savings into the forward estimates represent? Who of the 600,000 or so participants in the scheme need to be nervous about where those reductions are coming from? There's been no explanation to date about where those savings will eventuate and who, in the end, will suffer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen comments from the minister and indeed many in the government in recent times questioning those families with children with an autism diagnosis. There's huge anxiety now, amongst tens of thousands of those families, that they are likely to be the place where the government seeks to get their six per cent saving per annum from. Without any explanation from the government, that is anxiety that is certainly being felt. I think it would be worthy for the minister to get up today and make it very clear to all of those families—tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands—that they will not see their plans go backwards, that they will not see their children denied access to the scheme and indeed that future potential participants in the scheme with an autism diagnosis won't be denied access to the scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, we've got a minister who said there were no sustainability issues before the election, but sustainability issues have been the catchcry of the government in relation to the NDIS for months and months now. We then see tens of billions of dollars of banked savings in the budget over the forward estimates, without any explanation as to where those savings will be made. So I invite the minister to make very clear that the existing participants in the scheme won't be paying for those savings that they were promised would never eventuate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also invite the minister to clarify why on earth the NDIA were not consulted in relation to the eight per cent growth target. How on earth would you not consult with the agency responsible for the scheme when making such a huge change? The new CEO admitted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, we were not consulted on the eight per cent growth target in advance of what was being proposed for discussion at National Cabinet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can the minister confirm that he's had those discussions now and that the NDIA is aware of how those savings will be achieved? </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  Many Australians have described the National Disability Insurance Scheme, when it works, as life changing. When it was first introduced under a Labor government, there was much hope. Ten years later, it's a Labor government, led by the Minister for the NDIS and Minister for Government Services, who is once again listening and acting on the concerns of people with a disability, their families and carers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this year's budget, we see federal government's most significant investment ever in the National Disability Insurance Agency, of $721 million, to lift the capability of the agency. Part of this is an investment of more than $73 million to better support participants to manage their plan. A key reform is longer-term planning because we know that short-term plans often create severe ongoing anxiety and frustration. Importantly, the minister is now listening to the disability community, who, under the government's reforms, will not have to re-prove their disability every 12 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, I've heard such stories often. These heart-wrenching stories are not easy to hear, so I'm pleased we finally have a government that is listening. It's listening to participants, carers and families, and responding to the recommendations from the joint standing committee's 2023 interim report. This budget's $429 million investment to improve the NDIS workforce capability, resulting in better consistency and equity in decision-making, responds to the recommendations in the interim report because the bottom line is: we are here to serve the disability community to make lives better. This budget investment demonstrates this, with a strong focus on rebuilding trust and the capability of staff, to help participants, once again, with compassion and expertise.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  I will move on to the cashless debit card, in the Social Services portfolio, which, in the litany of failures that we've seen in 12 months from this government, is probably the most spectacular and devastating decision that this government has taken. And, sadly, it's devastating for those people who can afford it the least. The cashless debit card was a program that was requested by a number of communities around our country, who were seeking to address rising problems that they were seeing as a result of alcohol, drugs and other forms of antisocial behaviour. Funds from welfare were being used, sadly, to exacerbate problems that they were seeing in those communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card program was very successful in a number of those communities. We warned the government, when it first brought forward its legislation to abolish the cashless debit card, that that decision would have devastating consequences. I remember having very willing discussions over the dispatch box with the minister at the time, asking: how on earth could pouring more alcohol and drugs into vulnerable communities be seen to help those communities? We warned them. We warned the government, and now what do we see? We have seen reports out of a number of former cashless debit card sites of antisocial behaviour, violence, alcohol and drugs getting worse and worse, and almost to the day being able to pinpoint the spike, particularly in crime statistics, to the date on the cashless debit card was abolished by those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite, on one hand, denounced the Northern Territory Labor government for what they presided over, yet are now seeking to take that policy nationally to the cashless debit card sites. And every time members of the government interject, they're not just interjecting at me. They're interjecting at those members of the community who have been coming forward and saying, 'We are seeing crime rising in our communities.' Leaders of those communities and members of those communities are seeing it. I ask: what on earth did Australians get for their $217.7 million, one of the single largest additional investments in the October budget, to abolish the CDC, other than more crime, more family violence and more domestic violence, which is coming through in the statistics. We see, in crime statistics out of Ceduna, South Australia, a very clear spike. It has been reported on. Yet Australians have paid $217.7 million, for that terrible outcome.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the ministers: when have they visited those sites, who did they meet with, and have they apologised and explained to those communities that they now understand that abolishing the cashless debit card, or removing its compulsory nature, has led to crime and antisocial behaviour being felt by those communities? If they haven't visited them and apologised in recent weeks, will the ministers commit to getting out to each and every one of those communities and, firstly, apologising for the catastrophic decision to abolish the CDC, and then committing to re-imposing the compulsory nature of the CDC in those communities? This should not be an issue that is prosecuted in the parliament—all decent people should know. You don't need to be an expert, you don't need to have a PhD, you don't need to have a doctorate—pouring alcohol and drugs onto the streets of these communities does not help! More alcohol and more drugs do not help in these communities. It's an absolute outrage that anybody in the government would think that is a decent thing to do. I invite the minister to commit to getting out to those communities and apologising to the people who are suffering now, and to then commit to putting the CDC back into those communities who want them.</span>

Here in the ACT, in my electorate of Canberra, people are experiencing the pressures of housing affordability to a huge extent, as much if not more than anyone around this country. In the 2021 census we learned that 38 per cent of households in the electorate of Canberra were renters compared to the national average of 30.6 per cent. We also know that around nine per cent of Canberra households—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms PAYNE:</span>
                    </a>  We know that around nine per cent of Canberra households have rent or mortgage repayments greater than 30 per cent of their household incomes, meaning nine per cent of Canberrans are currently living in either rental or mortgage stress. While Canberra is a relatively well-off community, with average incomes higher than the national average and relatively low unemployment, it means that it is a very difficult place to live on a low income, and that our rents and housing costs are very high in this city. Approximately 1,160 Canberrans on census night were experiencing homelessness, making up around 0.8 per cent of our city's population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So these issues are really acute. I found this recently as I have run a deliberative process, the Canberra Forum, over the last six months, which involves 40 randomly selected Canberrans who come together to choose a topic and make recommendations to me. The topic that they chose after much thoughtful consideration was housing. They have spent time hearing from experts and working on that. I was incredibly pleased and thankful to have the Minister for Housing and Homelessness come and address that group. I know the group found that discussion with her to be very important. Something that was really important to this group of Canberrans is that housing be seen as a human right, so I'm very pleased this is exactly how our government and our minister and our Prime Minister see housing. This is an incredibly important issue right now for Australians. It's central to the dignity and wellbeing of each and every Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, in the Senate, we are trying to get through our $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund to deliver 30,000 new social and affordable homes in its first five years, and investments of $500 million per year into social and affordable homes. This is also prioritising housing for women and children escaping domestic violence and for veterans facing homelessness. My question is: how could anybody in this place who is listening to their constituents vote against new homes being built, particularly for those priority groups? If they are truly listening to anyone in their electorates who is experiencing these issues, I don't understand how they can vote this way. I'm talking about those in the Liberal-National coalition and in the Greens who are failing to support this incredibly important future fund that we are establishing to build homes because we believe housing is a human right and centrally important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just one of the things we are doing to invest in housing at the moment. To talk again about the ACT, part of which I represent in this place, in the 2022-23 budget our government provided assistance to three Reconnect services in the ACT, namely Gugan Gulwan Youth Aboriginal Corporation, CatholicCare Canberra &amp; Goulburn, and Queanbeyan Multilingual Centre. The Reconnect program is a community based early intervention program for young people aged between 12 and 21, and these three particular organisations have assisted 140 young people experiencing or at risk of homelessness to get secure housing. We are a government that understands that safe and affordable housing is central to the security and dignity of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The housing accord we announced in last year's budget includes federal funding to deliver 10,000 affordable homes over five years. The Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee is already helping thousands of Australians into home ownership after the Albanese government brought forward its launch by three months. Again, my question is: how could anyone not get behind these measures to build more homes for Australians?</span>

I would say—I was listening intently—perhaps the member should get on the phone to the ACT Labor government, who might have some control over the issues she described in the ACT. She should ask them to stop constraining housing supply, as they've been doing for many years. Fess up to your constituents—that's the first thing I'd say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to housing, I think there are probably few areas in the government which have seen an agenda as much in tatters as the very thin housing agenda. I think it's great the minister is here and she should answer these questions. I would ask the minister: does she recommit to the one million homes aspiration? It was a promise in the October budget. It's now been downgraded, sadly, to an aspiration, which I think will give anyone watching this a clue as to the likelihood of the minister recommitting to it. With some fanfare, we heard in the October budget that the government was committing to the private sector effectively delivering one million homes over five years. They forgot to mention that, actually, one million homes over five years have been delivered for a very long time and that's business as usual. But we now see that promise in absolute tatters. There's no way any serious economist thinks the government will reach that aspiration now.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also ask the minister to outline in some detail when on earth the Help to Buy Scheme will start. The Help to Buy Scheme was supposed to start on 1 January. We came to the parliament last year expecting that it would be in front of us because it was supposed to commence on 1 January. Now it's a fair bit after 1 January and we don't even have draft legislation or a bill in front of us. We've had no announcement from the government. As a former housing minister I know it does take a lot of work to deliver those programs, but you do have to deliver them in the time promised. It was supposed to start on 1 January. The Prime Minister spoke about cheaper mortgages. I'm not sure there are many Australians who have one of those very precious cheaper mortgages, so I want the minister to answer: when will we see the Help to Buy Scheme start? Admittedly, it was a commitment made by her predecessor in a shadow portfolio role, but when will it start? Get moving, guys. Get moving and get some work done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has been out there—in a very flattering way, I think—spruiking the Home Guarantee Scheme, which was my creation that I delivered as housing minister, and I agree with the housing minister. The Home Guarantee Scheme is a remarkable scheme not only for first-home buyers but for single parents. That was a great expansion to the scheme, which I was very proud to put in place. And of course we see through not only the regional scheme but also the general scheme that in regional areas the Home Guarantee Scheme is helping. But I ask the minister: what on earth is the government doing other than delivering Coalition landmark policies like the Home Guarantee Scheme? What assistance are they providing to first-home buyers?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that in the last TLA bill we saw the government committed to adopting the former coalition government's First Home Super Saver Scheme, another policy I was very proud to deliver as minister. It seems that they are now committing to it after promising that they would abolish it. Can the minister confirm that they do now see the virtue in another landmark scheme, the First Home Super Saver Scheme?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, can the minister today table the investment mandate for their so-called Housing Australia Future Fund? Can the minister outline how the Housing Australia Future Fund will be administered? Will it be required to repay the $400 million or so in interest that it will cost in borrowings to the Commonwealth? What is the cost to the Commonwealth of the Future Fund administering the scheme? Will the Housing Australia Future Fund, which is not due to commence until the middle of 2024, deliver enough homes for the 1.5 million migrants that the government will be bringing in over the same period? If so, how on earth will 1.5 million migrants live in so-called 30,000 homes, which we are very dubious will ever be delivered?</span>

We are doing more than any federal government has done in the past in terms of housing and housing affordability. Indeed, there was very little action from those opposite, but I'm glad to see that the shadow minister is talking about Help to Buy, which is our shared equity scheme. Given the shadow minister is so interested in it, I hope that means he will support it when it comes into this place, because this is a good scheme. We are talking about a shared equity scheme with 30 per cent or 40 per cent—depending on whether it's an existing or new home—government equity in a person's home. It is to make it easier for people to get into their homes. We remain committed to our Help to Buy shared equity scheme and we look forward to implementing it, hopefully with the opposition's support given they're so interested in it.</span>

We are making changes to that to modernise the scheme and to improve the scheme. We added to the scheme with the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee, which is going really well right across regional Australia. You saw in this budget more in terms of our housing agenda. You saw changes to build-to-rent to incentivise more build-to-rent in Australia. We need to get this up and running. The Property Council is talking about an additional 150,000 to 250,000 dwellings because of the changes that we made in the last budget, and we have already seen more build to rent being proposed around the country since that announcement on budget.</span>

Thirty per cent of Australians are now renters, which is why we're doing this.</span>

                    </a>  I say to the shadow minister: will this make you change your mind? We are committed to the Housing Australia Future Fund. We're talking about 30,000 additional social and affordable homes in the first five years of the fund. That is a very significant investment and a very significant turnaround in terms of investment in social and affordable homes from a federal government. What we want to do is work with the states and territories, with local government and indeed with community housing providers to build capacity and leverage other investments such as institutional investment from superannuation funds and overseas pension funds. We know that there is a lot of interest in investing in this area. We want to be able to do this so that more Australians have a safe, affordable place to call home. We are working right across the board, whether it be for direct homeownership or for more social and affordable housing, right across the housing agenda. We have put renters' rights on the National Cabinet agenda, where we are talking about making sure that all renters across Australia know what their rights are. We want to lift it to make sure that no renter loses any existing rights but has some consistency so that people that are renting in Australia understand clearly what their rights are and they can have a bit more power in their hands. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We of course had the National Housing Accord in our October budget last year, our first budget. We have always talked about an aspirational target of a million homes. We are working with the sector and the construction sector, which together with states and territories and institutional investors have signed up to the National Housing Accord. We are working with states and territories about what reforms are going to be required to meet this number because we are serious about working with them on reform to get more homes on the ground more quickly and, importantly, to make sure that they are the right homes. We need to make sure that people can afford to live close to where they work or where they go to school. That is the whole point of the National Housing Accord. It is about making sure that we work with other tiers of government and with the sector so that we get the right homes in the right places. We want to plan this better. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, of course, have also had a boost to homelessness, unfortunately. There are far too many Australians living with homelessness at the moment, so we boosted funding by $67.5 million in addition to what was already in the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement, with a one-year extension now totalling $1.7 billion going to the states and territories to support people who need that support the most. We will continue to do that every single day.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  The opposition has needed to consistently remind this government that we are in a cost-of-living crisis, and that is why it is so important that government services are delivered efficiently and also important that government ministers with responsibility for the delivery of services make themselves available to participate in parliamentary mechanisms of accountability and transparency. But when it comes to the member for Maribyrnong, his contempt for parliamentary accountability and scrutiny knows no bounds. He has repeatedly failed to meet the deadlines for questions asked of him in estimates in relation to his dismal performance in government services. He has consistently failed to answer questions in writing within the mandated time, and now tonight he has shown his contempt for this additional mechanism of parliamentary accountability and scrutiny because he can't even be bothered to turn up to answer questions in the consideration in detail process. It is absolutely disgraceful that the minister couldn't be bothered to be here, and what is equally disgraceful is the dismal performance of Services Australia under his watch, with Australians waiting longer and longer on the phone to actually speak with somebody at Centrelink or at Services Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">New data obtained by the opposition has confirmed that in this financial year to 31 March 2023 over three million Australians chose to terminate their call with Centrelink, instead of waiting to actually speak to a customer service officer. What is worse is that call waiting times have risen dramatically under this Labor government. It's taking on average over 31 minutes for Australians to be connected with Centrelink when they are calling about the Child Care Subsidy. If they are calling the employment services line there is an average wait time of 29 minutes, valuable time that could otherwise be spent looking for a job. But Labor is making it harder for jobseekers to do what they want to do and what they should be doing. You would think that a Labor government would prioritise unclogging these lines during a cost-of-living crisis when Australians are in need of receiving government payments and services. Before the election, the Minister for Government Services promised to improve the frontline delivery of services. He made that promise, and people who are naive, people who haven't had the unfortunate experience of dealing with the member for Maribyrnong over many years, might have been fooled into taking that promise at face value. That would've been a grave mistake. It would've shown a real lack of experience in the conduct and the behaviour of the member for Maribyrnong over his entire undistinguished period of public life.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He promised to improve the frontline delivery of services, but that commitment clearly has not extended to telephony, so I ask: what are the minister's plans to stop the stratospheric and continuing increase in Centrelink call waiting times under this government? What is the minister going to do about that? What's he going to do about the fall in staffing levels at Centrelink—dramatically falling from 28,560 this financial year to 26,692 in the next financial year?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is this Minister for Government Services going to do about improving digital service delivery? Under the previous government, this was a major focus. The highly successful myGov app is a very good example of that, planned, developed and funded by the coalition. But what we have discovered through Senate estimates is that Labor have cut almost $250 million from Services Australia for service transformation. The funding announced in the budget, as the minister himself has described it, is simply to 'sustain' this vital platform. This is in stark contrast to the former coalition government's investment in myGov. We locked in funding for sustainment and enhancement, and that's essential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We didn't just stop at myGov. Look at the $1.6 billion dollars we delivered for the Welfare Payment Infrastructure Transformation Program, an overhaul of Centrelink's IT systems. With no dedicating funding under this government to improve how the government delivers services digitally, Australians can expect a far more clunky, outdated and ultimately unsafe user experience. Ironically, the direction that the minister is pursuing is entirely the opposite of the direction he was encouraged to pursue through the myGov user audit. Why has the minister so fundamentally dropped the ball on improving services, particularly those digital services which we now know Australians overwhelmingly prefer to use? I put that question. If the minister were here, instead of being too gutless to turn up, he could answer the questions.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  I'm incredibly pleased to see the measures in this budget on women's safety. I think it's important that men also take an interest and speak up on women's safety, because, frankly, it is everyone's business. We've seen a major cultural change in our country over recent decades, from the 1970s and 1980s. Domestic, sexual and family violence is no longer considered a private matter. It's a community responsibility, and rightly so. It's not a 'women's' problem to be solved—it doesn't affect only women, but it does affect women overwhelmingly—it's the community's problem to be solved. But the community can only do that with sustained government support. I consider that in the October budget and now, in this budget, no-one could possibly doubt the government's commitment to ending violence against women and children and ensuring women's safety. There has been $2.29 billion—that's billion with a b—invested in just two budgets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who thinks that women's safety or the women's portfolio is marginal or peripheral in this government does not understand this government. They fail to understand the government's agenda and its purpose. Unlike the former government, gender equality is at the core of everything that this government does. Frankly, this should always be a bipartisan thing, and it's welcome that the Leader of the Opposition said in his budget reply speech—in amongst the dog whistling—that he supports our measures in this budget on women's safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But they just can't help themselves with their negativity, can they? I've got a little press release here. It was issued on 4 June—my birthday, actually; I called my birthday 'my next 40th'; it was a special birthday—by the Hon. Sussan Ley, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and senator someone, whom I've never heard of. They were having a crack at the government's commitment of $169 million for 500 new frontline service and community workers over four years. That's 500 workers over four years. Of course, they need to be delivered through the states and territories, and negotiations for that commenced in December. So we announced this—what—six, seven months ago but, apparently, the fact that 500 workers haven't been delivered over seven months while we were doing it through the states and territories showed we have failed, that our commitment was in tatters, that it was a black mark and it prompted the opposition to sound the alarm on the government's performance on women's safety. Questioning the first national action plan under the national plan won't be delivered until August is inexcusable. A little prone to hyperbole but perhaps the deputy leader of the opposition's numerologist told her to use those words—you never know. But to be clear, the 500 workers will be delivered via the states and territories in a proper process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can understand why the opposition are confused, because when it comes to the arrangements of the Morrison government, ignoring proper process was something they excelled in. It was one of their very few special talents. Samantha Maiden reported that Chanel Contos met with a political staffer from the Morrison government for coffee in March 2022, who told her she was getting $8 million—that's a pretty good deal for coffee, isn't it—despite never having putting a submission in for funding. No submission for funding, one coffee, $8 million—that is proper process for the Liberal and Nationals. But it is not surprising that when the Morrison government had a problem with women they scrambled for a solution, made deals over coffee so they could get an announcement. But they didn't actually deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 500 new staff, as this budget shows, is on top of extending the national partnership. Of course, the national partnership—the rhetorical commitment to women's safety of those opposite—was another one of those booby-trapped measures that we inherited, because there was no funding from 30 June. The national partnership was expiring, so all those frontline services that support victim-survivors were facing a funding cut. But that is consistent with their record on women's safety. It was those opposite who thought milkshake ads were a good use of taxpayers' money to teach younger Australians about consent. It was those opposite who said their budget was good for women because women can take advantage of driving on new infrastructure and roads—terrific! That is gender equality. I mean, that is a fall from the glory days when Tony Abbott appointed himself as minister for women because he forgot to appoint one. There was only one woman out of the 18 in the cabinet—poor lonely Julie Bishop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Scott Morrison famously told the parliament that the women protesting outside for their rights to be free of sexual harassment and violence were 'lucky not to be shot' in our democracy. I am proud to serve in a caucus and a government with 53 per cent women that reflects the diversity of the Australian population. We have had an entire bloke fest over there for this whole debate. Shame on them.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  Family and domestic violence in this country continue to be a scourge on our whole society. This government's national prevention plan is a commendable continuation and adaptation of the coalition's plan before it, which was built on successive plans of successive governments. But as each year passes, the statistics keep rolling in and they get worse and worse and worse. That is not me saying it; that is the data speaking. I believe that we have to face the reality that nothing intrinsically revolutionary has happened in the area of prevention. I'm not being critical of any government. I am saying, as a police officer of 30 years ago, working in my home town of Kempsey, nothing has changed, because there has been no revolutionary change in the way we address this. What has increased are the cases being prosecuted in courts. That might be because we have had a societal shift in reporting and an acceptance that this is not something that is behind closed doors. But in the keyword—prevention—there has been no paradigm shift.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow assistant minister for the prevention of family violence, last month I was in the Northern Territory and South Australia to continue consultations I've been undertaking in the domestic and family violence space. I met with representatives of law enforcement, Indigenous men's services, Relationships Australia, and drug and alcohol services in Darwin, Alice Springs and Adelaide. After a year of speaking with individuals, community groups and professional organisations, it is clear that a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate across the country. It is imperative that any proposed measures take into account the affected community's unique requirements, and, as a government, I believe we need to provide a toolbox approach to family violence. It's imperative that any proposed measures take into account the affected communities' unique requirements. I believe that as a government we need to provide that toolbox approach to family violence. What I mean by that is: the essential kit that can be broken down for those communities to use, and for those tools to be appropriately weighted towards prevention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that more funding needs to be directed towards prevention—and yes, we need that funding for response and recovery. It's also increasingly clear that the physical resourcing on the ground, at the coalface across the country, is critically inadequate. A focused approach needs to be taken quickly to better equip our existing providers and allow them to expand those services to address it successfully in the community. With this in mind, I was pleased to see the government had dedicated $169.4 million over four years for an additional 500 frontline community workers, with 200 earmarked for this year. I'd hoped to see transparent processes for identifying the areas most in need of additional supports—unfortunately, at this stage, none of those bodies promised for the coalface have actually been delivered, and I am uncertain how the allocation process will take place. My first question to the minister is: why have none of these promised workers been delivered and what is the process in determining where these workers are to be assigned?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, I note that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander national plan will now take 18 months to two years to put in place. Given the gravity the domestic violence problem in the First Nations community—which is a fact we all agree on—I cannot understand why it should take so long. Comparatively, I was recently a member of the Joint Select Committee on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice Referendum—a group that spent just five days on an inquiry around a referendum on Constitutional change, yet we need another two years for a separate plan for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people before we can put actions into place. My second question to the minister is: why is this process so conflated, given the immediate and urgent need?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services and Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I'm very pleased to be speaking tonight on our budget measures, their range and extent, and the assistance they provide. This is a budget that strengthens our safety net and improves the lives of so many vulnerable Australians, including people with a disability, First Nations peoples, and women and children escaping domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many Australians are doing it tough at the moment, and households are really feeling the pinch with cost-of-living pressures. That's why, in our budget   —our responsible budget—we are still delivering assistance to those people that require it the most. The budget delivers a $14.6 billion cost-of-living package, and in the social services portfolio alone we are providing $10 billion to strengthen our safety net—building on our investment in women's safety, addressing entrenched community disadvantage, supporting people with disability, and improving the wellbeing of Australians. Our budget delivers to Australians through a whole range of measures that we have spoken about—energy price relief, cheaper medicines, improvements to bulk-billing, more affordable child care, extended paid parental leave, and our measures on top of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on our increases to JobSeeker. We're providing $4.9 billion to increase the rates of JobSeeker for more than one million Australians. This will provide a further $40 a fortnight for those receiving youth allowance, parenting payments, Austudy, Abstudy, the youth disability support pension, and special benefits. Very importantly, we are expending eligibility for the existing higher rate of JobSeeker to support single recipients aged 55 and over who have been on income support for nine or more continuous months. We're doing this because we know that many older Australians face additional barriers when it comes to looking for work, particularly age discrimination. This reform will expand access to around 52,000 eligible Australians, who will receive an increase of $92.10 per fortnight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also important, we are providing the largest increase to Commonwealth rent assistance in more than 30 years. This is a vitally important move and will have a huge impact upon those who are receiving Commonwealth rent assistance. It's part of one of the many housing measures that we've brought out as we are looking to address the housing and homelessness crisis. And of course our Housing Australia Future Fund is a vitally important component of that. I call again upon those across the aisle in the opposition, and also those in the Greens, to really support our initiatives to make sure we can provide affordable housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Very importantly, on the single parenting payment, we are investing $1.9 billion to strengthen the safety net for single parents. We know that it's vitally important to do that. We know how difficult it can be for single parents to balance their caring responsibilities and full-time work, and we know that that doesn't end when a child turns eight. So we're expanding eligibility—increasing the age cut-off for the parent's youngest child from eight to 14.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I would like to speak on the very important issue of women's safety. I know this is an issue that everyone in this parliament is absolutely committed to. We are making women's safety a national priority. We know how important it is to deliver that change. Governments across Australia have come together with the goal to end violence against women and children in one generation. I know every member of this House shares in that goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To help us get there, this budget will provide an additional $589 million to further support women's safety, and that includes, of course, the implementation of our National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children—so vitally important. This investment will fund critical measures around prevention, early intervention, holding perpetrators to account and, particularly, ensuring that children are also seen as victim-survivors in their own right. We know how important is to address all of these issues. We also have a strong focus on supporting the safety of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women; taking action on sexual violence; supporting the economic security of victim-survivors; and supporting women on temporary visas and victim-survivors of trafficking. This package also includes $159 million of additional funding for states and territories to support frontline service delivery, under the family, domestic and sexual violence national partnership, and we've committed over $262 million towards measures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and children, through our dedicated action plan. Our investment in this year's budget is of course on top of our record investment of $1.7 billion in women's safety, which we saw in the October budget, bringing our total investment to over $2 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, we have a national focus on leadership when it comes to making sure that we can end that violence against women and children in one generation. I know that every member of this House shares in that goal, in terms of achieving it. It's vitally important for the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300006" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHANEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  I appreciate this opportunity to ask questions of the government in relation to the social security budget. My first questions are to the Minister for Social Services. The government created an economic inclusion advisory committee to provide advice in the lead-up to budgets on policies to address disadvantage and boost economic participation. I have two questions about this committee. Firstly, when will the government introduce legislation to establish this committee as a permanent committee, and who will be appointed to it? Secondly, will the government implement or respond to recommendations of the committee, and, if so, in what time frame? The committee found the current rates of JobSeeker and related payments were seriously inadequate. It recommended restoring the relativities of the mid-1990s, when employment benefits were about 90 per cent of the age pension. ACOSS has issued an open letter calling for this $19 a day increase. This has been signed by a huge range of MPs, community leaders, economists, prominent leaders and academics. The BCA and CEDA backed this change too. ANU analysis shows that we could increase government spending by about one per cent and lift a million people out of poverty. I acknowledge that we need to address the structural deficit in the budget. Inflation affects everyone. But, in a budget of $680 billion, surely we can find $6 billion so that all Australians can be fed and housed and live with dignity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My next question is to the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The NDIS will cover 600,000 people this month; it is forecast to increase to more than a million people by 2032 and cost close to $100 billion annually. The NDIS is a fundamentally important part of our welfare system and will need to be sustainable on an ongoing basis. So I ask the minister: what's being done to address the sustainability challenges for the NDIS over the coming decades?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My final questions are addressed to the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness. The Housing Australia Future Fund is a small piece of the puzzle when it comes to the challenges we face on housing. It's understandable that successive governments have shied away from addressing underlying affordability issues, because the decline in house prices is politically unpalatable for those who are already in the housing market as owners or investors. We need to take a long-term view, and my question for the minister is whether she'll listen to the suggestion put by the crossbench and support a citizens' assembly on housing so we have new reform ideas on the table for the next budget and the government has permission to drive some longer term reform so people can reasonably aspire to put a roof over their heads and eventually own their own homes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the relevant ministers to address these questions to ensure that we are, in fact, giving people a fair go and that we'll be able to continue to do this in the future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  It has been just over one year since the Albanese Labor government was sworn into office. We've been getting to work, repairing our global reputation and diversifying our trade. While we've seen good progress, we continue to operate in a challenging global environment, but more trade, not less, is a key part of how we build the secure and stable economic future we all want. More trade means more well-paying jobs, more national income and more opportunities for businesses and workers. Trade helps enable the economic strength and resilience that, alongside defence and diplomacy, are central to our national power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year Australia recorded a $15 billion trade surplus. A trade surplus means Australian exporters are doing well, and when exporters do well, so does our budget. Our decision to return 80 per cent of revenue upgrades, including those from strong export earnings, back to the budget helps us pay back the trillion dollars of debt we inherited from the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade translates into jobs. One in four Australian jobs is connected to trade. The pandemic restrictions demonstrated that the movement of people holds the same strategic and economic value as a movement of goods and services. That's why in tourism, one of our largest services exports pre-COVID, we're supporting the return of international visitors. The government continues to invest in a range of initiatives that will support the sustainable growth of the visitor economy. The budget included more than $260 million of new funding in our iconic national parks, such as Kakadu and Uluru-Kata Tjuta, to support tourism, conservation and cultural heritage activities; up to $3.4 billion over 10 years of investment in world-class infrastructure for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games; and a $535 million investment in our national collecting institutions, strengthening Australia's cultural infrastructure, which is a key pillar of the government's new cultural policy. We're also providing an additional $204 million to the Great Barrier Reef, delivering on our election commitment to spend a record $1.2 billion to protect, manage and restore the reef in Queensland. The Great Barrier Reef is one of Australia's top tourist destinations, which is why, as part of our record investment, we have launched the $15.1 million Great Barrier Reef Tourism Reef Protection Initiative. These are just some of the measures in the 2023-24 budget that will support tourism and the attractions and events that bring international visitors to our shores. Of course, we're continuing to deliver the $48 million package announced in the October 2022 budget, which is designed to help bring international visitors back, strengthen the industry workforce and support quality tourism products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years ahead, we know that international trade, including our visitor economy, must continue to be a driver of Australian prosperity. Our government is working hard to share the benefits of that prosperity as widely as possible through the community. One of our biggest priorities has been to stabilise our relationship with China, Australia's largest trading partner. We want a stable and prosperous trading relationship and the full resumption of trade. Visits to China by the Prime Minister, followed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Trade and Tourism, are showing promising signs of progress. Australia and China have agreed to step up dialogue under our existing free trade agreement to resolve the outstanding trade impediments. China recently announced it would resume imports of Australian timber, as well as stone fruit. That follows positive developments in coal, cotton, and copper ores and concentrates. We want to see all remaining trade impediments removed as soon as possible. As a Western Australian, that is also very important for the people who fish for crayfish off the coast of Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, overreliance on any single trading partner comes with risks, so our government is actively pursuing a trade diversification agenda, including by entering new and comprehensive free trade agreements. Just last month the Australia-UK FTA entered into force, with 99 per cent of Australian goods now entering the UK completely tariff free. Negotiations are moving swiftly to boost our trade agreement with India, the largest growing economy in the world, with a market of 1.4 billion people. And the Minister for Trade and Tourism has just returned from Europe following intensive negotiations on the Australia-Europe free trade agreement. This new trade deal means growth, investment, jobs and higher wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also deepening our engagement with South-East Asia, including through our Southeast Asia Economic Strategy to 2040. We've also committed $31.9 million in developing the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. That will include key trade and economic partners across seven ASEAN nations, India, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Fiji and the United States. It's a very important initiative and will help advance Australia's trade and economic interests, including in digital and green trade and strengthening regional supply chains. IPEF is important to Australia's geo-economic interests and the key trade and economic agreement that will bring the United States well back into the Indo-Pacific region. We are a safe, reliable and trusted trade partner.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>):  I'm going to focus on the foreign affairs side of this consideration in detail. It's on a very serious matter: Russia's illegal, abhorrent and appalling invasion of Ukraine. I've got a series of questions that I would like the government to answer. First of all is: why is there no additional funding for humanitarian support for Ukraine in this budget? Senate estimates hearings were told by DFAT that the coalition government, in March last year, was the last government to provide any funding for humanitarian support for Ukraine. Why aren't the government providing that support?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second question is: why hasn't the government joined the other 60 nations who have reopened an embassy in Kyiv? What is the government waiting for? Sixty nations have opened embassies in Kyiv, and yet we are still waiting for the Australian embassy to open. Why? Let's get real about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third question I'd like answered is: why hasn't the government issued a single sanction against Russia under Australia's Magnitsky cyber sanctions arrangements? We know that Australia joined the UK and US in February last year in publicly attributing cyberattacks against Ukraine to the Russian main intelligence unit. More than 15 months later, DFAT confirmed to estimates hearings last week that the government is still yet to issue a single sanction using the Magnitsky cyber sanctions. What is going on? Why won't you act?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth question that I would like to ask is: does the government think that Australians and Ukrainians deserve to be informed on the Australian government's long-term strategic plan for Australia's support for Ukraine? Why hasn't the government made any commitment on this? Where is your plan to continue to help Ukraine? Does the government understand that there is a major offensive going on at the moment by Ukraine against the Russians and that what the Ukrainians want is some sort of long-term plan and commitment from the Australian government to help and support in that regard? In particular, when will the government announce their military support for Ukraine, or is the government waiting for a photo opportunity at the upcoming NATO summit? Is that what is driving this government when it comes to support for Ukraine? When will we get some answers to these questions?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The United States this week authorised the 40th draw-down for Ukraine, which will deliver US$325 million worth of military assistance. Why aren't we contributing and why aren't we joining forces with the US to provide that military assistance? We know that the Ukrainian community here in Australia want the government to act. They've written to the government and asked them to act, yet they are drawing absolute blanks from the government. And if they are waiting, and waiting needlessly, because there is going to be some sort of photo opportunity at NATO, is beyond the pale, considering what is going on, on the ground, at this very moment. What we want to see from the government is some transparency. Why aren't you providing the humanitarian support? Why aren't you using your cyber Magnitsky sanctions to take on the Russians? Why aren't you opening the embassy in Kyiv? Why aren't you providing and announcing that military assistance for Ukraine at this moment? They are the questions that all Australians want answered, that the Ukrainian communities here in Australia want answered, yet they are drawing complete blanks, and no-one can understand why. The war continues. It is incredibly important for the West, for democracies, that we defeat the Russians on the ground. This illegal and abhorrent invasion needs to be tackled head-on because the message it would send across the world would be that this type of behaviour will never ever be tolerated by the West and that we will fight it to the nth degree. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am looking forward to the responses from the government to these questions. That is what consideration in detail is all about, and I am looking forward to the minister, who is standing up now, to answer these questions.</span>

We see Australia as being part of the Pacific family, a Pacific family with shared values, a shared history and with shared challenges and shared opportunities. Many countries in the Pacific have faced longstanding challenges such as economic underdevelopment, geographic isolation and environmental pressures on the Blue Pacific Ocean that sustains us all. These issues are now exacerbated by new challenges like the aftermath of the COVID pandemic, the profound threat that climate change poses to low-lying island states and countries which are vulnerable to extreme weather events, as well as new security challenges like transnational crime, cyber threats, environmental and resource security and a dynamic geopolitical environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government wants to tackle these challenges in a genuine partnership with Pacific countries and their regional institutions, a genuine partnership where we listen, show respect and take action. That is why ministers, including the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and I, have engaged extensively with our Pacific counterparts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government came to office with the most comprehensive Pacific package taken to an election by an Australian political party. In our first year in office we have made significant progress in implementing these policies. We are addressing Pacific development challenges by boosting Australian official development assistance for Pacific countries by $900 million over four years from 2022-23. Under this year's budget, Australia will provide $1.9 billion in official development assistance to the Pacific in 2023-24. That makes us by far the region's biggest development partner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's aid investments materially improve the lives of people in Pacific countries. They support economic growth, improve health and education, tackle issues like gender equality and improve the lives of people with disabilities. We are addressing the region's climate change challenges through a new Pacific infrastructure financing partnership to support climate adaptation and infrastructure projects. We are amplifying Pacific voices' international climate change negotiations by bidding to co-host a 2026 United Nations climate conference with our Pacific partners and by supporting Vanuatu's request for an International Court of Justice advisory opinion on climate change. We are addressing Pacific economic challenges by expanding and improving the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility Scheme, which allows Pacific Islanders to come to work in Australia. When we came to government in May '22, there were 24,496 farm workers in Australia. That number had grown to 38,180 by April 2023, an increase of 55 per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, in our first year the Albanese government has also addressed Pacific security challenges. We have doubled funding for aerial surveillance under the Pacific Maritime Security Program to help tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. We have established a new Australia Pacific Defence School to provide training for members of Pacific defence and security forces. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's priority is to ensure the blue Pacific remains peaceful, prosperous and equipped to respond to the challenges of our times. That is why the May budget has built on the policies implemented over the last year with a new whole-of-government Pacific package. This package includes $370.8 million over four years to continue expanding and improving the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility program. These new PALM measures will deliver improved skills for farmworkers, country liaison workers and stronger worker protections and compliance operations in Australia. The May budget also includes a further $1.4 billion over four years to support the Pacific family first approach to peace and security, which has been embraced by Pacific Island Forum leaders. These Pacific security measures will support delivery of security infrastructure and maritime security, capabilities and sustainment. They will boost the Australian Federal Police's partnership with the Pacific family to support Pacific law enforcement and criminal justice initiatives, and the budget will provide additional support for Pacific cyberresilience. The May budget will also improve Australian cultural links with the Pacific by expanding access to Australian media content, boosting media connections through the Indo-Pacific broadcasting strategy and building on our shared love of sport. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is investing in the long-term security of our region and responding to Pacific priorities. We are bringing new energy, new resources and new policies to help build a more secure region and a stronger and more united Pacific family. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  Can I make an observation before I start? The Labor government said they would respect parliamentary process and would be more transparent and more open with all these lovely words. But a lot of things they have done in the parliament since coming to government have been exactly the opposite, consideration in detail being one of those things. Consideration in detail when we were in government was respected as a debate and as a robust process where people would ask questions and the minister would hang around and answer them. Under the Labor government this has become a bit of a debacle. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To go to the issue of trade, I invite one of the four Labor members opposite me to mention the words 'coal, gas and iron ore' together in a sentence and say what economic and trading powerhouses those three industries are. Those industries have funded the budget surplus that was mentioned. Those three powerhouse industries in round figures are around $100 billion industries, and the royalties they pay are high, as we saw in the Queensland government's budget yesterday. Those industries pay royalties and taxes, and the workers in those industries pay taxes as they earn, so they are economic powerhouses for this country. But the Treasurer in his budget speech could not even mention the word ''coal', the word 'gas' or the words 'iron ore'. He just talked about 'the things that we sell overseas'. He couldn't even bring himself to say what they were, although, as we know, old Labor loved these industries. Your predecessors loved them, and you guys have turned your back on blue-collar workers in those industries and want to shut half of them down. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My first question is that I would love one of those four opposite to get up when they speak in the next 25 minutes and congratulate and thank the blue-collar workers in those industries. And why don't they speak? We know it's because Labor these days has turned into a lot of inner-city trendies, and they do not like those industries. I encourage one of them to have the courage to get up and thank the workers in those industries, which, as I said, are the economic powerhouse of our country right now. The other major thing going on is that in government we did free trade agreements, which lifted the amount of goods and services carried by FTAs when we came to government in 2013 from about 25 per cent to nearly 80 per cent when we left government, once you take into account both the UK deal and the India deal we did just before we left government. Again, those free trade agreements are the other things that are driving the economic powerhouse that we now are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was one major deal left to do, and that is the European Union deal. Labor members were laughing earlier, so I would like someone to address this next question as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have geographical indicators that some of the sectors of our economy don't want to be given up, so I ask someone opposite to pay this process in the parliament respect and answer this question: is the government considering grandfathering the use of GIs, including prosecco? It was mentioned in Senate estimates that that may be looked at. Now, the prosecco industry have told me they don't want grandfathering to be considered. It causes a lot of distortions in the market, and they want the right to trade with those names even if they were to sell a business or expand a business. Again, to pay this process respect, I would like one of you opposite to get up and answer that question. Are you ruling out free trade agreements grandfathering GIs such as the words 'prosecco', 'feta' and others?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have never been good at free trade agreements—half of them don't really believe in them—so I also ask that you not sell out our farmers. In most deals that are done, there is complete liberalisation of access for things like beef, sheepmeat, dairy and sugar. We're not talking quotas here; we're talking complete liberalisation. I ask someone opposite, if they're going to pay this process any due respect: are you aiming for complete liberalisation in those deals? One thing we had with the EU people in negotiations was critical minerals like lithium, which are very important to them. We should not be blinking. We should be getting a good deal for those people. Again, is someone happy to use coal, gas and iron ore in a sentence, and are you ruling out grandfathering GIs? It'd be nice to get a specific answer to a question.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:06</span>):  There's no better way to strengthen security, stability and regional prosperity than through properly designed, delivered development assistance, which of course depends on a skilful and properly supported Australian aid program. Dollar for dollar, we achieve more in building peace and avoiding conflict, in promoting good government and fair trade through development assistance, than by any other means. Every sensible person knows that. There was a quite unsensible person who just left this place. That's why it's so welcome that the Albanese government is returning Australia to its historical role as a focused and supportive development partner after a decade in which that role and responsibility were stupidly and callously abandoned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government started its life by inflicting the most savage and senseless funding cuts to Australia's aid program in living memory. One of their first acts was to dissolve our standalone development assistance agency, which, as anyone could imagine, had a seriously negative impact on the expertise, knowledge and culture that had accumulated over years and which had been the basis of an aid program that was independently rated as world-leading. At the outset, the coalition cut $1 billion, or approximately 20 per cent, from our ODA program. The 2015-16 budget saw the largest cut to Australia's aid program in our history. Over the life of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, $11.8 billion was scandalously pulled out of development assistance. For a government that ran up a trillion dollars in debt and was incapable of prudence or restraint, the billions they ripped out of our aid program remains one of the largest spending cuts they achieved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2010, while a conservative Cameron government in the UK made it clear that they wouldn't seek to balance the books on the backs of the poorest people, the former coalition government delivered a sequence of deficits and a mountain of debt while also inflicting deeply harmful cuts on the poorest people in our region and the robodebt debacle on the poorest and most vulnerable Australians. And what did those cuts mean? They meant that fewer lives were saved. They meant that hundreds of thousands of people suffered aching poverty that could have been alleviated, including poverty in the form of disease, dirty water and malnutrition, which have a particularly acute and lasting impact on the lives of children and young mothers. They meant that our standing in our Pacific and South-East Asian region suffered as neighbours saw us withdraw support and heard the coalition government denying and even joking about the impacts of climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all those reasons, it was no surprise that, by the end of the Morrison government, we'd begun to face the consequences of that deterioration in Australia's regional standing. It was no surprise that Australia was no longer seen as the reliable and responsive partner of choice. We shouldn't have been surprised when there was preparedness by countries that face acute development challenges to consider support from other places, including through agreements with China that would have seriously compromised the open and self-determining character of the Pacific.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia can and should be an influential middle power not just in our region but especially in our region. The Albanese government sees that clearly. The government and the minister, who is here with us tonight, recognise that our national interests and our national values should be projected through all the features of our engagement with the wider world, through diplomacy, defence, development assistance and fair trade. That's why the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong; the assistant minister, the member for Gellibrand; and the Minister for International Development and the Pacific, the member for Shortland—in addition to, of course, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister—have turned themselves inside out to re-engage with our regional neighbours and to re-engage with the wider world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why this first budget of the Albanese Labor government is providing the single biggest increase to the development assistance budget since 2011-12. It's because we know there needs to be a long-term rebuild of our aid program. We're committed to year-on-year growth in the ODA budget. We're investing $37 million in expanding DFAT's capability to provide an ambitious, effective, targeted and responsible development program. We are increasing funding to the Pacific and to South-East Asia, and we're making sure there is a strong focus on climate change, on women, on people with disability and on regional and global health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do we do this? We do this because it's absolutely in our national interest. It will make Australia safer. It will contribute to a more stable and more prosperous region. But it's also the right thing to do. It's an expression of our values as a nation—that we'll always look to lift up those who face tough circumstances and who face aching disadvantage.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  The Pacific Australia Labor Mobility scheme was established under the coalition government and has proven successful not only for helping Australia but also in helping Pacific countries. Through that mutual benefit, it has strengthened our ties and brought countries closer together. I'm pleased to see the government agrees this scheme is a good idea and has announced it will devote more than $370 million to expanding the scheme to build on what we began. I would like to ask the minister how he believes the scheme can expand at pace and what safeguards are in place to ensure quantity is not sacrificed for quality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask this because I have grave concerns the Labor government is racing ahead on many avenues without doing due diligence. Many of the policies they've rushed through in the past 12 months across various portfolios might initially conjure up warm and fuzzy feelings and photo opportunities but in actuality are having dire consequences. The superficiality of their governing style demonstrates a breathtaking lack of depth of thought, analysis and long vision and is completely devoid of nuance and complexity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A prime example of this is the reforms to the PALM scheme. They have taken a perfectly good scheme—which, yes, should always be improved and finessed—and they have butchered it to such an extent that farmers are now threatening to boycott the program altogether. Under Labor, farmers would have to pay Pacific workers for a minimum of 30 hours a week every week. It might sound nice to those in the inner city. It might sound like good policy, but what the government is failing to get is that ultimately these jobs are seasonal. They are weather dependent. Farmers during a harvest might work a 12-hour day and the next day be stuck inside. The PALM scheme must remain flexible to that, which is why the 30 hours averaged over eight weeks proved popular. The changes to the scheme were clearly made without adequate consultation with our stakeholders. Industry has loudly said the myriad changes to the scheme are no longer workable. My question to the minister is: will the government go back to the drawing board and re-engage with stakeholders to find a better solution? I would also like to know if each Pacific country involved with PALM has been supportive of the reforms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On remittance, remaining on the Pacific, I do want to speak to the vital and positive impact the PALM scheme has in workers' home countries. According to the World Bank figures, 44 per cent of Tonga's gross domestic product is made up by remittance sent home by those working abroad. In Samoa it's 30 per cent, in Vanuatu it's 21 per cent and in Fiji it's nine per cent. Roughly 15 per cent of each migrant worker's pay cheque is sent back home, with Australian government figures suggesting this amount could be as high as 40 per cent. The problem is that about 10 per cent of that amount is then lost in foreign exchange, meaning that tens of millions of dollars that could be going back to the Pacific are not. Many banks will argue there are zero upfront fees charged to the individual, but what we see is a hefty slice of the pie taken through inflated exchange rates. My question to the government is: other than a box-ticking website, what is the government really doing to address the lack of transparency banks are providing to hardworking Pacific Islanders?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's ODA to GNI percentage in 2022-23 was 0.20 percent. This coming year, it will fall to 0.19 percent—which represents a historic low.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the May 2023 budget the government published a commitment to $8.6 billion in new and additional ODA over 10 years, starting from 2026-27. This goes well beyond the four-year forwards published by Treasury. My question to the government is: how can it actually forecast to 2036-37 when there are so many variables at play? Is this simply a ploy to make the government appear more generous than it really is? I would appreciate, respectfully, an answer to those questions from the minister.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  It's a longstanding Labor tradition to anchor Australia's identity and find our security in our immediate region. This recognises the essential facts of who we are and where we are. At the last census in 2021, 17.4 per cent of our population identified as having Asian ancestry. This represented a seven per cent increase in just five years. In the 2006 census, it was 10.4 per cent, and now it's 17.4 per cent in just five years. That's massive. Asian Australians make a formidable contribution across our nation's boardrooms, businesses and other organisations. This government is proud to count among its leaders the first Malaysian Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Penny Wong, as well as other outstanding Asian Australians in this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our foreign minister has reinvigorated our relationships by visiting every ASEAN country—except Myanmar, for obvious reasons—and every Pacific Islands Forum member in our first year of government. Australia is also a part of Asia by virtue of our strategic reality. We are an Indo-Pacific country at the confluence of the Indian and Pacific oceans. We are a founding member of APEC and of the East Asia Summit, and we were ASEAN's first dialogue partner. We have close strategic partners in Japan, Indonesia, India, the Philippines, Singapore and others across our region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was stoked to assist in strengthening these partnerships recently at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, where I accompanied the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister earlier this month. Representing Australia on an important regional stage was a reminder of the importance of building Asian literacy here at home. Sadly, we have gone backwards domestically in the teaching of Asian languages. The teaching of Bahasa Indonesia in particular has, very regrettably, been in net decline in Australian universities in recent years. Only 755 students learn Indonesian in Australian high schools, and that's down 50 per cent on a decade ago. This decline should be urgently stemmed and reversed. I learned Bahasa Indonesia at the Australian National University and then in the Army, and I regularly use it in meetings with Indonesian stakeholders in the course of my duties both in the parliament and around the country and region. Even a few words in the language of another culture signals enormous respect. I'm nowhere near fluent, but at the Shangri-La Dialogue my Bahasa was acknowledged by an Indonesian minister. So it is noticed and it is appreciated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sports diplomacy is another key tool for fashioning strong, endurable relationships within the region. During my recent visit to New Zealand and Samoa, two big rugby-loving countries, I raised the importance of deepening sports-diplomacy initiatives in the Pacific in meetings, and there was great interest in this. When I briefly met Fiji's Prime Minister Rabuka, during his visit to New Zealand last week, I invited him, humbly, to participate in the Parliamentary Rugby World Cup in late August in Paris. He is going to be over there watching the Fijian national team, obviously. Sport is a language we share with our Pacific family, and it's not just rugby union but other sports as well: rugby league and many others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">DFAT is leading this national effort with PacificAus Sports. This is an investment of $15.6 million non-ODA and $2.5 million ODA per annum. It aims to strengthen regional sporting connections and create new opportunities for Pacific athletes. And Team Up is a $6 million ODA per annum program involving over 60 partners, delivering sport for development programs across 13 sports in Fiji, Nauru, PNG, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu. It focuses on gender, disability, leadership and governance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Arts diplomacy is another area where we can do more, and I'd like to highlight, in the seconds remaining, the Bali Artists Camp which has involved, over a period of time, Balinese artists coming to the Northern Territory and Aboriginal Territorians going to Bali. So cultural diplomacy and sports diplomacy are incredibly strong.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  I would like to ask: where is the Minister for Home Affairs? I find this deeply disappointing. I've been a member of this place for seven years, and for six of those years, I've got to say, the minister fronted and responded to questions. We had a previous assistant minister here. He did not respond to any of the questions from this side of the House, and now we have another assistant minister here. With the greatest of respect, the Minister for Home Affairs should be here to hear this. I hope that we have the minister here when we continue this tomorrow. It was the same earlier today with respect to health; we did not have the Minister for Health and Aged Care or the Minister for Aged Care attending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to raise a couple of issues that are of concern to my electorate. We are in a housing crisis. I think that is very well known. My community is quite concerned that we have more than 331 households who are already experiencing rental stress, and vacancies in my electorate are less than 0.5 per cent in many areas. Yet we know, from the budget, that there is going to be increased pressure because overseas net migration is predicted to increase by 650,000 people over the next two financial years. I'm well known, and on the record in this place, for supporting the refugee intake and, in fact, looking to having it increased, but what we're going to see, with 650,000 new people coming over a two-year period, is that the challenges we're having with housing are only going to be exacerbated. And the hardship that that's going to place on Australians is going to be enormous. It's quite a foolish thing to do at this time when we have such a shocking vacancy rate in Australia. The budget does provide for funding for return to levels of migration at the lower end of 190,000 people per year, but when we're talking about 650,000 over the next two years the inflationary pressures that that will cause will be enormous. We've already had 12 consecutive rate rises, and I can't see how Australians are expected to cope with this. What commitment can the government give that its immigration intake will not add to inflationary pressures and will not, consequently, affect the availability of housing?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to talk about the ACCC and the oversight of the airline industry. Under direction from the Australian government, the ACCC has been monitoring and reporting on the domestic airline industry over the last three years. This arrangement expires in June this year. This is despite continued poor performance in arrival times, cancellations and above-average airfares and despite record profits. International airfares remain 50 per cent higher on average than in 2019. Domestic fares remain 17 per cent higher in nominal terms than at the same time in 2019. It's not surprising, when 94 per cent of all domestic travel is undertaken by the Qantas group and Virgin Australia, a duopoly of epic proportions. Will the government continue the ACCC oversight of the airline industry? If not, what measures will the government implement to ensure consumers can be confident of a competitive airline sector?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to briefly touch upon skilled migration and the effect on the Pacific nations. I'm a big supporter of the PALM scheme. I've met with many people from Vanuatu and Fiji in my community. The Pacific engagement visa is an important program, but there is a great concern that there is a brain drain with that when we are offering permanent residency to people and they're not returning to their communities, after spending time in Australia, with greater skills and experience. So my question to the government is: is this a concern you have? Many feel that this is potentially an unintended consequence of the program. How will the government provide the necessary assistance to our Pacific neighbours to accommodate for the loss of skills through this and similar programs? Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:26</span>):  We know that Australia lives in challenging times. Strategic competition in our region, the Indo-Pacific, is increasing, and domains that were previously considered separate—economic, diplomatic, strategic, military—are converging. Events in our region and beyond have shown, as well, that peace is not a guarantee and will become harder to maintain in the future. The Albanese government, though, is working to shape a region that is stable, peaceful, prosperous and predictable; a region where sovereignty is protected, where countries can make their own choices, where no country dominates and no country is dominated; and, importantly, a region that is governed by rules, norms and international law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A region like this doesn't just emerge on its own. It requires active investment from all countries in the region, including Australia. It requires diplomacy. It requires us to build our defence capability and our ability to contribute to collective security in our region. It requires strengthening Australia's economic security, building our resilience, our sovereign capabilities, at home. The Albanese government is deploying all elements of our national power to make Australia stronger at home and more influential in the world. We won't be content to be mere commentators, mere spectators, to the changes going on around Australia. We're engaging to shape the world around us, and our budget makes responsible investments to mitigate the threats that we face and to seize the opportunities that are presented to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming into office, the Albanese government has worked to rectify a decade of underfunding and resourcing neglect at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The previous government failed to ensure long-term resourcing for our diplomatic capability. A wasted decade saw Australia's diplomatic footprint shrink at the worst possible time. The previous government also failed to provide ongoing funding for critical aspects of our diplomacy and national security, to the detriment of the national interest. The previous government provided no ongoing funding for the interim mission in Afghanistan, for overseas leases of embassies, for the foreign arrangements scheme and for many more. And what did their failure leave us with? A slew of commitments with none of the funding needed to deliver them. Australians deserved better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of our efforts to restore both the capability and the leadership of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We've brought the department back into the centre of government decision-making and of Australia's engagement with the world, where it belongs. We're investing in our diplomats. They are our people on the ground, who put our foreign policy into action. Our budget will better enable Australia's diplomatic network to shape the region and advance our interests. So, in this increasingly contested environment, the Albanese government is investing to lift the capability of our diplomats in the Indo-Pacific. I wish that all Australians could see the enormous capability of our people across our diplomatic network. I'm privileged in my role as Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs to have seen Australian diplomats at work in dozens of countries, and I wish all Australians could see them. They'd be so proud of the people representing us and the capabilities that they have. They are our frontline of engagement with the world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our diplomats are our instruments of influence, and they've achieved a lot in the last year. Our diplomats worked around the clock to help Australians and their families returned home from the conflict in Sudan. They successfully assisted over 300 Australians and their families to evacuate from a very dangerous civil conflict. They successfully advocated and worked to bring Professor Sean Turnell back to Australia after 21 months of unjust detention in Myanmar. As we speak, they are working tirelessly at all hours of every day to provide consular support to Australians who face difficult situations overseas. Our diplomats have worked and continue to work with partners around the world to respond to Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine, to counter Russian lies and to deliver justice for Ukraine and its people. Our Australian Passport Office staff have successfully resolved the backlog of passport applications that we inherited from the failure and the lack of planning of the previous government. Passport processing rates are back to what they were before the COVID pandemic.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our diplomats advance Australia's interest in every corner of the globe. That's why the Albanese government will continue to invest in our diplomats. We will continue to advance our interests around the world, shape the region that Australia exists in and build a region that's peaceful, prosperous and secure—a region that operate on rules, norms and international law, a region where all countries, including countries like Australia, exercise their sovereignty and their own choices, because if we don't do it, other countries will.</span>
