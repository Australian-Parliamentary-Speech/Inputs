         —The amendments which the government is now acceding to are those in relation to the tax on building materials, which were moved here when the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (Excise) Bill 1995 was before the House on a previous occasion.

         I say it is an indication of that adage because one might recall the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) standing at this dispatch box on Monday, the start of this week, with all his usual arrogance. He said that the blockage of these measures through the opposition's voting against them in the Senate would lead to an increase in interest rates in this country. In answer to a question on Monday, the Prime Minister said:

        I notice that the National Australia Bank on Friday night reduced its fixed rate from over 9 1/4 per cent to under nine per cent—8.75 per cent. If those sorts of declines that we have seen in interest rates and in the long-term bond rate—which has come from 10.1 to now 8.8 per cent—are not further compounded and consolidated, then, as a consequence, the guilty person will be J.W. Howard. He will be the person standing in the way of falling interest rates for Australians.

        That is what the Prime Minister of this country said on Monday this week when he stood at the dispatch box here with all his usual insufferable arrogance. This measure was going to blow out the budget, change the current account deficit, force up interest rates and have all the dire consequences you could expect for Australia. But what do we have by the end of the week?

         On Thursday, an article in the

          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         referred to a speech made by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to the Economic Society of Australia in Melbourne. What did he say there? He did not say that this is going to force up interest rates. He did not say that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), who from opposition can dictate government policy, is going to be the most powerful opposition leader in the history of Australia. He said nothing of that sort.

         It is always interesting to hear what the Treasurer says. There is something about the Treasurer of this country which makes him different from the Prime Minister. There is a modicum of integrity, decency and plain truth in what the Treasurer says. The fact is that the Treasurer cannot quite tell a lie. He will not come in here and say that black is white when in fact it is the other way round. He will try to move around an answer as best he can, but he will not come in here and say barefaced that black is white when that is not the case. That is what we get from the Prime Minister. In the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         </emphasis>
         the Treasurer is reported as saying:

        So on Monday we had the Prime Minister saying that interest rates are going to go up because we blocked a tax that was not promised to the Australian people. He also said that this is going to have dire consequences for the Australian economy and the Australian people. In fact, we are blocking a tax which the government sought to impose on the Australian people. This comes after the last election when the Prime Minister said, `What I am promising is not to put up taxes. Not only am I promising that but it is l-a-w, law that there will be no increases in tax.'

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         He then comes along with a raft of tax increases—including on building materials and cars and increases in the corporate tax rate—and we said, `Enough is enough. How about a bit of integrity in politics in this country?' After the Prime Minister had said what he did on Monday at the dispatch box with all his usual arrogance, we then got the Treasurer saying by Thursday that it is not actually going to have those consequences for the people of Australia and that it is not really going to have a dramatic impact on policy. What the Treasurer did not say was that the Prime Minister was wrong and that as usual he was exaggerating things in his typical arrogant way. That is the code for what the Treasurer was saying to the economists.

         So on Monday of this long week of politics we had the Prime Minister standing up here and saying that somehow the actions of the opposition, by keeping the government to its word, were going to have dire economic consequences for the people of this country and then on Thursday the Treasurer saying that this is not going to have any major impact on policy at all. That gives us an indication of the rhetoric of the Prime Minister in this place this week. He is searching around frantically for a target to aim at. He has fired off his republic. He has fired off on his Accord. He has fired off here, there and everywhere using a scatter gun approach but he has no target. He knows it and he looks increasingly desperate as he stands in here.

         The reason for opposing this measure is most important. We will continue to remind the people of Australia of those reasons from now until the day the next election is called and the day the next election is held. How can you ever trust anything that the Leader of the Australian Labor Party says or any promises that he makes. The events of this week alone demonstrate that he will say anything, he will twist any words or statement and he will change any position in order to satisfy what he sees as being politically expedient at the time.

Now we find ourselves in this parliament considering legislation that will increase sales tax on a range of materials. I say to the people of Australia: how can you ever trust anything that this man says again?

         Remember what this particular measure is about. This is a measure which deals with sales tax on a whole range of ordinary household items. This is a measure which puts a 12 per cent sales tax on nuts, bolts, screws, taps, nozzles for showers, bathroom vanity units and kitchens. Under this measure, a whole range of ordinary household items is going to be taxed at 12 per cent. The Prime Minister says, `Well, at the last election you proposed a GST of 15 per cent on materials.' That is true, but at least we told the Australian people that that was what we were going to do.

Let me remind people of the increases in taxes which are going to occur surreptitiously, without fanfare, without comment and almost in secret tomorrow—1 July 1995. All wholesale sales tax rates will increase by one percentage point. The wholesale sales tax paid on a whole range of ordinary household items will be 22 per cent and 32 per cent. It is going up one per cent tomorrow. What will this bring in for the government in the 1995-96 taxation year? Some $600 million.

         The people of Australia will also remember the way the then Fraser-Howard government changed and mutilated Medibank after promising the Australian people at the 1975 and 1977 elections that Medibank would remain intact. Who can ever forget that at the time the Fraser-Howard government lost office in March 1983 we had double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and double digit interest rates. May I say categorically that the interest rate on a 90-day commercial bill in March 1983 through the Bank of New South Wales was 23 per cent. The highest income tax rate was 60c in the dollar. The lowest marginal income tax rate was 30c in the dollar. Company tax rates were 46c in the dollar. Above all, this government inherited a deficit in 1983 dollar terms of $9.6 billion—$9,600 million.

I have not heard them repudiate a goods and services tax, their pledge to cut $10,000 million from government expenditure or their pledge to dramatically render upheaval in the industrial relations system in this country by cutting youth wages to $3 an hour, or $3.50 an hour depending on the age of the employee.

         We have two shadow ministers at the table here this morning. I am going to put a question to them. They should think about it very carefully because this government has information about the antics of the opposition which they want to be very careful of. I ask them: will you pledge and guarantee that you will not introduce a goods and services tax in this House and impose a goods and services tax on the Australian people if you ever become a government? That is the question I put to the opposition, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition.

         That is the question the Australian people will demand be answered at the next election. I know the answer to that. We have information that those opposite will campaign deceitfully on this issue and that within two months, in the unlikely event that they ever gain government, they will impose a goods and services tax on the Australian people. They will not be allowed to run away from that issue. In every town and city and every street of every town in this country, the Australian people will be reminded that the Liberal and National parties stand for the introduction of a goods and services tax, probably at 15 per cent. I commend the bill to the House.

He did not even blush, did not even remember the words of a few months before when he said, `I will deal honestly with you and there will be no tax increases.'

Maybe wholesale sales tax does not mean a great deal until you start to analyse the cost increases for the average mum and dad and average family. Wholesale sales tax affects us all. It is built into the cost of everything. For instance, wholesale sales tax has increased and is increasing the cost of motor cars. The man who promised to be honest and not to increase taxes has increased the tax on motor cars by 46 per cent.

That tax will be on biscuits, snack foods, popcorn, chips, muesli bars, health food bars, ice cream, ice blocks, candy and non-medicated throat lozenges. All of those things have got a sales tax on them. There are sales taxes on drinks, including fruit juice. Fruit juices have a wholesale sales tax on them. That is increasing tomorrow.

The Prime Minister is doing what he promised he would not do—right across the board. Now he wants, with this legislation, to put a tax on building materials. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has said, `No, we are not going to cop that. You have to live up to your promises at some stage in the history of this nation. You have had 12 years of breaking promises to the Australian people and we are going to stand up and oppose this new tax because you promised you would not bring it in.' We are going to stand up against you. I find it hard to follow the way the Senate makes decisions but, fortunately, some of the people in the Senate said they would agree with us. Today we have amended bills before the House of Representatives saying that the Senate will not allow the wholesale sales tax to go ahead. The Senate has blocked the legislation. Back in the House of Representatives the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said, `We are not going to push it. We are going to have to agree with you and so the government is not going to go ahead with those wholesale sales taxes.'

         So here are the Democrats saying that they will not accept a modest extension of the sales tax regime to building materials to raise just over $200 million of federal revenue, but they will support a new regressive, indirect tax of $3 billion on imports, including imported building materials. This is opportunism and populism at its very worst. It demonstrates that the Democrats in the other place will only support economic and fiscal measures when they know they will never be implemented.

         The Democrats know the government would never implement a new $3 billion regressive, indirect tax on imports including imported building materials, so they are willing to put it forward to demonstrate some fiscal plan. But, when it comes to a fiscal measure which tries to even out the imbalance on the taxation treatment of various forms of savings in Australia, the Democrats are in there playing to populist tendencies in the electorate; they are thinking that, with an election coming on, they need to preserve their place and numbers in the Senate.

         As I mentioned at the outset, it is very useful for the House—and I encourage the opposition to take this on—to consider the proper role of the Senate on budgetary matters. I am a great believer that, with the internationalisation of the Australian economy, rapid movements in capital and rapid fluctuations in business confidence, it is very important and in the national interest for the executive government to run the economy. It is not an unusual or complex proposition that the government should run economic and fiscal policy. In that respect, the Senate should accept its proper role.

         We are always being lectured by the opposition—and it has been party to this in the Senate—about the proper conventions and practice of the Australian constitution. In the Australian constitution a hundred years ago, determined by the conventions, the Senate was given more power on money bills and more power on fiscal measures than would normally be the case in a Westminster system. This was done because the smaller colonies, which were soon to become states, feared that a government may discriminate against them on fiscal measures. Therefore, they wanted some extra powers in the states house to guard against that.

         The closest we came was when Senator Panizza from Western Australia said he opposed the extension of sales tax to a small range of building materials because he owns a lot of properties in Perth. So more self-interest than state interest was expressed by that senator. The only other senator who came close was Senator Ian Macdonald from Queensland who expressed opposition to these measures because he owns an old home, a Queenslander type home, in the north of Queensland that requires a lot of renovation, and he did not want to pay the extra cost on the building materials through this sales tax measure. So, again, the issues raised by senators were closer to self-interest and pecuniary interest than any concern for state interests.

There is no more important task for the national government than to run the economy and to run an effective fiscal policy. The states house should not be allowed to misuse and abuse its role. It should recognise that if the people's house—the House of Representatives—passes a budget measure, according to the will of the people, then the Senate should also pass it. Both major parties, the coalition and the Labor Party in this place, should recognise the need to repeat the commitment the Prime Minister gave prior to the last election.

         I turn to the substance of what the Australian Democrats—the same Democrats who supported a $3 billion new indirect regressive tax on imports—have had to say. The Democrats are rejecting a modest sales tax extension to building materials to raise over $200 million. They are doing this after one of the greatest housing booms in Australian history. From June 1991 to September 1994, almost 600,000 new homes were commenced in Australia. In September 1994, the variable mortgage interest rate was at its lowest in 20 years, at under nine per cent. From March 1992 to March 1995, Australian household indebtedness on housing rose by 72 per cent from $88 billion out to $152 billion. We have come off the largest housing boom in the history of the Australian economy.

If the minor parties are using what he calls spoiling and scragging tactics, it is because of his government's lack of integrity, and the government can take full responsibility for it. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) said earlier today that we have heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) say in this place that, if this bill does not go through and interest rates go up, it is the fault of everyone else except him. We have also heard the Treasurer (Mr Willis) refute the importance of getting this measure through the Senate and say that it will not have the kind of effect that the Prime Minister has more than alluded to in this place.

         The Prime Minister should rethink his comment to small business. About the same time as he was making those comments about this being the best it has ever been and this is the best it is ever going to be, the industry groups were doing some surveys. While the government was making the decisions about how it was going to tax Australians and who it was going to tax in this year's budget, it was also being given information by magazines such as the

         —The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (General) Bill is the third bill in a package of sales tax legislation that has been returned to the House of Representatives from the Senate. The requested amendments referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) indicate, in effect, the rejection by the Senate of this government's attempt to impose a 12 per cent sales tax on a range of building and housing materials such as nuts, bolts, nails, screws, nozzles, taps and vanity units—just about everything that goes into the building of a house apart from the timber on the walls and the tiles on the floor.

         The reason the Senate requested these amendments be made is the same reason coalition members in this place said they would vote against these measures and other taxation measures which the government sought to introduce. We voted against them because, prior to the last election, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said to the people of Australia in clear terms that he was going to introduce no new taxes.

         —Some government and some economy, as my colleague says. When this government was in opposition in 1983, did we hear the now Treasurer (Mr Willis) say those same things? Did he, as a member of the Labor Party in opposition, say, `We'll allow whatever comes from the Liberal-National Party coalition to go through the Senate untouched, unmentioned, without amendment, without request'? Of course he did not. In 1983, he was proposing to reject a whole raft of measures in the Senate that had come from the then government. If the member for Werriwa wants to get up in this place and say that the government should run the economy and that everything that goes from here to the Senate ought to go through automatically, then all I can suggest to him is a small lesson in history—because history indicates otherwise.

         In terms of running the economy, there is one basic underlying value that any government ought to employ and that I would have thought the people of Australia would expect from any government, and that value is integrity.

         When the Prime Minister of this country went to the election, he did not just say to the people of Australia, `Read my lips,' as George Bush did in his famous message to the American people, and, `This is a promise.' He also said, `There will be no new taxes,' and in relation to other matters, `This is l-a-w, law,' as he spelt out at the National Press Club. Yet, despite these words, he comes in here and introduces a whole raft of new taxes. In terms of running the economy, the basic issue is: where is the integrity of the government and where is the integrity of the Prime Minister? That is the fundamental issue in terms of running the economy.

         We are going to tax small business and small business people, who are struggling hard and who are not able to employ fellow Australians. Having worked in small business for the majority of my life, I can say that all small business people are well aware of the hidden taxes that come with our wholesale sales tax system. They are not happy. They are not happy because they will be unable to employ new staff; they will not be able to expand. It goes on. The excise on light fuel oils will raise $100 million. The Medicare levy will raise $230 million tomorrow on Mr Keating's billion-dollar tax day—the Keating sales tax day. An extra $60 per household per week will be raised in taxes.

They have gone now, but I say good luck to the fellas for tonight. They are going to need it against the Raiders. Tomorrow they will be paying an extra per cent tax on their sporting goods. Footballs and tennis racquets will go up. All sorts of things will go up. It is amazing.

        The Industry Research and Development Act 1986 is the legislative basis for a number of government programs which encourage research and development in industry.

         In 1987 this program was augmented by the introduction of syndication, which allows two or more eligible companies to register jointly for the concession. This development meant that the concession became available for those projects which were too large or too risky for a single company to undertake.

         The great strength of the tax concession is that it runs on self assessment principles which allows industry to respond to changes in the market as they occur. A company simply invests in the research and development it needs to pursue, and claims back 150 per cent of the cost of the eligible activities when it lodges its next tax return. This reduces the after tax cost of research and development to around 50 cents in the dollar.

As a result, the guidelines lapsed 15 sitting days after the guidelines were made. This was not brought to light until recently, and as a consequence, the Industry Research and Development Board has been making decisions using these lapsed guidelines in the belief that they were valid.

         The amendment bill also incorporates a time extension into the provisions covering the new grant approvals under the Industry Research and Development Act. The sunset clause amendment addresses the fact that the Industry Research and Development Board cannot enter into new grant agreements after 31 December 1995. The 1995-96 budget initiatives for the industry, science and technology portfolio included a commitment that the program would be extended to 30 June 1996 to allow the government sufficient time to respond to the Industry Commission inquiry into research and development. This is an extension of time only and does not represent an increase in the appropriation. I commend the bill to honourable members.

         In my previous capacity as the shadow minister for science, I commented on many occasions on the government's incompetence in science and the manner in which it was alienating scientists and discouraging industry involvement in research and development. In fact, the government's record in this area, despite the continuing rhetoric of success, is abysmal. The chronology of events in this matter only serves to highlight the incompetence abounding in the government's ministers for science. They have failed to properly manage their portfolios—the government's record in science and technology has been appalling—and their handling of the portfolio has seen a complete loss of faith in them and their ability to understand science generally and the research and development infrastructure needed in Australia.

         On 10 March 1993, finance scheme guidelines were sent to the minister's office and recommended for approval. The requirement that the instrument be gazetted was referred to, but no reference was made to tabling of the document. On 12 March 1993, the minister agreed to the recommendation. On 12 March 1993, the department's legal section advised the R&amp;D tax concession section that the guidelines had to be gazetted and tabled. The legal section believed that it had confirmed that the R&amp;D tax concession section was aware of this. The financial scheme guidelines were gazetted on 24 March 1993 but not tabled.

         On 7 May 1993, the Australian Taxation Office advised the tax concession branch that gazettal and laying of the instrument before both houses of parliament were necessary. On 6 October 1993, an information paper was provided to the tax concession committee on the finance scheme guidelines, which had been gazetted more than six months previously. This paper proposed revised guidelines and stated that these should be ready for tabling in the autumn sitting of parliament so that the revised guidelines could take effect from 1 July 1994. There was no mention of gazettal in this note.

         On 28 April 1994, officers of the department became aware that the guidelines had not been tabled in parliament and had therefore ceased to exist as far back as 1988. It was noted at that time that the guidelines could be challenged on the ground that they were not valid in accordance with the processes set out under the Acts Interpretation Act. It is apparent at this time that the department was aware that the guidelines had not been tabled as required and could therefore be deemed to be no longer in existence. It was proposed that the four guidelines which we are now considering under this bill be legitimated and that it might be useful to confirm that procedures necessary to give these instruments validity were complied with.

         Some two weeks later the tax concession committee sought advice on tabling the guidelines and an indication of when this could be done, if the IR&amp;D Board approved this action in December 1993. In October the IR&amp;D Board delegated its power under the IR&amp;D Act 1986 to undertake administrative matters relating to the tax concession cases before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to the tax concession committee. Minutes flew back and forth around the tax concession committee about the appropriate date for tabling and the timing of approval and signature by the IR&amp;D Board, and the tax concession committee was advised of a company claiming negligence on the part of the tax concession committee due to its refusal to approve a finance scheme.

This applicant submitted further schemes during December and had correspondence with the department and was advised on 16 December that the proposed schemes did not comply with the board's finance scheme guidelines.

         On 3 April 1995, at a meeting of the tax concession committee to discuss the above matter, it was indicated that the tax concession committee was aware that the guidelines had been gazetted but not tabled. Further discussion ensued, and the tax concession committee advised that it and the board could be in breach of the Acts Interpretation Act and the IR&amp;D Act. The next day serious concerns about the tax concession committee and the board were expressed. In the culture of silence which seemed to pervade the branch, the fact that the guidelines had not been tabled was common knowledge through the branch but was not discussed, and the integrity of the finance scheme was questioned.

The finance scheme guidelines, adequate Australian content guidelines, register of commercial government bodies guidelines and registered research agencies criteria were endorsed by the board on 12 April 1994.

        At the outset, it is worth stating the obvious, even if it is somewhat tautological: the power given to the Governor-General, ministers or officials to make legislative and quasi-legislative instruments is a power to make law, otherwise exercisable by the Parliament, but here delegated to those subordinates by means of an Act of the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Seen in this light, the power assumes its proper, ie large and significant, proportions. It is because these delegated powers are so important that for many decades, the Parliament, through the Acts Interpretation Act, has imposed a series of requirements designed to circumscribe the power it has delegated to ensure that the laws made under its authority are promptly published, are not retrospective, are reasonably promptly tabled in each House of the Parliament, are disallowable, cannot be repealed and/or remade while a notice of motion of disallowance subsists and if disallowed, cannot be remade within 6 months without parliamentary permission.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The tabling requirement is fundamental. Without tabling, there can be no power of disallowance. Without a power of disallowance, Parliament has no control over its "own" delegates and legislative instruments. The power which Parliament delegates to its agents to exercise on its behalf, becomes a power of its agents to exercise unaccountability, as they choose. The delegated legislative power then becomes, to some extent, equivalent to a discretionary or prerogative power. Instead of the parliamentary accountability procedures being an integral part of the power to make delegated legislative instruments, the power enlarges in the mind of the delegates to be a power in its own right.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Recognition of the constitutional theory behind delegated legislation, and detailed appreciation of the parliamentary control process which is an integral part of the very power itself, is a first requirement of any delegated law-maker. Compliance with these control procedures of tabling and so on, are not mere minutiae of administration to be delegated to the lowest level and forgotten about. They are inherent in the delegated power itself and, legally, the powers evaporate without such compliance.

        Failures to table do occur. However, when they occur on such a scale and to such a degree as is revealed in the case of the Industry, Research and Development Board, it suggests the possibility that there has been a systemic failure of administration at the very highest levels: a failure at the highest levels, not the lowest, properly to understand the nature, limits and conditions of the powers which Parliament has chosen to confer on the Board (and through it, the portfolio). Such understanding should surely have been the first, not the last requirement and concern of the delegates.

        As a rule, where officials consider that, like the government of the day, they are in opposition to, or in incommoded by, parliamentary values, standards and processes, and where they assume a right to the enactment of laws and the unencumbered conferral of legislative powers, there can be little prospect that such systemic failures of administration will not occur again.

        That is a very clear statement of the full significance of the failure to table in this regard. It relates to a failure of an understanding of basic democratic principles at the highest levels of the administration in the portfolio. Ultimately, it is the minister's responsibility to ensure that these principles and values of parliamentary government are understood and conveyed to all officials in the clearest possible terms.

         It is greatly disturbing to those people who value these principles of democratic government that the minister saw fit in the Senate to refer to this matter as an `administrative glitch'. I am afraid that the use of that phrase reflects the fact that there is not on the other side of this parliament a proper respect for, or even an adequate understanding of, the institutions of government in this country. We know that the Labor Party has been very weak in its understanding and respect for the institutions of parliamentary government. We have seen that in the continual contempt with which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) treats this House. Unfortunately, that attitude flows from the very top through the ministry to the senior levels of the administration. So long as officials are under the impression that their superiors—the ministers, representatives of the people, who do not regard these matters as of great importance—we cannot have any assurance that the systemic failure which is evident in this case will not be repeated at future times.

         In 1994-95, some 2,087 disallowable instruments of delegated legislation were made, some 70 per cent by officials. The question must be asked: how many of the disallowable instruments in use by the Commonwealth are valid? How many have been properly gazetted and tabled? No doubt lights have been burning late into the night as these instruments are checked and rechecked. The integrity of this parliament should be of the highest value. So that all members have access to the advice from the clerk assistant of the Senate, I seek leave to table the letter to me.

        This government amendment explicitly identifies the government's intention in relation to consultation with state and local governments on the formulation of national principles and its preparedness to subject these principles to scrutiny. It is designed specifically to address the concern that was expressed by local governments. We wish to allay those concerns. We see ourselves in this role as a responsible and representative government, and we take very seriously our partnership with local government.

         We therefore propose to amend the bill through the introduction of two new subclauses. These subclauses provide for, firstly, the formulation of national principles by way of a disallowable instrument and, secondly, in the case of the national principles to apply for 1996-97 being disallowed, the elements in clauses 6(2) and 6(3) for which the minister must have regard when formulating national principles will continue to apply. This amendment is minor. Despite the significance of the issues it addresses, it does not in any way alter the intentions or purpose of the bill.

        This bill is the central element of a new national competition policy. It will establish processes and institutions to encourage competition, not just in particular sectors, but across the whole economy. This bill and the associated agreements between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments have the potential to trigger reform initiatives for many years to come. Implementing this policy is the most important single development in micro-economic reform in recent years. Ultimately, the ability of the economy to grow and provide jobs and an improved standard of living depends upon how well the productive potential of the economy is employed and enhanced.

         As the federal government set out clearly in its white paper on growth and employment, creating the conditions for new job growth is its principal task. The pay-off from this bill for ordinary Australians is very real. It paves the way for cheaper prices, more growth and more jobs. It is an important element of our ambition to reduce unemployment to around five per cent by the end of this decade.

         The origins of the bill may be traced to 1991 when the Commonwealth and the states and territories agreed to examine a national approach to competition policy. In 1992, the government commissioned the national competition policy review, chaired by Professor Fred Hilmer. The Hilmer report was completed in August 1993. Since then the government has been engaged in extensive consultations with state and territory governments on implementation of the report. The report was discussed by the Council of Australian Governments in February 1994 and August 1994. This culminated in the historic Council of Australian Governments meeting of 11 April 1995, at which the Commonwealth, state and territory governments agreed to implement the new national competition policy.

         The vision of the Hilmer report was for a national competition policy in which the Commonwealth, states and territories cooperated to ensure that universal and uniformly applied rules of market conduct apply to all market participants regardless of their form of ownership. The Commonwealth has worked hard to realise this vision with the cooperation of the states and territories.

         Australian business is increasingly operating on a nationally integrated basis, and a more national approach is needed for business regulation. Businesses and consumers will benefit from the uniform protection of consumer and business rights that a national competition policy will provide. The full measure of these benefits can only be achieved with all governments working together to provide consistent and certain competition rules.

         This bill has been prepared with the benefit of wide ranging consultation with the public since 1992. The Hilmer committee received more than 130 public submissions. In preparing draft legislation in response to the Hilmer report, officers of Commonwealth, state and territory governments, met with a range of business, consumer, union and environmental representatives. A package containing a draft of this bill and draft inter-governmental agreements was released in September 1994 for public comment. The package attracted more than 60 substantive submissions from the public. The broad thrust of the package met with general community approval.

         The main elements of the bill take the form of amendments to the Trade Practices Act and the Prices Surveillance Act. The Trade Practices Act will be amended so that, with state and territory application legislation, the prohibitions against anti-competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia. A new legal regime will be created which facilitates businesses obtaining access to the services of certain essential infrastructure facilities. The Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority will be merged to form the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and a new advisory body, the National Competition Council, will be established. Prices surveillance processes will be streamlined, and their jurisdiction extended to state and territory government businesses.

         In particular the agreement, and indeed the package of reforms in total, does not compel, or even encourage, governments to privatise government business enterprises, nor to abandon or reduce community service obligations. The package, as with the report by the Hilmer committee, is silent on the issue of public versus private ownership. The agreement sets out certain processes that should be followed where a government business enterprise is to be privatised or exposed to competition for the first time. The decision as to whether, and when, a government business enterprise might be privatised remains the exclusive responsibility of the owning government.

         Taken together, the bill and the three inter-governmental agreements represent a complete response to the recommendations of the Hilmer committee. In many respects the package is simply a statement of commonsense. It is not a radical notion that businesses should not be permitted to engage in anti-competitive conduct. It is not a radical notion that consumers generally benefit from greater competition and that, where possible, greater competition should be encouraged. It is not a radical notion that, in reviewing legislation or market structures, due consideration should be given to opportunities to enhance efficiency through competition. But the great step forward made by this package is that it sets out these statements of commonsense for all to see; it creates new institutions better able to encourage businesses and governments to act in accordance with these statements of commonsense; and the resulting principles will be applied to all Australian businesses regardless of ownership or legal form.

         There has been some concern that implementing a national competition policy will lead to the wholesale dismantling of the public sector. This is a serious misunderstanding of the proposed reforms. For the most part, these reforms are relevant only after governments have taken the threshold policy decision to introduce competition, and then only to `significant' business activities. Many public sector organisations have both commercial and non-commercial functions, and these reforms are not designed to affect the non-commercial functions undertaken for governments.

Similarly, these reforms will not be relevant to public hospitals treating public patients or providing in-house hospital services, but may be relevant where those hospitals are treating private patients or operating commercial cleaning services. In these areas a public hospital would be directly competing with private firms.

There will only be one enforcement agency, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and all enforcement action will be brought in the Federal Court.

         Presently, the Commonwealth, the states and territories can legislate or make regulations which provide for exemptions from the competitive conduct rules of the Trade Practices Act.

         The bill inserts a new part into the Trade Practices Act, to establish a legal regime to facilitate third parties obtaining access to the services of certain essential facilities of national significance. The notion underlying the regime is that access to certain facilities with natural monopoly characteristics, such as electricity grids or gas pipelines, is needed to encourage competition in related markets, such as electricity generation or gas production. Access to such facilities can be achieved if a person seeking access is successful in having the service `declared' and then negotiates access with the service provider.

This provides a means by which an owner or operator can obtain certainty about access arrangements, before a third party seeks access.

The new integrated and complete approach to national competition policy, which balances economic efficiency and broader elements of the public interest, will give Australia one of the most sophisticated competition policies in the world. It will help to dismantle private and regulatory barriers to competition, and to promote competition across the economy. It will provide the domestic policy arrangements we need to realise the opportunities arising from our external trade policies and the dynamic developments in the international economy. The reward will be an economy that provides more opportunities to satisfy the aspirations of all Australians.

        The Senate has amended this bill to remove the provisions on sales tax refunds. This provision was attempting to ensure that sales tax payers seeking refunds of tax are required to use the provisions provided in the sales tax legislation for that purpose. The provisions in the sales tax legislation have two main requirements for refunds to be paid. The first is that the taxpayer—that is, the wholesaler—must pass the benefit on to the retailer. The second is that refunds can only be claimed back three years. That is the same requirement as is placed on the commissioner.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         These are reasonable requirements. They simply try to avoid situations where a wholesaler gets a payout from the public purse—that is, from taxpayers generally—with no requirement to pass this benefit on even though the original tax payments were passed on in the prices charged by the wholesaler. The Senate amendment will allow wholesalers to make common law challenges seeking sales tax refunds even though they have not ultimately borne the tax.

         This is an appalling situation and surely contrary to what any reasonable person would consider is an appropriate use of taxpayers' money. Potentially up to a couple of hundred million dollars are at stake here—money that could go as a free kick to large wholesalers who simply have not borne the burden of the tax in the first place. The government will very reluctantly accept the Senate's amendment at this stage, but will consider its position and consider bringing this measure back next session in the hope that wiser heads prevail.

It is estimated that the Senate amendment to increase the threshold for small company tax payers from $8,000 to $10,000 would cost revenue up to $20 million in 1995-96.

         —I note the remarks of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in relation to two of these matters; namely, the proposed change in company thresholds and also the claims for sales tax refund and the common law claims that may be made under that. I also note that the government will not at this stage be pressing those matters. I will not say anything in relation to that matter.

         I noted that Senator Cook indicated in the Senate that the matter of company thresholds—namely, the improving of tax treatment of small business—had been referred to the Senate Economics References Committee for inquiry and that the government is committed to responding to that report. In those circumstances, as the Assistant Treasurer indicated, we will look forward to the government's response to that report.

         These amendments also relate to the proposed change in provisional tax treatment. This legislation proposes that the provisional tax rate be set at eight per cent. We have sought previously, both in this place and elsewhere, to have the provisional tax uplift factor set at six per cent rather than eight per cent, and have moved amendments to do that. In doing so we were acting on our commitment to small business and to self-funded retirees. About 800,000 small businesses and investors pay provisional tax in Australia and they, of course, are the ones who are most hit by this budget measure.

         The coalition believes that the uplift factor should be set at a realistic level which is more consistent with expected rates of income growth and inflation. For example, headline inflation for the year to March was 3.9 per cent. Why then does the government assume, through this legislation, that an average income for a provisional tax payer will rise by eight per cent? That is more than double what the headline rate of inflation was until March of this year.

         The government has refused to nominate factors—other than the inflation rate—which have been taken into account in setting this uplift rate at eight per cent. At the end of the day, taxpayers pay taxes assessed on assessable income. If provisional tax payers' incomes do not rise by eight per cent, they can apply for a variation. This is an additional administrative burden and carries with it some risk.

         If the provisional tax payers' estimate is not within 15 per cent of the amount, they can be liable for additional tax. Alternatively, they can pay it and claim a credit when they file their end of year taxation return. But in claiming a credit when the tax return is filed gives the tax office the benefit of having the tax in the meantime. The tax paid eventually is evened out, but the cash flow advantage under this flows to the tax office while the cash flow penalty goes to the taxpayer.

         If we look at the submissions that were made on this when the matter came before the Senate Economics Reference Committee, we see that many groups gave compelling evidence for the uplift factor to be examined and reduced. The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants gave evidence that it is hard for its members and advisers to tell small businesses that the rationale behind an eight per cent increase is an assumption of an eight per cent increase in their income. Everybody would be happy with an eight per cent increase in their income, but the fact is that most do not find and will not find this to be a reality. The society gave evidence that if there is an uplift factor it should be in the order of the current level of inflation. As I indicated earlier, the headline rate of inflation was 3.9 per cent to the March quarter.

         The Taxation Institute of Australia gave evidence to the same effect. The Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation of Australia said that the low inflationary environment of recent times and the determination of the monetary authorities to maintain inflation below three per cent has made a mockery of the federal government's refusal to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor. We say to the Assistant Treasurer and to the government: if you were being realistic and not simply greedy about the amount of revenue which you can bring in—if only for a period during the tax year—and if you were basing the uplift tax factor on the real rates of inflation out there in the community, you would not be basing it at eight per cent as you propose in this legislation but would have it closer to the inflation rate of 3.9 per cent to March.

         We have moved amendments to bring the provisional tax uplift factor back to six per cent, which is a much more realistic level—and even that allows for some area of flexibility. We regard the government's proposed eight per cent as being greedy. It is simply ripping off small business and making it increasingly difficult for small business in this country. It is ripping off those who rely upon their own self-funded investments to maintain their retirement incomes and is unwarranted on the basis of the underlying economic circumstances of this country.

         Because of the way in which this particular measure has been drafted, the reality is that, if we do not support it here, it will go back to 10 per cent. Ten per cent is obviously worse than eight per cent. We would certainly support eight per cent rather than the current 10 per cent. If the government were being realistic and not greedy it would set the provisional tax rate uplift factor at six per cent, which is a realistic level. If it is concerned about small business and the people living off their own retirement incomes, then it would not be ripping them off an extra two per cent under these provisional uplift factors. We say, again, that the provisional tax rate uplift factor ought to be six per cent but, because of the way in which the measure has been drafted, eight per cent is better than 10 per cent. We will therefore support eight per cent—but reluctantly, because we believe it ought to be lower.

        On this, the last day of the financial year, 30 June 1995, Australia has posted its worst deficit in Australian history. The deficit for the month of May, which was released at 11.30 this morning, was $2,900 million for one month—$2,900 million of deficit for one month. If we disaggregate those figures, Australia in the month of May, it has been announced at 11.30 this morning, went backwards in its deficit at $94 million a day, or $4 million an hour.

         The recent OECD forecasts—and these ought to be etched into the minds of every Australian—show that Australia now has a current account worse than Mexico. The problem is not just that we came last, but that we came last by such a long shot. Australia's forecast current account deficit of six per cent in 1995 was the highest in the OECD, and the second highest was 2.7 per cent—less than half that of ours. We had a deficit of six per cent of GDP, compared with Mexico's 1.5 per cent. Our current account deficit was four times worse than Mexico's. Let me make this point: Mexico's current account last year was worse than ours. Last year, we were forecast to have a current account deficit of 4.6 per cent, while Mexico was forecast to have a current account deficit of 7.8 per cent.

         What happened? What made that turnaround in Mexico? The answer is that it was the warning that was indelibly etched into the OECD report. It warned that negative or adverse investor sentiment can change things. What happened in Mexico at the end of 1994 is that investor sentiment turned against that country. When investor sentiment turned against Mexico, its currency collapsed. Its interest rates went to 50 per cent. It went into a severe recession and it fixed its current account problem, but at what cost? It was a 50 per cent interest rate, a severe recession and a bailout package from the United States. Do we want to see that happen in Australia? Of course we do not.

If others fix it for you, the pain that is inflicted on your own citizens is enormous and horrendous.' What does the government say in light of this? `Yes. We will fix it'? `Yes. We are in the parliament acknowledging our mistakes'? `Yes. We don't want to run the risk of losing that sentiment amongst international investors'? No. We hear nothing—not a word of explanation, not an appearance in the parliament, not a turning of policy and not an apology to the Australian people.

         Government members show all the hallmarks of a group of people who have been closeted in their ministerial offices, closeted in their ministerial cars and closeted away from the people of Australia; as a result, they have lost all sight of why they are here. They have lost all sight of building for the future. They have lost all interest in anybody but themselves. The attitude of government members is, `As long as we are on those benches and in our ministerial cars, who cares?' That is what you are saying—`Who cares?' As long as you get the opportunity to aggrandise yourselves with titles such as `parliamentary secretary' or `minister', you are happy—that is all you want.

         The Australian people are asking for much more. The Australian people are asking for a government that cares; the Australian people are asking for a government that is concerned about the future. The Australian people are asking how it is that after twelve years of government we are in our third fully-fledged current account deficit? How is it that things are now worse than they were when the Prime Minister was warning about the banana republic? The reality is that things are worse than when the Prime Minister was warning about the banana republic. Will he go on the John Laws program and renew his warning?

I suppose it is our fault for being in opposition, because if we had been in government it would not have occurred, but if you want to make the argument on any other basis whatsoever, it is supposed to be all our fault.

         Here he is, the Prime Minister. He has his hands on all of the levers, there has been a seizure in the machine, and who is at fault? It is the guys who have been over there watching. It has nothing to do with his maintaining the machine or greasing the oils or pulling the levers. He says, `Do not ask me who is responsible. It is all the opposition's fault.' The latest argument is that because the opposition has defeated $215 million of new taxes in relation to building materials—$215 million to be collected over twelve months, 365 days—it is all our fault.

         Before I was so rudely interrupted, I was talking about what the Labor government has done for telecommunications and for Australia Post. I talked about where the government is going with competition policy and how competition policy is concerned with all facets of government policy. The most important aspect of this bill is the national approach that the government has taken. That is shown in the increasing integration of economic activity across all states and territories.

         The importance of internal borders has continued to decrease. The importance of international borders has also diminished as tariffs and other barriers to free trade with other countries have been dropped through the forums that the government has created, such as APEC. National competition policy provides a framework of laws, principles and processes, as well as two key institutions—the National Competition Council and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.

         The bill before the House—which the coalition refuses to debate because it has no concept of what it is about—has, in the 18 months since that Hilmer report was released and in the 10 months since the draft legislation was made available for comment, been the subject of extensive consultation. The government has had extensive discussions with various concerned groups.

         I will address the concerns of a number of those groups. The state governments fear a loss of revenue from areas where they have been monopoly service providers. The ACTU is concerned about the loss of jobs and conditions and the reduction in the role of the public sector, which was of prime concern to it, and the public sector's ability to continue to meet community service obligations once it is subject to competitive pressures. Related concerns are about such public interest issues as whether the environment and equity will be ignored in the new competitive marketplace if efficiency is narrowed to economic items.

         I believe that the government has addressed all the concerns about the bill which is now before the House. At the COAG meeting in April 1995, the states and territories reached agreement with the Commonwealth on all outstanding issues. The Industry Commission report found that the states and territories will not lose revenue when competition is introduced. In fact, it estimated that the states and territories will have a windfall gain of some $3 billion. That is an addition, because the Commonwealth will also experience those gains. The states and territories have until June 1996 to provide a detailed program so that they can share the pool of money that will be available to them.

         On the ACTU's concern about potential loss of conditions and jobs if government enterprises are opened up to competition, it needs to be recognised that, through productivity bargaining over the last 10 years, the government has been instrumental in downsizing some areas of the public sector. There has also been increased efficiency within the public sector. There is no reason to expect major job losses in areas where efficiencies have already been made.

         The federal government recognises that while micro-economic reform benefits the society as a whole the adjustment costs may fall disproportionately on some groups of workers. That is why we have developed our white paper initiatives, such as our labour market programs, including training and retraining, to assist those few who may be adversely affected.

         The wages and the conditions of our workers in areas opened up to competition through corporatisation or even privatisation are already protected, and they are protected through transmission of business provisions in section 149 of the Industrial Relations Act, which the honourable member for Higgins wanted to decry in this parliament. If there is any doubt about transmission, the government can take other steps, such as including provisions to protect our workers in the sale contracts. In the case of corporatisation, there is a charge on the employer, so existing awards and agreements continue to apply. The government does not see this exercise as a way to reduce wages and conditions but as a way to achieve an economy based on high productivity and high wages.

         We have only a limited time on the bill. There is so much more I would like to say. It is one of the finest pieces of legislation ever introduced in this House. It has taken a lot of consultation. I commend the minister on introducing the bill, a bill that needs to be adequately debated, not treated with disrespect by the coalition, which has abused its role as a so-called alternative government. I commend this bill to the House.

In the Industrial Relations Reform Act, the government transferred sections 45D and 45E to the Industrial Relations Act. The legislation also removed the $250,000 penalty applying for a breach of the Trade Practices Act.

         Sections 45D and 45E were important restrictions on anti-competitive conduct. They prohibited the interruption of the supply of goods and services by secondary boycotts and prohibited arrangements preventing the supply of goods or services to a corporation. By weakening the secondary boycott provisions, the current law was designed to grant trade unions privileges under the law, that is, the privilege to engage in anti-competitive conduct.

         The reality is that the Hilmer report actually recommended the retention of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. We have a government that tells the people of Australia that through this legislation it is implementing the recommendations of the Hilmer report, but it is implementing it only up to a point. When it comes to dealing with sections 45D and 45E, which the Hilmer report itself recommended the implementation of, the government says it cannot go that far; it has to protect its own vested interests; it cannot implement the Hilmer recommendations across the board.

         The Labor Party has gutted the notion of equality before the law for trade unions. In its 1992 amendments to the Trade Practices Act it protected trade unions with a special rate on penalties 40 times lower than that which applies to corporations. The Industrial Relations Reform Act of 1993 effectively scrapped penalties for trade unions all together. The Hilmer committee provided an independent assessment of competition policy and did not distinguish nor discriminate between the anti-competitive actions of trade unions and those of corporations. This is what the report said:

        Those are the words of Professor Hilmer and the Hilmer report. He said that competition is a good thing for this country and we ought to have more of it. The government is saying competition is a good thing for this country as long as it does not have any effect on any of those vested interests that it represents in this place, namely, the trade unions. The opposition says that if we are going to have competition policy let us apply it across the board and apply it to trade unions just as you do to corporations, and that is the effect of the amendments which have been moved. I ask leave of the House to move these amendments together.

         —In response to what the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) had to say about Hilmer's views on sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act, Hilmer did not say anything of the kind; in fact, he was silent on 45D and 45E. As far as his assertion that somehow we should have adopted the Hilmer report holus bolus, that is, make no changes, of course the government was never going to be in that position. Wide consultation with the community led to significant changes to the legislation which improved it.

         Listening to the responses after we had released the draft legislation and the inter-governmental agreements led to significant changes which streamlined the operation of the legislation but also gave it a much wider focus because, as I said in my second reading speech, we are not introducing competition for competition's sake; we are introducing competition where it is for the public benefit.

         The public benefit test is enshrined in the foreword to the legislation and also in the inter-governmental agreements. There is a wide area that has to be covered when this legislation and the principals that governments have signed up to actually introduce competition. We did not introduce the Hilmer report as it was presented to us, but it did form the basis of the final outcome and of the Competition Policy Reform Bill, which is before the House today.

         Another area where we did not agree with the outcome of the report was that the prime focus on competition should be on economic efficiency. We stayed with the public interest test. Another area where we deviated from the report was in pricing. If you read the Hilmer report and you have a look at the final outcome of this bill and the inter-governmental agreements that go with it, you will find that the government has moved a long way from the rather limited recommendations that were contained in the Hilmer report to the government.

         So it is absolutely wrong to think that, just because a report to a government favours certain things, the government should automatically adopt those things. They are just recommendations to the government. The opposition is always running around the country talking about sections 45D and 45E and labour market reform, as though this is part of the Hilmer package. It never was. It was not in the terms of reference, and the report that we received never referred to it because it was not in the terms of reference, and neither should it have been. It is an entirely different agenda.

         The other thing I would say about this package, and I stress this as often as I can, is that it is not about privatisation; this whole package is about competition. If you were to sell tomorrow any public monopoly in Australia so that it became a private monopoly, you have not increased competition. You have still got the one operator, a new one, but you would not have any more competition. So we have got in place procedures where governments choose to go down that path.

If we have commissioners who are doing a good job, who have the expertise, why would you not leave them there? Why would you take that option out? Obviously, if they are not performing, or if there are different needs, or if you need to put somebody in there with a different view about competition policy, you are free to do it. It does not mean to say you have to keep them there, but we do not close off the option.

         If I had thought that was a remarkable achievement, my hopes achieved Himalayan levels two nights ago, when I received a tentative indication from the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) that not only would it be debated, but that the government might agree to it—albeit with one or two amendments. But I am sorry to tell the long-suffering people of the member for Lowe's electorate—those people who live in Haberfield, Five Dock and Drummoyne who, along with my constituents in suburbs like Hunters Hill and North Ryde, have been shamefully penalised by this government as a result of its punitive, discriminatory, anti-residential aircraft noise policies—that it looks as though the government is now going to bury my private member's bill.

         The member for Lowe may shake her head, but she knows and I know that she knows, that there is a great deal of confusion in the ranks of the government on this issue. The original idea was that the government was going to support the bill, subject to the amendment moved or suggested by the member for Lowe. That is how the media was briefed a couple of nights ago; but apparently there was an argument between the member for Lowe and the Minister for Transport and member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton).

         It is most instructive that the Minister for Transport is not going to participate in this debate. Laurie Brereton is the author of the punishment of the people of Haberfield, Drummoyne and Five Dock. Those people who live in those suburbs in the member for Lowe's electorate have one man, and one man alone, to blame for the penalty that they are now suffering. Since the opening of the third runway, noise has increased over their homes and has dramatically affected their enjoyment of life. Those people know—as does the member for Lowe—that the man who, more than anybody else, is responsible for that increased aircraft noise is the Minister for Transport.

She can shake her head but that really does not alter the fact that two nights ago she wanted to agree with me and put this bill through this week.

         —Senator Collins supports it, and he represents the Northern Territory. He is showing more concern for the people who live in Haberfield, Five Dock and Drummoyne than is the member for Lowe. When the three mayors—two of whom would never vote for me in a fit, I imagine—came to see me the other day, they at least got a courteous hearing. They waited around for hours to see the Minister for Transport and then they were told he was too busy; he was not available. He was probably conjuring up some other transport or industrial relations disaster to inflict upon the people of Australia.

         If the parliamentary processes of this country mean anything, they afford two people—whether they are leaders of the opposition, ministers or private members—the right, when there is an issue that specifically and uniquely affects their electorates, to move a private member's bill. This issue is of particular concern to a small number of people, but most of that small number of people live in either my electorate or the two adjoining electorates. Therefore, I have a special obligation to try to do something about the problem. I have a special obligation to stand up for them. I have discharged that obligation. I have invited the parliament to pass a law that will give these people immediate relief. If the Labor Party were prepared to support my proposal, then that relief could be provided by the parliament passing that law this afternoon.

         —I  wish to speak on the Sydney Airport Curfew (Air Navigation) Amendment Bill 1995. This bill does not make any effort to ease the burden of the airport's operations at night for the residents of Sydney. The proposal to place the Sydney airport curfew into an act of parliament will change nothing with respect to the curfew at the airport. The curfew for Sydney airport is already established in legislation under the air navigation aerodrome curfew regulations made pursuant to the Air Navigation Act 1920.

         This proposal does no more than maintain the current provisions of the act. The bill proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) just does not go far enough. All of his gesturing here today still comes to nought because it is simply not a strong enough bill. What I am doing on behalf of my constituents is attempting to strengthen that bill and to improve the situation for the people of my electorate and other electorates, including the honourable member for Bennelong's electorate, that are affected by the airport's operations. Placing the current curfew arrangements in the act, rather than as regulations as at present, could make it more difficult to tighten the curfew arrangements as it would require the approval of both houses of parliament.

         While I support the strengthening of the curfew, this proposed current legislation is inadequate on several counts. It would entrench a current situation of quotas in the shoulder periods. Currently, 56 movements are allowed under this quota system, disturbing the sleeping hours of my constituents and others affected by airport noise. Secondly, there should be full consultation. The member for Bennelong in his first reading speech on Monday, 26 June said that his bill would require the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to consult widely before any attempts were made to alter the curfew. I am simply recommending public consultation about the entrenching of this quota system into law.

To come into this House in the last week of sittings and introduce this bill, knowing full well that it would not come up for debate until the next sittings, is grandstanding in the extreme.

         The only reason that we are debating this issue today is that the government, at my urging, realises that the public cannot and should not be taken for granted and that they have the right to express their views about this issue. Although I agree with the principle of the member for Bennelong's bill with regard to public consultation, the section on consultation in his bill is poorly drafted. The parliamentary counsel should redraft it and a shorter time should be given for this consultation.

         On reflecting on this proposed legislation, one realises it also has other shortcomings—that is why I am not moving an amendment—namely, that the penalty provisions are inadequate. Under regulation, the maximum penalty for an individual breakage of the curfew is $5,000. For an airline, a corporation, it is $25,000. This is obviously not enough. If an airline is faced with the decision of either paying for overnight hotel accommodation for its people or breaking the curfew, at this rate it will be more inclined to break the curfew. We must toughen up these penalties and much more legislation is required to set them. They cannot be set under regulation. This must be addressed.

         Earlier this week I made the press, the public and my party aware of my intention to move an amendment to this bill. The amendment would have taken the form of recommending that the issues of the shoulder period, with the possibility of a sunset quota, and the minimisation of current quotas be examined by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure with a view to its being able to tighten the curfew provisions.

All of this posturing today does not relate to the fact that he knows there are many situations in which the shoulder period of the curfew is being abused. He is not prepared to do anything about it with his current legislation. It is a mockery to say that this legislation would be introduced and be passed in the Senate today. He knows full well that this is the case.

Whilst I appreciate the importance of tourism to this country, you cannot keep asking the same people to keep enduring such excessive amounts of pain.

During our hearings we took evidence from the New South Wales government—this was, of course, the previous Liberal government—and other representatives. They made it clear that in their opinion KSA should be curfew free for the Olympics. When I suggested that, if the curfew were lifted for the Olympics it might continue and be thrown out altogether, they agreed. I informed them that my electorate was Lowe and suggested that this would be achieved over my dead body.

         This stands in stark contrast to the Liberals. Recent action was taken by the government, at the urging of me and other government members of this House, to tighten up the curfew arrangements at Sydney airport. These include the elimination on 19 April 1995 of the previous quotas which enabled larger, noisier freight jet aircraft—such as the B737, the A300 and the DC9—during curfew hours; the promulgation on 19 April 1995 of the sunset provisions in the regulations, triggered by the opening of Sydney West airport, which transfer all curfew freight movements from Sydney airport to Sydney West airport; the provision on 22 December 1994 of fines of up to $25,000 for each case of a breach of the curfew; severe restrictions since November 1994 on the ability of the aviation industry to obtain dispensation from the provisions of the curfew; and daily monitoring of, and reporting on, curfew operations, with all detail of operations, flight paths and breaches provided to the Sydney airport community consultative committee chaired by the Hon. Joe Riordan and including community and local government representatives, including me, from areas affected by the airport's operations.

         Many constituents of mine have contacted me about the privatisation of Kingsford Smith and Sydney West airports. They are concerned that in any leasing arrangements the curfew will be an issue which is non-negotiable should the airports be in private rather than public hands. The action we are taking here today, by referring this legislation to the Standing Committee on Transport, Communication and Infrastructure, with a defined report back date, which is 31 August, is a strong stand. There should be legislation entrenching the curfew.

Why was it no longer an issue? Because no state seats changed hands. On that spurious argument alone he came into this House and arrogantly told the people of Australia, particularly those of Sydney, that no changes would be made; the decisions had been made and that was where it would stand.

         The two issues raised so well by the member for Bennelong in his private member's bill are quite simple. The first is to change the curfew arrangements and entrench them in law so that between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. the airport may be used, but outside that time it may not be used, so that these hundreds of thousands of Australian people and their children at least have a prospect of a few hours of peace and quiet to get some sleep.

         The second most important part of his proposal before the House is that the east-west runway should once again be open for normal usage. The significant fact is that the cross-runway was open yesterday for United Airlines flight 815. That runway is also used on occasions when wind circumstances are such that it is no longer possible to use the normal north-south route.

         As a result of this government's policy, the decision was made to not use the east-west runway. The effect of that, as has been so eloquently said by the member for Bennelong, is as follows. Whereas previously the overall noise effect around the KSA perimeter was reasonably fairly shared among the people of the suburbs in that area, that is no longer the case. A substantial proportion—something like 80 per cent—of all the noise now emanating from aircraft landing or taking off from KSA occurs mainly to the north and somewhat to the south. Suburbs to the east and west have almost a pristine environment.

         The politics of that are obvious. To the east and west of KSA all the seats are relatively safe Labor seats. A deal was done to sell out the interests of other parts of the community in the metropolitan area of Sydney to help the members in those particular electorates. It was an outrageous decision because it absolutely ran contrary to that fundamental principle that, while the airport remains—and it is certainly going to for the foreseeable future—and there is a noise problem in the Mascot area, the effects of it should be equitably shared among the people of Sydney.

         Recently in Sydney evidence was requested by the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, and a submission was put forward by Ku-Ring-Gai council on behalf of the residents. The reasons for the scope of the noise impact, as noted in that submission, are quite straightforward. It is primarily because of the closure of the east-west runway, which has resulted in a concentration of fly overs to the north and to the south.

         The flights impacting on the northern suburbs exceed the forecasts because no effective empirical evidence was ever taken to assess precisely what those difficulties would be. The residents of Ku-Ring-Gai concluded that they were never told the truth regarding the potential impact of the operation of the parallel runway system with the utilisation of the new arrangements. Forecasts of the extent and impact of noise have proved to be gravely inaccurate and the criteria used to establish forecasts have now been shown to be totally inadequate, inappropriately applied and based on false premises.

         During the week of 1 to 8 May the council conducted noise monitoring at four locations within the area. It demonstrated conclusively the very significant noise nuisance arising from aircraft. The impact of the noise is also exacerbated by the time at which it occurs, particularly early in the morning at about 6 o'clock. That is when I wake up to hear a 747 going just over my roof. We are told, `Don't worry. They are flying 2,000 feet, or 600 metres, up. There are no problems at all.' We are not talking about areas of Sydney at sea level. We are talking about areas of Sydney at significant altitude, which automatically means that the planes as they approach are much lower than they would be under normal conditions. This has affected not only the lifestyle of people and the health of their families but also property values, which are significantly influenced by features such as peace and quiet. They are the sorts of reasons why people live on the north shore of Sydney.

         The scope of the noise impact associated with the opening of the parallel runway at Kingsford Smith airport was also grossly underestimated.

It is accountable for the fact that thousands of Sydney citizens were deliberately led astray by the CAA and the other authorities. The government must accept the responsibility for that. The effect has been nothing short of devastating on the people close to the airport and on people in areas which were previously regarded as being well outside the influence of the noise.

It has to amend the operational procedures, including controls on slow turns, using increased thrust over residential areas and the speed of descent.

They tend to centre on what is known as the West Pymble beacon, a central point based 10 miles north of the runway.

        In other words, distance was the excuse for doing no worthwhile scientific analysis in the first place—ignoring the fact that aircraft regard distance as of very little significance. When we are talking about distances of 10 miles, or 16 kilometres, it makes the point even clearer.

         Flaws in the foundation criteria deserved examination which they did not receive. The ANEF system, which apparently has been made the sole guideline and determinant to assess the impact on the community, fails to properly account for variations in individual reactions to noise. To intimate that any person outside the ANEF 20 contour will be affected clearly cannot be accepted because it does depend on altitude. It also depends on whether a person is in a valley, because valleys hold in sound which cannot escape.

         As I said earlier, while the presumption is that the flight paths are well above the ground, the truth is that much of Ku-Ring-Gai is a thousand feet above sea level. Indeed, because of the topography of the ground, distance from the noise source is also critical. Had the ANEF calculation taken into account Sydney's topography, clearly the Ku-Ring-Gai area would have fallen within the ANEF 20 zone and, therefore, would have been subject to the analysis which was denied.

         —That has been the opposition's approach to these issues. That is how many bona fides the opposition has on this issue. The government will come back with real proposals, in my view, as a result of the committee report from the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) and take real steps to ensure both strong compliance with the 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and also do more towards the planning of broader air traffic to minimise the impacts on residents of the Sydney region.

         That is really the important test. It is not the grandstanding of the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Bradfield that we have been exposed to today. That sort of grandstanding does not count. The people of Sydney want to know that tangible, long-term steps will be taken to address Sydney airport noise and its impacts. They want to ensure that is done safely. I have not heard anyone in Sydney argue that that should be done in a way that is other than safe.

         Some international work has been done in this regard. Dr Robert Ratner conducted a review of the Australian air traffic services system in 1992. In analysing the impacts of the parallel runways versus the cross-runway in air operations at Sydney, he acknowledged that the airspace structuring principles being used are consistent with the best world practice and `that parallel operations are ultimately the best way of getting high safe movement rates at Sydney airport'. That is the key issue as far as the east-west runway is concerned. The opposition's proposal is designed to jeopardise safe air traffic movement at Sydney airport.

         The other concern of reopening the east-west runway can be quickly spelt out by saying that all that will do is increase the air traffic volume through Sydney airport. In the short term and in the long term, that will be no solution to better air traffic planning and better environmentally sound planning of air traffic movements in the Sydney region. We need to make sure we introduce a comprehensive piece of legislation following the Morris committee report—it will be brought down by the end of August, when the parliament gets back—and as a result of that strong steps are taken to ensure strict conformity to the curfew, to the apron periods. We should ensure that the strongest penalty regime is in place for breach of those curfew arrangements. The way the Leader of the Opposition's bill deals with the penalty regime is as weak as water—absolutely pointless, absolutely hopeless. It is a very weak, poorly drafted piece of legislation. He should go back to square one in that regard.

         What Sydney needs is a stronger level of planning of the broader airport issues in Sydney. I would argue that it is very important that, with the development of Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek, we do not visit upon the residents of western Sydney whom I represent the same sort of short-term planning that has otherwise applied. That is why I would argue very strongly that we need to ensure the strictest environmental arrangements at Sydney West airport.

         The airport issue is very much an integrated process in terms of getting the short-term air traffic movements carried out safely, in an environmentally sound manner and with a minimum of noise. That involves looking at current flight paths to see what further work can be done. It involves getting rid of the older aircraft that at times are a major part of the problem with their increased noise. It involves ensuring strict compliance with both the take-off and landing altitude requirements that the airlines should be following at Sydney airport at the moment. It also means that, when it comes to the development of Badgerys Creek airport, the strongest environmental safeguards are built as part of the study process.

Amendment No. 10, which proposes to insert a new section 2A into the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act, clarifies that AMSA's primary consideration must be its safety regulation and marine environment protection roles, including responsibility for safety of shipping operations along the Australian coastline, maritime safety generally and protection of Australia's marine environment from ships or pollution and other damage.

         On 1 November 1994, Australia entered into a treaty with the United States and Canada which requires each country to ban smoking on all passenger flights operated by its airlines between points in the territory of one party to the treaty and points in the territory of another party, excluding flights operated via an intermediate point in the territory of a state which is not a party to the treaty.

         The second set of amendments to the Air Navigation Act transfer a number of aviation security standards, currently contained in the air navigation regulations, to the act.

         These amendments represent an important component of the government's response to the Monarch Airlines crash. That response, announced by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in October 1994, included increases in passenger carriers' liability limits, as well as the introduction of mandatory insurance.

         The new domestic passenger carriers' liability limit of $500,000 per passenger took effect in October 1994. The government has subsequently introduced legislation to increase the limit for Australia's international carriers to the equivalent amount of 260,000 special drawing rights. Foreign airlines serving Australia have been asked to adopt this higher limit on a voluntary basis.

         Introduction of mandatory insurance is an important complement to the increase in carriers' liability limits. No operator will be allowed to carry passengers for hire or reward without appropriate insurance cover. It will be an offence for an operator to carry passengers without such cover. In the case of domestic carriage, the minimum insurance level is $500,000 per passenger. International carriers, including foreign carriers serving Australia, will be required to provide evidence that they are insured to a level of 260,000 special drawing rights per passenger.

         Importantly, mandatory insurance provisions greatly reduce the scope for insurers to avoid paying compensation in respect of passengers who are killed or injured. For example, insurers will not be able to avoid payment because of a breach of an aviation safety requirement by an operator. These `non-voidability' provisions have been closely modelled on arrangements already applying in the United States of America.

         I turn firstly to the Air Navigation Act 1920. The opposition supports the change to this act. There have been many times in Australia's history when foreign registered aircraft have been used. The most recent example was during the airline dispute of 1989, when we had aeroplanes from a number of countries, including Great Britain, the United States, Austria, Belgium and Yugoslavia, flying Australian skies. There were some worries at that stage about some of the standards of the foreign aircraft. The provisions of this bill will help to cover that situation. There have also been a number of times when leased foreign aircraft have been used in freight services in Australia. I imagine that they will come under this package.

         We also welcome the changes to the security provisions. The importance of having to be ever vigilant regarding aviation safety came to mind in Australia yesterday with the bomb scare on the United Airlines flight from Los Angeles. Nobody would deny that one of the most dreadful aspects of international terrorism is attacks on harmless passengers who are stuck in an aeroplane flying at 35,000 feet. Every provision must be made to provide the best security we possibly can in Australia—not only for international flights but also for internal flights. Unfortunately, in our history we have had—although it was some years ago—an example of a domestic aeroplane being hijacked. A DC9 was hijacked out of Coolangatta. There was a great deal of drama over Brisbane airport regarding that case. Security is a very important aspect of this bill.

         Very briefly, I also make reference to insurance coverage for Australian passengers. Not only does the opposition welcome the insurance coverage provision of this bill but also it would be fair to say that we initiated these changes. We congratulate the government for taking up those changes and at least being able to provide some real compensation for the victims of airline disasters. While not opposing this aspect of the bill, I will pose a couple of questions that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport might like to respond to in his reply.

         I understand that any airline flying into Australia will be required to increase its insurance coverage. We have $500,000 for domestic aircraft and the parliamentary secretary mentioned in his speech the special drawing rights of 260,000, which is roughly the equivalent of $500,000. That is fine, but I understand that it only applies to aircraft flying into Australia. So a foreign airline coming into Australia would be required, under Australian law, to provide extra insurance above the provisions of the Warsaw Convention so that up to $500,000 would be paid to victims of an accident. That is fine.

         The thing that worries me is that I do not believe you necessarily would have any power at all over foreign airlines which were signatories to the Warsaw Convention. My understanding is that, while the foreign airlines would be encouraged to have this extra insurance, it would be very difficult to enforce. If an airline did not have that sort of coverage, the department's response would be that the foreign airline would be required to carry a notice on the ticket to say something to the effect, `You may not necessarily be covered to the full amount of $500,000 while you are flying this airline.' That could be a bit of a deterrent for somebody to not use that airline, and that is fair enough.

         But a number of tickets sold in Australia are printed on the paper of airlines that do not fly here. I rang a travel agent friend of mine to find out what sorts of combinations we have and there are literally dozens of them. Maybe the parliamentary secretary could explain to me one example that he gave me. LOT, the Polish airline, undertakes a great deal of ticket sales in Australia for people who are flying to Poland. It utilises the service of Qantas between Sydney and Singapore before transferring to LOT, the Polish airline. The point is that it is a LOT ticket. We have no problems with the Qantas sector of that ticket, but how are we going to get LOT, the Polish airline, to give coverage for the rest of the way?

         Similarly, what would happen with a multistage ticket? Multistage tickets are not uncommon, especially with business travels around the world. You could well find an Australian flying to Bangkok on Qantas, on Aeroflot to Moscow, on LOT to Warsaw, on some other carrier to the United States—that Australian could also have an internal ticket in the United States, under which he would be covered by US aviation law—and then on Qantas on the way home. I am not quite sure how you are going to cover that situation. Are you going to have funny little stickers on dozens of tickets in your possession saying that you may not be covered to the full amount?

While the intention is right, I do not think it is very likely at the moment. Indeed, the chef out at Kirribilli would probably be spending most of his time making fruit cakes for the Prime Minister to deliver down to Long Bay gaol. But, quite seriously, there are aspects of it that I think are going to be quite difficult for not only airlines but also travel agents to comprehend and to implement.

But, if we are trying to push the world to reach this, why would we go for 260,000 SDRs and the Europeans go for 250,000 SDRs?

So the opposition parties do welcome aspects of the bill. They are not contentious.

If we look at the development of aviation around Australia and the Asia-Pacific region and at the application of the Australian regulations on SDRs, it is really quite incredible.

         At the moment we are looking at something like 50-plus airlines generating new services within China and within the region. There will be an increase in new aircraft sales in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, over the next 10 years or so. We will have a situation where the whole region will be flooded with a lot of new carriers. The expansion of civil aviation around Asia will further complicate the provision of adequate compensation services.

         If aircraft fleet sizes are expanded, the aircraft will have to have somewhere to go. We should be aware of the expansion of aviation infrastructure around Asia.

         I believe there are enormous opportunities for Australia to get into Indonesia and be involved in not only the construction of those new airports but also areas such as aircraft servicing of Indonesian carriers. Indeed, in Indonesia a number of new carriers are emerging and a number of the domestic carriers who are presently operating are expanding their fleets and beginning international services. That is the story right around Asia.

         I think another area that we should be very aware of within which there are opportunities for Australia is the Indian subcontinent. For the first time the Indian government is starting to open up aviation to competition; no longer is it just Indian Airlines and Air India running air services there. There are a number of private companies and joint ventures that are starting on the Indian subcontinent. That new growth also will provide tremendous opportunities for Australians.

         However, while all this goes on, one of our very real difficulties is that we in Australia are not necessarily mirroring the expansion which is occurring in Asia. One of the things I would impress on the government is that we really have to be fully aware of what this particular expansion will do to our own aviation infrastructure over the next 10 to 15 years. When we consider that by the year 2000 we will have something like 120 million Asian people going abroad and running around the area on holidays, and that Australia will want a fair share of that activity, we must be absolutely sure that we have the aviation infrastructure to be able to handle that sort of expansion.

Some specialist groups are coming into Australia, but there is tremendous capacity for us in that particular area to open right up as it can provide literally millions of tourists every year if we want them—but, more importantly, if we have the capacity to handle that business.

         One of the great burdens on the industry over recent years has been the concentration of airlines into fewer and fewer larger operators and the demise of smaller operators.

         We need to look at productivity comparisons. Post World War II the Lockheed Constellations had a flight crew—not a cabin crew—of nine persons and a passenger load of 50 persons. Today, in a 747-400, we have a flight crew of two persons and a passenger capacity of between 400 and 500—depending on the length of the journey. That places a great deal of added responsibility on the technology and on the competence and quality of the crew involved. It also puts a much greater burden on ensuring that there is a high utilisation rate of that very expensive equipment.

         That is why in the management of international airline growth it is important that the pressure for productivity improvement and better protection of passengers continues to grow. At a time when we are looking at the internationalisaton of Qantas, it is appropriate to be looking at the relationship between our own airlines and other international airlines and also to be looking at the technical aspects of the operation of the equipment that we use.

         When we look north to Asia and where the rapid growth routes are within the world, we can see that the pressure will also be on using larger and larger vehicles. In this whole consideration of international aviation it is so easy to get confused and place too much emphasis on numbers of passengers when the critical control is always on the number of aircraft movements. We now see on the drawing boards aircraft being designed having up to 600-passenger capacity and maybe up to 800-passenger capacity. There is very little difference between the time taken to handle—that is, to land and park or to move out and depart—a 140-passenger aircraft and the time taken to handle a 440-passenger aircraft.

Here we see that continuing improvement in the technology that I referred to earlier where the buses get bigger. The number of bus movements do not change very much, but the size of the buses and their passenger carrying capacity get bigger. That is why we are now looking at aircraft having up to 600-passenger capacity. It is not that long ago that major international aircraft had a 50-passenger capacity.

         I turn to another aspect concerning the position of next of kin in the event of the unthinkable occurring. When that happens, we need to ensure that there is adequate protection under the international conventions not only for international passengers but also for domestic passengers. We need protection for domestic passengers not only with the major carriers such as Qantas, Ansett and the major commuter carriers but also with the smaller aircraft in what I call the grey area—the area that we are looking at in our aviation safety inquiry. This grey area includes the commercial charter operators where the standards of requirement for servicing those aircraft are considerably less than if the aircraft were licensed to operate as a regular public transport operator. It is in those aircraft where inevitably the risks are greater and where it has often been the case in the past that there is no insurance protection. Over the years we have had a number of instances where tragedy has struck. Families of victims in air crashes have been impoverished because there has not been insurance cover provided by the operator of the aircraft.

         Many people think that pilots are gods. Pilots are not gods. Pilots are just people who drive a passenger vehicle. When the unthinkable occurs—that is, when a crash occurs—there needs to be adequate insurance protection and financial protection for those who may be affected by it. That is why I am very pleased that this legislation provides that domestic carriers have a liability limit of $500,000 per passenger. That liability was applied in October of last year and is being carried forward. No operator will be allowed to carry passengers for hire or reward without appropriate insurance cover. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) said in his second reading speech, it will be an offence for an operator to carry passengers without that cover.

         The minimum insurance level—not the maximum level—is $500,000 per passenger. That mandatory insurance will ensure that in future people who are affected by an air crash will not be left unprovided for or impoverished because they did not check whether the operator of the aircraft had adequate insurance cover and whether they were adequately protected. At times other countries have had provisions in respect of international carriage operation. In domestic air services in the United States a minimum level of insurance cover is provided, but there is an extensive business in selling additional insurance coverage at airports.

         The route we have followed in Australia is a far better one. Australia has much higher mandatory minimum insurance protection for passengers than the United States has. Although its minimum figure is lower than ours, there is an extensive business in marketing virtually buy your own policies where people put their money in a slot and collect their policy as they board an aircraft. That is how people in America buy additional cover. That is why this legislation—its provisions have applied since last October—is good legislation. Addressing this need has been long overdue. This legislation ensures that air travel, as another form of public transport, provides people with safe services and with adequate financial protection.

         Over recent months the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure has been conducting an aviation safety inquiry. Submission after submission has pointed to the avoidance of regulations. It seems as though this has been drawn from the commercial environment of the small industry of general aviation and charter aircraft. It is a small industry which very much has old aircraft, is oversupplied, has too little business, has rates of return which are too low and has continuing commercial pressure being placed upon a range of operators to cut corners. At the same time that overall situation seems to me to be exacerbated by an oversupply of pilots.

         There are a number of similarities between aviation safety and ship safety. Whether people are travelling on ships or in aircraft, the ultimate responsibility and the last line of protection for them rests with the person in command of the vehicle. On a ship, it is the captain. On an aircraft, it is the pilot in command. The pilot in command is the last line of defence for intending passengers. He has to ensure the aircraft is airworthy, it has been properly checked before flight, it carries sufficient fuel for the flight that is to be undertaken, the weather conditions lend themselves to the operation of that flight, the crew on the aircraft have the required level of competence and the aircraft has been properly maintained in accordance with Civil Aviation Authority regulations, or Civil Aviation Safety Authority regulations as of tomorrow.

         When you have a sector of the industry whose last line of defence is severely weakened by an oversupply of pilots, it becomes very difficult in some circumstances for the pilot to carry out his or her responsibilities.

If you don't value your job, there are 3,000 other pilots outside the gate.' We were given that evidence in Moorabbin during our inquiry.

What decisions ought we be looking at? What conclusions ought we be reaching?

As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), has said, there is some emphasis on the fact that part of the bill deals with the proper insurance of aircraft. That matter has received a lot of attention over recent times as there have been several tragic accidents.

I pointed out that Mr Dick Smith, the former chair of the CAA, made a scurrilous attack on Mr Ian Macphee, who chaired the inquiry that looked into the letting of the TAAATS contract. As chairman of the Public Works Committee, I was very involved in the inquiry leading up to the letting of the contract. I know that successive ministers have had real concerns about air safety in Australia.

A lot of allegations about collusion in tendering and so on were being flung around at the time. I received all sorts of telephone calls and heard all sorts of accusations in this regard. I recommended to this parliament that an inquiry be set up to look into the matter because my committee was very concerned about safety of air travel in Australia. We wanted Australia to have the best possible safety standards.

         Ian Macphee came to that inquiry with a very open mind. I thought he brought down an excellent report which canvassed all the issues.

We should bear in mind that it was Dick Smith, when he was chair of the CAA, who wanted to give us safety at an affordable price. There is no such thing as safety at an affordable price. But that was his policy. I am not going to say that some of the things that have happened in relation to aircraft in recent years have resulted because of Dick Smith's period as chairman of that organisation, but I believe that that was a contributing factor.

         One matter which is not mentioned in this bill but which I would like to touch on very briefly is the fact that it is time we looked more seriously at the insurance issues relating to sports aviation. Sports aviation is a growing sport in Australia. It is quite trendy to go up in an ultralight or a gyrocopter. They are accidents waiting to happen. I was involved in the inquiry that looked into sports aviation. A guy who came before the committee, having told me that I had asked the most stupid question he had ever heard, proceeded to give me a lecture. He said, `Right to fly, right to die.' He then said, `What gives politicians the right to say what we can do? If we want to go up and get killed, that is our decision.'

What really annoys me are these people who go up in ultralights and gyrocopters crash and do half the job. Then they become a cost to the taxpayer for the rest of their lives. As I said to this person, you do not have the right to go up there, crash and wipe me or my family out. But, if people want to go up there and crash, provided they can give me a guarantee that they can do the job properly, I have no objection at all.

         Yesterday I mentioned that we were having the debate in relation to whether we have a popularly elected president and the difficulties I saw in that proposition, from the powers that would be gained by somebody whom we elected by popular vote in the country and how that could change the whole balance of power within our parliamentary system and that we need to have a debate about it. I think that, as people become more aware of the difficulties in that proposition, they may fall back to the minimalist approach of having the parliament elect a head of state by two-thirds majority. Of course, that will be a debate and we have plenty of time to have those discussions throughout the next few years.

         Personally, I am quite happy with our current constitutional monarchy. I know many of my fellow Australians are not, but at this stage I can see no reason to embark on any change. I know that some people are perhaps a little perturbed by the personal peccadilloes of some of the younger members of the royal family. I, quite frankly, cannot get terribly upset about that. I think they are probably not much different from those in the mainstream of society—unless they happen to be a British actor in Hollywood—but they get the focus of the media thrust upon them.

         I am reminded of a story about the death of King Edward VII. He was the one who in 1903 gave the provisional approval for the flag of Australia. When he died Queen Alexandra said, `Well, at least I now know where he is at nights.' He was a known strayer and wanderer. I do not think members of the current royal family are very different from those of the past. Certainly those of the past did not have the media spotlight on them the way members of the royal family do now.

         Australia is one of fewer than 10 countries that have been continuous democracies for all of this century. Bear in mind that, at the last count I know of, there are 184 countries in the United Nations. Fewer than 10 of them have enjoyed the same degree of democratic stability as we Australians have enjoyed. I think that is a valid point. What we have is very important and very worth while. The freedom and the liberty that we enjoy in our democracy are a very fragile flower, and over the decades since we became a nation hundreds of thousands of our fellow Australian men and women have fought for this country and suffered; and an enormous number died to preserve what we have got, which is protected by our constitution.

         In fact, it is well worth remembering in this context that at the Versailles peace conference after World War I we were represented by our then Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, and we were seeking to gain the mandate of German New Guinea which, to use the modern word, we had liberated. There was a fair bit of opposition to that, led by the United States. President Woodrow Wilson of the United States looked down his long nose, which was pretty long, and said, `By what right does the little country of Australia demand anything?' Billy Hughes leapt to his feet—which did not take him very far; he was a very tiny man—and said, `Mr President, by the right of 70,000 dead, which is more than you lost.' We normally do not remember—but Australians should remember—that in World War I we lost more people than did the whole of the United States. We had a population of four million, and 10 per cent—400,000—volunteered. It is an incredible story. While that does not specifically relate to the question of the republic, it relates to freedom, liberty and democracy—the cornerstones of this country.

         We should remember, as many people on both sides would agree, that we virtually have a republic already because, when the founding fathers were writing the constitution, they took the best that they could find all over the world. We had our fundamental basis in the Westminster system, but we also took from Washington. This is why many people describe our constitution as a `Washminster' constitution. It brought in the best of both worlds. It brought in the best of the American republic and the monarchy from England; and made it a peculiarly Australian thing. No other country in the world has exactly what we have. It is Australian, through and through.

         I know that the Prime Minister originally introduced the question of the republic as a red herring because he was seeking to take the economy out of the limelight and remove attention from unemployment. He wanted to take the focus away from them. Today, of all days, I should say that what he was seeking to do was to take away people's understanding of what was involved with the balance of payments. Today we have been told we have a balance of payments deficit of $2.9 billion. Boy, he needs some red herrings! The falsified deficit and the 32 per cent downturn in housing approvals are other things the red herring is all about.

I suppose when people fill their tanks they do not realise that 34c for every litre—over 50 per cent in some cases where petrol is cheaper—is going directly to the government in fuel tax.

         I have made no secret of the fact that I would prefer Australia to stay as a constitutional monarchy. If, however, the people of Australia decide that they want a republic, as I am a democrat through and through I will go along with that. But the people have the right to make the choice. The people must be given the right to make the choice, and not just on the Prime Minister's little model. As John Howard has said, we want to give the people of Australia a real choice.

The only decision to make—and this is particularly relevant to the next election—is whether the people want to vote for the Labor Party, which will give them only one thing to vote for, to say yes or no; or for the coalition, which is going to give the people of Australia the choice they deserve.

         —There are defining moments in history when we know that new courses are set and new opportunities open before us. We may call these paradigm shifts. It is my view that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in presenting his ministerial statement on the republic on Wednesday, 7 June presented us with one of these moments. In outlining the government's preferred model for constitutional change, the Prime Minister provided the Australian people with a significant opportunity to participate in a dialogue about this country's identity—past, present and future—and an invitation to decide on its constitutional arrangements as we approach the 21st century.

         The basic proposition is that we become a republic by the year 2001 and that our head of state should be an Australian citizen. It is really that simple. The main features outlined include the manner of appointing and replacing the head of state, who is eligible, the term of office and powers of the president and the position of the states to determine their own arrangements. The model has been described as the minimalist position because it does not interfere with the rest of our constitutional arrangements. The model gives increased power to the parliament to choose a head of state which, under present arrangements, is totally under the control of the Prime Minister.

        The Prime Minister's blueprint for an Australian republic has established the preferred position of the Federal Government in clear, thorough and precise terms. It confronts and addresses the constitutional amendments that need to be made, and sets a target for putting these to the people at a referendum midway between the next election and the centenary of federation. The Government has obviously been guided by the debate of the past four years. It has sensibly adopted the classic minimalist model for a transition that would, with the least possible fuss, construct a republic modest in nature but significant in what it says about Australian independence. For the first time, Australia would unambiguously become a nation governed by Australians with the Australian people in charge of a common Australian destiny.

        I will make some comments on the history of constitutional change to elaborate on that last point. It has often been stated that we have been an independent country since 1901.

         The referendum that they participated in in 1901 effectively made us a federation of six colonies under the sovereign power of the British government. The Commonwealth constitution, as the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) just alluded to, is a schedule to an act of the imperial parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The changes that have been made in the past 90 years have been the inevitable result of the changing destinies of the two countries, which was often resisted by conservative forces in the colony.

         In 1926, the imperial conference decided that the Governor-General would cease to be a direct representative of the British government and become a representative of the monarch in name and deed. Until this time all communications from the Australian parliament went via the Governor-General to the British parliament via the British Foreign Office. This change was sought by Canada and South Africa, not by Australia.

         In 1931, the Statute of Westminster removed the power of the British parliament to legislate on matters affecting the dominions without the consent of the parliaments concerned. Australia did not take up this option until forced to by the circumstances of 1942. On page 49 of Malcolm Turnbull's excellent book entitled

        Even after the outbreak of war Menzies continued to hope for a settlement with the Axis powers to resist Russia. His prolonged visit to England and his attempts to obtain a position of influence in the British war cabinet left Australia exposed and vulnerable. On pages 52 and 53 of Turnbull's book it states:

        He states further on in his book that the British government, in its desire to involve America, was in fact increasing the likelihood of war in the Pacific because it knew the only way it would get the assistance of America was to have Japan come into the war. As we know—and it is a matter of historical record—Britain's promises to be able to protect Australia proved to be absolutely unfounded. As we know, Churchill spoke about the poor quality of Australian fighting forces, which was to his eternal shame. That was very much the type of attitude that the British had to their colonial brothers.

         It was the Curtin Labor government that began to take a more independent line. The historical record indicates that there were monarchists on both sides of the House during that time. We understand the attitudes of that time. After World War II Australia entered a new era of conservatism and women were sent out of the factories, out from the farms and back to their kitchens. They were encouraged to return to the pages of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Women's Weekly
         </emphasis>
         and once again focus on their homes and their families and the new royal family as a way of handling postwar reconstruction. The Royal Styles and Titles Act 1953 included, for the first time, a reference to Australia but retained a reference to the United Kingdom. What Menzies said, quite accurately, in his second reading speech on the bill is referred to on page 63 of Turnbull's book. It states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The plain truth is that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth sits on the throne not because of some law of Australia but because of the law of the United Kingdom.

       <para>
        It was not until 1986, less than 10 years ago, that the current government passed the Australia Act 1986, which completed our effective independence from Great Britain. The bill had to pass through both the Australian and British parliaments and it thus effectively ended our colonial status. This ended the colonial status of our state governments and ended appeals to the Privy Council, rendering the High Court the ultimate court of appeal for Australia. Turnbull noted on page 70:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . a country which does not control its own judicial system and which cedes the right of final judgement to the courts of another country cannot be called fully independent.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it was not until 1986 that we became independent in the true sense of the word. That left us with the last anachronism: the Queen as our head of state. Turnbull described the monarchy as `the last fetter of colonialism'. Thirty years before him, in Dutton's book on the republic,
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australia and the Monarchy 1966
        </emphasis>
        , for which many of the contributors were vilified in Australian society, Donald Horne was quoted as asserting this in relation to the monarchy:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        She is not really our Queen. She does not stand for us. She stands as a symbol of how derivative we are, how provincial and second-rate . . . we think so little of ourselves that we do not provide our own Head of State . . . Our fictional allegiance to the Queen does not make us provincial. It is our provincialism that maintains our fictional allegiance to the Queen . . . A republican Australia would be forced to enter into a dialogue with itself on the question of what Australia was supposed to be about.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirty years later Turnbull was able to be more optimistic:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">

       </para>
       <para>
        The referendum proposed by the Prime Minister will be the first opportunity since Federation for the Australian people to have a direct say in our constitutional arrangements. As Turnbull says on page 9:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . to draw the line between the fearful handwringers clinging to the past, and those who have the courage to see the future and the hope to shape it, who have the courage to create national institutions that are meaningful for Australians.

       <para>
        That is what the Prime Minister's preferred model is about. If I may have an extension of time, when my time finishes, I would like to continue my remarks. What has been the response of the opposition parties to the Prime Minister's leadership in this matter?

         —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was about to say there are many issues, but this is an issue that throws into bold relief the lack of leadership in the coalition parties on this matter. It is no leadership to have the alternative Prime Minister of this country saying, `We'll give you the questions, the referenda, et cetera that you want,' without telling the Australian people what it is he stands for. Until the opposition is prepared to say what it is that it stands for, it will appeal to the lowest common denominator of politics in this matter. I believe that it is absolutely incumbent on the opposition to cease this kind of populism and put forward an effective proposal in response to the Prime Minister's preferred model.

         In addition, some minor amendments to the bill as introduced on 30 March 1995 are incorporated. The need for these has arisen following the consideration of submissions on the bill at the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee public hearing on 12 May 1995. The committee's report, recommending the enactment of the bill as drafted, was tabled in the other chamber on 1 June 1995.

         This bill marks the government's legislative response to the recommendations by the committee of review of the Australian Customs Service which was tabled in the parliament on 8 February of last year. The committee, which was chaired by Mr Frank Conroy, with Ms Susan Ryan and Mr Ian Macphee as members, conducted a wide ranging examination of the organisation, operations and practices of the Australian Customs Service.

The need to change the thinking, culture and operational approaches of Customs, which have been dominated by an emphasis on revenue collection and law enforcement, was accepted.

         The first reform is to bring the power of seizure under judicial control by requiring seizures to be sanctioned by a judicial officer having regard to the appropriateness and necessity of seizure in all the circumstances, before the seizure can be effected. This appears as the new subdivision D of division 1 of part xii of the Customs Act 1901. A similar extension of judicial control over the granting of search warrants for evidence of an offence under the Customs legislation is also proposed, and appears in subdivision C of division 1 of part xii of the act.

         The second substantive reform proposed in this area governs activity post-seizure. The government considered that the corollary to reform of seizure at the front end necessitated similar reform once a seizure was effected. Hence the provisions in subdivisions F and G of division 1 of part xii of the Customs Act 1901 to make clear that one's ability to retain that which has been seized is expressly dependent upon the bringing of the proceedings which justify the seizure in the first place.

         Giving effect to these two major policy reforms has involved a substantial rewrite of division 1 of part xii of the Customs Act 1901. That in part was made necessary because it was considered current policy on the use of search warrants by Commonwealth officers—including the contents of the warrants and their execution—which were contained in the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment 1994 Act, passed by this parliament last year, had to be reflected in these Customs Act 1901 provisions. The provisions contained in new subdivisions A-K of division 1 of part xii of the Customs Act 1901, inserted by schedule 2 of this bill, have thus been modelled with strict adherence to that precedent.

The government accepted the Conroy report's view that, for Customs to meet the government's industry oriented policies, a structure was required to provide the minister with clear power to communicate policy focus directions to Customs. The amendments proposed in schedule 3 of the bill should meet this need.

         The second major policy initiative reflected in the bill concerns the extension of certain administrative elements of the rules of origin preference concessions to Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the other forum island countries. In April 1994, Australia implemented new rules of origin legislation to give effect to the agreement reached with New Zealand in the context of the 1992 review of closer economic relations, CER, and to extend to other preference countries the administrative and technical aspects of that agreement. Australia has now made commitments with Fiji in respect of the rules of origin arrangements applying to the forum island countries. The Australian textile, clothing and footwear industry, which is the domestic sector with the predominant interest in rules of origin arrangements relating to the forum island countries, was consulted during the negotiation phase.

Papua New Guinea is mentioned separately but conjointly in each case where the forum island countries are mentioned because, while it is party to the South Pacific regional trade and economic cooperation agreement, SPARTECA, between Australia and the forum island countries, for customs tariff purposes it is regarded as an entity independent of the forum island countries in recognition of its status under the Papua New Guinea-Australia trade and commercial relations agreement, PATCRA.

         In my following comments, reference to the forum island countries should accordingly be taken to include Papua New Guinea. The new provisions for the forum island countries include inland freight from the port or airport where the materials are last landed in the preference country manufacturing the goods to the factory in that country, and it will become allowable expenditure. Inland freight is already an allowable expenditure where it relates to materials which originate in the preference area.

         The legislation will, in addition, recognise as allowable expenditure the inland freight component applying to materials originating from outside the preference area. The concession on inland freight will only be available to the forum island countries; it will not apply to New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia or the developing countries. Inland freight on the foreign content of materials will not be eligible expenditure if it occurs in Australia or in a forum island country other than that forum island country manufacturing the preference goods.

         The cost of materials for manufacture of the final product will be considered to be totally of allowable expenditure where the allowable expenditure on these materials which is contributed by Australia and the forum island country where the last process of manufacture occurs is at least 50 per cent.

         The bill removes the requirement, where New Zealand content is involved, for the forum island countries to achieve at least one half of the minimum 50 per cent of the total factory cost, with the balance made up from Australia and New Zealand. Prior to duty free trans-Tasman trade, it was necessary to ensure that the forum island countries were not used as a means to get goods into Australia duty free which were essentially the manufacture of New Zealand and, as such, subject to an import duty. Trans-Tasman trade became duty free in 1990, so this provision no longer serves any useful purpose.

         The two per cent margin of tolerance on the 50 per cent qualifying content requirement as agreed with New Zealand will be extended to the forum island countries. This means that, where the percentage of allowable factory or works cost for a forum island country's shipment of particular goods would have been 50 per cent if it had not been for some unforeseen circumstance, such as a fluctuation in exchange rates, which is unlikely to continue, and the allowable factory or works costs for those goods is not less than 48 per cent, then, for the purpose of that shipment and subsequent shipments of similar goods affected in the same way over a specified period, the allowable factory cost will be deemed to be 50 per cent. The intention of this provision is to allow a limited period of time for adjustment where goods fail temporarily to meet their requirements because of unforeseen circumstances. It is not intended to provide a long-term or a generally applicable de facto reduction from the 50 per cent of total factory cost requirement to 48 per cent.

         The bill amends the legislation to allow manufactured materials sourced wholly within a qualifying area to be included in the allowable expenditure on materials. The omission of this facility was an unintended oversight when the rules of origin legislation was put in place. In addition, the bill makes minor technical amendments to the provision requiring artificial elements of cost to be disregarded. The provision will now relate to preference claim goods rather than materials. It will allow the cost of material to be disregarded where they are added or attached to the preference claim goods solely for the purpose of artificially raising the allowable factory cost of the goods. The revised legislation will more accurately reflect the 1992 CER agreement on this aspect.

         Except for the new provisions on inland freight for forum island countries, the rules of origin provisions will apply from 1 April 1994. The inland freight provision will be implemented from royal assent. In addition to the above two major policy initiatives, the bill also proposes amendments to the Customs Act 1901, to insert new provisions to govern the movement of goods where there has been a technical breakdown of the ACS computer entry system, COMPILE, for a prolonged period; to the Customs Act, to specifically exclude the making of end-use tariff concession orders, TCOs, and to allow for the revocation of existing end-use TCOs; to the Customs Act and Excise Act 1901, to extend the provisions governing the sale of duty free goods to passengers departing Australia by sea; to the Excise Act 1901, to allow the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to review and replace excise by-laws which grant an excise duty exemption to the first 30 million barrels of crude oil recovered from certain onshore and offshore fields for a period of up to three years; and to the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Act 1994, to clarify the amounts that are available under this act for the payment of bounty. All of these purported amendments are dealt with in detail in the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

I grew up—and I am not being partisan; I want to paint what was the scene in my day—as a South Australian with Sir Thomas Playford as Premier, with Robert Menzies as Prime Minister and with Her Majesty the Queen. All was well, and, in my very limited vision, nothing was going to change. Of course, I was wrong, and the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) is amused at the very limited vision I had.

         Within this cosy environment, where you knew the people who were in office in the sense that they had been there a long time, I grew up secure in the role of the monarchy and the role of the parliament. I well remember as a 10-year-old in 1954 making the journey to Renmark in the Riverland area of South Australia to view Her Majesty as she came on her first visit to Australia. Even today I can recall standing with all the other school children from my school and watching the Land Rover, in the traditional Land Rover stamp of the 1950s, drive by with Her Majesty on board.

My point is that the coalition recognises, as I do, that the world has changed dramatically since those 1954 days. In many ways it is now a smaller place. My parents told me that I would never again experience seeing Her Majesty first-hand. However, it has become an experience that we now take for granted—an experience that, as parliamentarians, has been accentuated to the degree that many of us have had the pleasure of meeting her face to face.

         What I found particularly distressing about this debate is that I stand here as someone who is an unashamed conservative. As recently as two decades ago I would have said, `A republic? No way.' Even on coming into opposition I would have said, `A republic? No way.' Five years ago, I would have said, `A republic? No way.' In June 1995 I stand in this House alongside every other member of this party and none of us has said, `Let's oppose outright what the government is doing.' We stand here entertaining this possibility, reluctant and uneasy about it, unsure that it ought to proceed but at least entertaining the idea. Along with those opposite, my experience has been that my teenage children are saying to me, `Dad, get with it.' Whether they are right or wrong, I am not sure. But I have been more than a little bothered to have witnessed this debate and to have been treated by members opposite to nothing but perpetual criticism about the opposition's stand.

         I wonder what members opposite would have said had the coalition come into this parliament and said all that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) offered in his republic statement was nonsense and that we were not prepared to entertain it at all. Instead, quite frankly, for the first time in my parliamentary life, I walked out of the chamber after that June statement and conceded that the Prime Minister had been statesmanlike in his delivery and in the material he offered. No-one opposite has conceded in the debate that the opposition has taken a relatively progressive stance to this, given that our role is to express the concerns of all of those people who did not vote for the government.

         I think we need to recognise that the people of Australia and even the people of the Australian Labor Party now in government have not abandoned the role of Her Majesty nor the role of the monarchy. They have not called overwhelmingly for change. Instead, what we have here is healthy debate. I would hope the member for Macquarie in her characteristic way will recognise that, because from this side of the House there has not been outright opposition. There has been one overriding concern about this debate expressed by the opposition. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said in his response to the Prime Minister's statement, `We want to ensure that, if a change occurs, it occurs with the overwhelming endorsement of the Australian community.'

         We do not want nor, I believe, does the government—certainly not those presently in the parliament—a 51 per cent change or its equivalent in constitutional terms, a change that meant we were uncertain, when one holds a referendum. We want an overwhelming change that says Australians are happy to embrace a dramatic new direction for Australia. Failing that, we should not change at all. Why? Quite frankly, because the present system has served and is continuing to serve us very well.

         The first thing we need to recognise is that a change will not of itself solve any of the underlying problems that we face as a nation. A change does not mean that we suddenly become more gregarious and more accepting of each other. A change may mean that we have a greater sense of national identity as indicated by a number of speakers opposite, but it will not of itself solve problems. So it should not be entertained until we are certain that the majority of Australians overwhelmingly want that. Many of those opposite concede that.

We are not proposing to take anything away; we are proposing to consult the people of Australia and go on consulting the people of Australia until we are certain that the questions that we put to them in a referendum are questions that will reflect their real concerns and allow them to express an informed point of view.

But this is not a case of electing someone to govern us, but someone who will either become or continue to be a figurehead. The honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) expressed some concern about the fact that he had, in his terms, to swear an oath to a person who was not a resident of Australia. That is not a concern I can exactly reflect. I do not consider myself to be swearing an oath to someone who is not an Australian when I swear an oath to Her Majesty.

         There is little doubt that the system may be improved on, but before we entertain any major changes we must first ascertain two things. Firstly, is what we are doing the will of the overwhelming majority of Australians? If it is not, let us inform them as best we can what the options are so that they can make a choice that will reflect the will of the overwhelming majority of Australians. So, first, let us see that what we are doing is something, overwhelmingly, that the nation wants us to do. Secondly, I think it is important that we ensure that what we are doing builds a better Australia. Unless it is significantly and dramatically better than the system that we currently have, I would suggest we proceed very cautiously or do not proceed at all until we are certain that there are real advantages not only economically but in terms of the cohesion of the nation with whatever else we entertain.

         When I was thinking about what I would say today I went back to 1988 to when I was an external student at the University of New England. I had the privilege of editing an edition of the student newspaper. The main title was `What is the future for Australia after 1988?' I wrote the central article in that edition, which was about why I felt Australia ought to become a republic. When I dug it out of the yellowing shelves of my cupboard, I read it again and discovered that some of it was obviously out of date. I was delighted to see that some of the things I said about Australia at that time have improved, but some of them I think still bear repeating. So much of what I am saying will be direct quotes from that speech, with a little bit of editing.

         In this article, and in my speech subsequently, I focused on the psychological reasons for becoming a republic. Being a student of history at the time, I learnt a lot about the way countries, nations and people who rule them operate and the psychology that goes with that leadership. The thing that focused my attention most of all was reading in one of my textbooks about the day when the shiny white ships of the US Navy sailed into Sydney Harbour. At the same time the colonial powers in Australia were writing to the colonial office in London saying, `Please, sirs'—I imagine them tugging their forelocks at the same time—`can we please have a navy, commanded of course by British officers?' The incongruity of that struck me very greatly. I know that America was a little bit older than us but it seemed to me that the advance that that country had made over us was very great.

         Before I came to this place an invention in my electorate was brought to my attention. It was something very dear to my heart—and you may laugh when you hear this—effluent disposal and stormwater disposal, which are very important in areas of high environmental sensitivity. I tried to get some money for this. I toted it around every department and ended up almost screaming at one ministerial adviser, `God, you keep passing the buck from one department to another. Can't you all sit down together and decide what to do with this?' In the end that happened and I got some money for it from the now Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) through his water resources department.

         At that stage, I was working in the Agent-General's office for New South Wales when immigration was at its height and we were sponsoring migrants to New South Wales. She asked me what I did and when I told her she said, `I think it's a shame when people travel across the world to settle and don't realise that they are going to a different country with a different way of life.' A lot of people at that stage thought that Australia was just like England but with more sunshine and more money.

         The other argument that is often put up is that we already have an Australian head of state—namely, the Governor-General. If you had read some publicity in the last year—maybe even less—about experiences where the Governor-General went to visit some countries overseas, those countries had to send a cable to Britain to say, `Who is this guy? Is it all right if we receive him? Is he really the head of state of Australia?' I think it is acknowledged everywhere that the Governor-General does not get the same welcome as a true head of state.

         There is another example of the difference between having a head of state who is one of our nationals, who lives in this country and who primarily has our interests at heart. I think that is the nub on which the issue rests, as I think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might have said in his speech. When the Queen travels abroad, she is representing the United Kingdom. She is often meeting heads of state and business heads in those countries and she is drumming up trade for Great Britain. In many cases we are a competitor for trade with Great Britain. So she is working with our opposition in many ways.

         At a Rotary dinner in my electorate not long ago, the guest speaker was Bruce Baird, who was then a New South Wales government minister. As everyone knows, he headed up the bid for the Olympic Games. He said, `I have always been a republican but, had I not been, I certainly would have been after the Olympic bid.' He drew attention to the fact that the daughter of our head of state was part of the bid team for Manchester. So she was working in competition with our bid. And that is quite right: she is part of the British royal family and she was there to do that. However, when it was knocked out, she then supported our bid. Much was made of the fact, with people saying, `Oh, she supported our bid. But if Manchester had been in the running she would have been dead against us.' This is not a royal family bashing exercise, nor is it an anti-British exercise. We are merely saying, `We have grown up, we are old enough now to stand on our own and have our own head of state'.

         I wanted to talk about the mechanisms, and I think the honourable member for Wakefield dealt with those extensively. I understand the feeling of people when they ask, `Are we going into the unknown?' and, `Can we take the Australian people with us?' Perhaps I cannot officially apologise to him for some of the words from others on this side, but I agree with him that it should be a bipartisan move. It will not succeed unless it is a bipartisan move. We all know that. I know that there are many people on the other side of the House who support the republic and always have. There may be one or two on our side who do not—perhaps one—so that cuts across the board as well.

How we do it is something that is still to be developed. In his speech, the Prime Minister said that there would be extensive community consultations on that. I am a firm believer in community consultations. I hold them regularly in my electorate on a number of issues that arise in this place, whether it is a report on sex discrimination, some change in the family law or whatever, because I know they are things that interest people in my electorate and I think they should have a chance to have an input.

But we did see President Chirac stand up with President Clinton and say, `I decided we should do this.' He used the word `I'. He did not say `We decided' or `The government of France decided', but `I decided'. That is the sort of thing that can happen if there is a popularly elected president.

The member for Wakefield has said that we have a good system; the Westminster system works well for this country; it is like democracy; it is not perfect, but it is the best we have. I think everybody in this place would agree with that. If we change the way the head of state is elected we will have a different form of government. That person will have more power than the Prime Minister and more power than anybody in this place and will, therefore, have the power, if he or she is so inclined, to say, `We are going to do it my way, not your way. You can sit in this parliament and debate all you like, but I have the power of the Australian people behind me to go ahead and do whatever I like.' This is the same as Jacques Chirac having the power of the French people behind him—even though a lot of them disagree with him at the moment. But once the Australian people realise that that is a problem they will see it the way we have set it out.

         I can see why having a popularly elected president is an attractive proposition to people. We are, after all, in a democracy and should have a chance of choosing the person we want as president. But, as has been said a number of times by many people in this place, the whole of Australia electing a person to be president would mean that everyone of voting age would have to vote and there would have to be a nationwide campaign. Who can afford a nationwide campaign? Extremely rich individuals, political parties, business groups or other organisations. Therefore, whoever is elected will be tainted by that form of election.

         The member for Wakefield agrees, even though the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who is at the table, disagrees, The member for Wakefield drew attention to the role of our current Governor-General, who was appointed by the government and has proved to be a statesman, as have other governors-general, whether they have previously been politicians or not. I think Sir Zelman Cowen or Sir Ninian Stephen, when talking about the two of them, said, `Neither of us would be president if it was left to the people to elect us,' because they were virtually unknown at the time they took over the job.

The second was, `Do you feel as though you have had enough of an opportunity to have your say?' The third simply was, `Do you wish to retain the monarchy or change to a republic?' The fourth was, `If you support the republic, what sort do you want?' The fifth was, `If you like the current system, why?' Then I asked whether they wanted referendums, people's conventions or something else.

         A curious array of answers has come back, and there is no clear theme. I think that reflects this debate, and it reflects the need for all of us as members to go back to our electorates and ask the people what they want. A gentleman from Kambah wants a republic. But he does not want minimalist change; he wants to change our current system beyond the head of state. He wants to have a referendum when a detailed proposal has been formulated. That answer was consistent in the pro-republican answers. This gentleman says he wants a republic but that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should not have the final say on the republican issue.

Indeed, this gentleman wanted an immediate referendum to solve the issue. That was another theme that emerged quite quickly: people are afraid of the divisive nature of this debate and the way that it has been carried out. Another one wanted a republic but was not sure of where the system should go. He wanted a people's convention to have his say. Another person did not know because both arguments have merit. Many people would say that. He did say, though, `We do not want a socialist republic or a socialist grab for power.'

         There are many people out there who do want a republic, but again this person said they wanted to change our current system beyond the head of state. This reply said that a referendum should be held in about two years so that there is time to discuss other constitutional changes. This is because in the electorate of Canberra we have an educated and a thinking population who want a system of government that will take them into the next century.

         However, many people said, `I do not know because the alternatives have not been examined.' One individual said, `I do not trust the current government; therefore my judgment is clouded.'

This person said, `If the thing ain't broke, don't fix it. I do not trust Keating.' Here is another one who wants an immediate referendum because they are satisfied with the current system and that we should retain the constitutional monarchy. A theme that emerged quite quickly was that those in favour of the constitutional monarchy believe they should be able to have the right to have an immediate referendum. The government intends to hold a referendum in three or four years.

         Most of the people that responded in favour of the monarchy—and here are a few more—said that they would prefer either an immediate referendum or a people's convention.

         A reply from another republican would also like a people's convention, but added the note, `Drop the matter immediately until the country is financially and economically viable.' So there is a theme out there that says people want to talk about and discuss this issue, but there is also an underlying fear that it is being used as a smokescreen. Another one stated, `Not to be considered with the national debt we have; an immediate referendum to resolve the issue.' Another one wants a constitutional monarchy: `No to the republic; it's the present government that is not working properly.'

         Obviously many people who feel most strongly about this issue are constitutional monarchists, and they have taken the opportunity to reply. But many people said that they were not sure they knew enough about either system and said, `Neither side is putting forward a clear debate. Please issue the pros and cons of both sides.' Here is another reply from a person who says he is a constitutional monarchist and wants an immediate referendum. His reply was, `Keating is ignoring the people as usual.'

Another theme that emerged was, `No change while our Queen is alive. No change of our flag ever.' It emerged quite quickly that a lot of the older people have great respect for the monarch, as I believe most of us here in the House would have. They feel that, out of due respect for the Queen, we should take our time.

         It is very clear out in the community that it is not just the republic that is in question; it is the whole system of government and its implications. Many people said they did not feel that changing to a republic would make them feel any more Australian. As that is one of the major reasons that is given, perhaps they would like to discuss that more. What people from both sides of the argument—from the monarchists and the republicans—wanted was clear and defined debate about the pros and cons of the system that both sides advocate.

         This reply is one I particularly like. It simply says, `Educate the public on our present system of stability and freedom and then have a referendum.' The replies go on and on. This answer reflected what many people felt, whether justly or not: `A change should not be made solely on the basis of Keating's hatred of everything British'—obviously from a constitutional monarchist. They said they were satisfied with the present system, did not feel they had had enough opportunity to have their say and, indeed, supported a referendum at the next election.

After the next election, and a coalition victory, democracy will continue in this country, when people decide through discussion, people's conventions and the referendum. It is clear that the people of my electorate, the people of Canberra, have important issues on their mind—unemployment, taxes and the deficit—but would like to be much more involved in the debate about how we are governed.

         It is very unfortunate that what we had was a series of different positions from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). He changed position over the weekend. We were all left in the dark for quite a while until further clarification was made as to what the position was. Policy was made on the run. The opposition leader obviously had misread the position of the Australian people, who are obviously, in a majority, supportive of a change.

         If you followed the speeches of the members of the opposition, you would have seen why the opposition leader was struggling. You would have noticed that the fundamental reason for the problem for the opposition leader is that his party holds so many different positions on the real substance of the issue, and that is how we should elect the head of state and what proposition should be put to the people in a referendum for their decision.

         We are left in a position where the opposition has had all of these different positions because of the divisions within it. You have got staunch monarchists—constitutional monarchists—who are 1,000 per cent committed to the monarchy and then you have got staunch republicans. Within the republican camp you have got divisions between those who want the president elected by the parliament and those who want the president elected by popular will. When you have got all those different positions within the one political party and then the leader of the party refuses to state his own position, no wonder we have got a situation in this country where constitutional change on this important matter becomes very difficult to achieve.

         It is very interesting that some members of the opposition have supported the proposal. The member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) was one. People have said that they personally believe that the president in a republic ought to be elected by a two-thirds majority of the houses of parliament: the same position as the Prime Minister. Of course, the member for Wakefield went on to say, `Yes, but of course I have got to take into account the fact that all the other members of my party have different views.' Therefore he supports what? A process which would further delay the whole issue, further create tension and division in society and further suggest to the people of Australia that there is something fundamentally wrong with the proposition put before them.

         It is very interesting to see how much ignorance there is on this subject. We have heard the opposition—the so-called conservatives of this country—talking about how important the Westminster system of government is to them. The Westminster system of government, Mr Deputy Speaker, depends on a very important fact—and that is that there will be no popularly elected head of government. If you introduce a popularly elected head of state, you compromise the Westminster system. That is not a statement of ideology on my part; it is simply a fact about political science. If you look at those nations that have tried to introduce an elected president—that is, a president elected by the people rather than by the houses of parliament—into the Westminster system, you end up with a situation in which you undermine the nature and structure of the Westminster system and you therefore undermine the system of democracy which we have here.

         As everyone knows, I am not of British background. It has been said by several speakers opposite that the Prime Minister is anti-British in wanting a republic. That is a nonsense. If you look at the proposition which the Prime Minister has put forward, it is a proposition which would, in fact, entrench the Westminster system, which is one of the most fundamental points that we have gained from the British heritage. The claim that the Prime Minister is being anti-British in wanting a republic of the model which he has put forward is a nonsense. It is another one of those scurrilous statements that members of the opposition have come up with against the Prime Minister in circumstances where they should have known better. The reality is that the Westminster system would be entrenched by the proposal which the Prime Minister has put forward.

         It is true that some nations that formerly had the Westminster system, or adopted some version of a Westminster system, also elect a president. But in those cases you have exactly what the Prime Minister warned of in his statement and what other eminent people, such as Sir Zelman Cowen, warned of an elected president: the problem of dividing power between the newly elected president, the Prime Minister and the parliament. You then get a conflict which would then have to be resolved by all sorts of mechanisms.

        The fundamental point here is that we do not want a situation where we confuse the constitutional picture and we have a president directly elected that can then challenge the power of the elected representatives. This was the view of the founding fathers. Alfred Deakin, at the time of the founding of the constitution, said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The ambition of the democracy of this country is an ambition to shape its laws, to guide its destinies, to widen its opportunities, to make life in this country better worth living than it has been hitherto. For this purpose, the position of a representative in any of these colonies is infinitely superior to that of the Governor-General.
       </para>
       <para>
        He was saying that if you are going to have power vested it has to be vested in the democratic chamber—in the House of Representatives in particular. These representatives have real power whereas the Governor-General's role is one of symbolic representation—not an unimportant office; nevertheless, an office which is not directly elected in any way and which does not challenge the direct election, role and sovereignty of the parliament. That was the view of Alfred Deakin. This is a very important principle that cannot be sufficiently emphasised and one which we need to reiterate on this issue. If this point is made clearly to the Australian people, I am confident that a majority of the Australian people will support a constitutional change along the lines suggested by the Prime Minister and embodied in a two-thirds majority of the members of the House selecting the president.

         Therefore, given that in our system it is extremely unlikely that any one political grouping would get more than two-thirds control of the House of Representatives and the Senate, agreement would have to be reached by all the major political parties, both for the candidature of the presidency and for the continuing actions of the president in relation to any constitutional question. This means a consensus model—a model which tries to achieve consensus between both sides of the House of Representatives and both sides of the political fence, and indeed third parties as well. So that is the model which is obviously, as I said, consistent with the Westminster system but also positive in terms of what it can achieve with respect to consensus in this nation.

Mr Deputy Speaker, whatever model of elected president you look at, you will see that the reality is that in all jurisdictions where the president has been directly elected there have been problems in terms of the powers of the president and the powers of the parliament.

         I think the honourable member for Macquarie (Mrs Deahm) referred to the enormous powers of the French President. If we look at the original intentions of the French presidency, we will see that the idea was that the powers were to be shared between the president and the parliament of France. What has happened? The French President's powers have been increasing all the time because of the potential of the President to actually sack the government of France.

         As I said at the beginning, the Prime Minister's comments were certainly not anti-British. They were based on a fundamental respect for the key features of the Westminster system. He was saying, `Let us not move towards the dangerous door of having an elected president, where that personality can gain more and more powers even if they are not stated at the beginning.' As Sir Zelman Cowen said, those powers can develop over a period of time and then you would have conflicts between the elected government in terms of the parliament—the House of Representatives and the Senate—and the president.

We became a penal colony. Tasmania was hived off as a separate colony. Other colonies were formed in Melbourne, originally near Brisbane, a free settlers settlement was set up in Adelaide, there was a somewhat ambivalent convict colony in Perth, and various other parts across Australia were settled for all sorts of reasons and in different times up until the 1850s.

         Between the mid and late 19th century, they became self-governing colonies or states. Following their obtaining independence, there was a move from the mid-1850s through to the turn of the century for some form of Australian unity. That required a series of gatherings across Australia and constitutional conventions, some of which some states approved and others did not. After a long and tortuous system, eventually we became a Commonwealth in 1901. I am sure we all honour that day, which was certainly a definitive day in Australia's history.

         Between 1926 and the Second World War, any mechanisms were totally removed that might have tied us to the British parliament. Our relationship became that with the Queen as our head of state, and not with some intermediate force. In 1953, with the Royal Style and Titles Act, all the forms and titles, including Queen of Australia, became part of our constitutional background. In other words, by that stage our whole constitution had become inherently Australian.

         This progress in evolution will continue and will be coloured by several factors—factors that will be beyond our control as Australians. One of those will be the degree and form of European unity. A matter of grave contention at this very moment in Great Britain is the extent to which that country should be Europeanised—whether its currency should be Europeanised and so on. There will be factors that change this relationship. I want to argue the case for an evolutionary process. While it is all well and good to set targets for the year 2000 or the year 2001, it is infinitely more important that we get it right.

         To be quite honest, I favour the current form and style of government. This is not based for one minute on any Anglophile leanings. It is not for nostalgia either, nor is it for any fawning regard for the British royal family, much as I admire the Queen and many of those in the line of succession. I have always seen the strength in the monarchy not being in the power vested in Elizabeth Windsor but in the power that is denied to all others. It is a unique reserve power that distinguishes monarchies that have adopted this system from all other forms of government. Some of the longest running democracies in the world and the most stable governments are monarchies in that mould. You would probably cite one of two exceptions to the rule. I am not saying that it should be exclusive but this is the rationale of where I come from.

         As I said, the strength of the monarchy is not in the power vested in Elizabeth Windsor but in the power denied to all others. As the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) said, the great dilemma that we face if we are to become a republic is whether a president should be elected by two-thirds of the parliament or by popular vote. Once you vest, by popular vote, a head of state with powers, there is an added reserve power that you cannot deny him or her, and that is the one of popular election. In terms of popular election, that person holds a de facto power greater than that of the Prime Minister, who at the end of the day is only the leader of the party with the largest number of seats in the House. That is the dilemma.

         My other reason for supporting the current system is cultural. I do not mean cultural in the artistic sense of the word but in the broad sense. I refer to the influence on links with our judicial, legal, political, parliamentary, military and academic systems. I do not think we have thought through nearly well enough just how many of those things have to be changed in this headlong rush towards a republic by some members in this House. I would like to look at some of the arguments that have been thrown up. Time does not permit me to go into each argument in a great deal of depth. One argument is that we will at long last have an Australian head of state. To all intents and purposes, that has been the case for at least the last 30 years and many before that.

         Another argument put forward concerns our place in Asia. Anyone who has anything to do with Asians will realise that they have a great deal of respect for family, a great deal of respect for integrity and a great deal of respect for not compromising themselves. Once you compromise yourself, you lose face. If you lose face in the Asian dimension, you are a nothing. Only in the last week Professor Claudio Veliz was back in Australia. He is a former professor of sociology and history at La Trobe University. In an address to Australians, Professor Veliz asked, `Are you really on the right track, wanting to become de facto Asians?' He was not suggesting for a minute any Asian push in Australia. He is asking whether we are approaching our relationship with Asia in the right way. He is quoted as follows:

        I will just take tourism as an example. People do not come to Australia because we are another Asian country. They come here because we are distinctively something else. We are, on the one hand, a great environment with a huge mass of natural attractions and, on the other hand, to some extent an extension of Western culture in the Pacific. That is why the Asians come here. That is why the Japanese girls want to be married in white dresses and so on—because they want to capture some of our culture. Why we would want to surrender that sort of thing so willingly to become, if you like, as much a fawning appendage of Asia as you claim we have become a fawning appendage of England, I would not know. To some extent it would be going from the frying pan into the fire. So that is that Asian argument.

         Another argument is that we need a more full and comprehensive sovereignty. We have never lacked sovereignty in this country. As I have explained earlier, the last residual processes—and the one I did not mention, of course, was appeal to the Privy Council—have long since passed. But for people to argue that case and to then so freely surrender our sovereignty to certain United Nations conventions does not add up. I do not argue against all United Nations conventions. I do not argue against the law of the sea, the rules of exchange, the rules of customs and extradition or the air and navigational regulations. I have no argument with any of those. They are all sensible. I could even stretch my reluctance to accept some, not all, of the applications for World Heritage listing, recognising that certain parts of the world belong to all the world, because if they are damaged by one nation they are damaged for all. But I do not believe, for example, that that should extend to our own national parks. For God's sake, we don't need someone in New York telling us what we should do. We do not deserve them if we need someone from outside telling us what to do.

         Finally, another argument is that not being a republic is somehow offensive to people of ethnic background. I find that a very tortuous argument. In my own electorate, although there are a lot of ethnic groups, especially Italians, they are very loyal monarchists, strangely. Many of them are very reluctant to change, although I concede that some of more recent times do not have that attitude. Certainly, Italians who have lived here for two, three and four generations are very much in the mould of respect for the monarchy. So I do not think that that is an argument.

My experience has been, especially with Italians and Irish—you may find that unusual with the Irish—that there has been a great deal of loyalty to the British system.

If he had been a bigoted Irishman, it was a rather strange thing for him to accept the knighthood of the British Crown.

         I do not care if you are a republican or if you are a monarchist, but I think that crass, coarse display down by the lake, with which at least the instruments of government were reluctant to intervene, really denigrated us. Whether you are a monarchist or a republican, your head of state is the unifying symbol of your country. Whether you like our head of state or not as a person or whether you like the system or not is not important. It was appalling that our head of state, the symbol of our unity, and her consort could be denigrated in such a way, and that the instruments of government took so long to do something about it. You might be pardoned for saying there was almost a silent revelling in this denigration of the British monarchy. But what would the circumstance have been if down by the lake we had had a statue of President Suharto and his wife or Prime Minister Mahathir and his wife? There would have been an outrage. There would probably have been a diplomatic incident about it, and it would have been removed from the site of Lake Burley Griffin in double-quick time, because it would have been an embarrassment for us to have one of our neighbours denigrated in such a way. Yet this maturity that we are supposed to have brought on ourselves of recent years was not sufficient for the sculpture of our own head of state to be wiped away.

         I just find some of those arguments go a bit too far. Let me speak for a short time on the Keating model. While I do not doubt the sincerity of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in wanting to put his case across, and while I concede, as the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) did, that it was a very polished performance, there were a few glib phrases in that speech that I suspect were there to mollify the public and, certainly, to mollify any opposition to the republic. For example, we are going to hold on to the title `Commonwealth'. We are not going to use the word `republic'. We are going to be a republic, but we will hang on to the word `Commonwealth' because that is soft and cuddly and people will like that; that will not get people's backs up. We will retain the reserve powers, though we know the Prime Minister detests them with a living hate. We will retain those because that will soften and mollify another group of the population. We will go for the minimus change because in the broad spectrum of things that will mollify yet another group. We will go for a two-thirds majority because that will cause the fewest ripples. That is where the whole system came unstuck. As we said, that is where the great dilemma exists in this debate.

         Let me, on that point, pose what might happen. Let us assume that we were a republic and we were coming up to one of these two-thirds majority cases. Let us say we had excluded all political candidates for the last five years, as is the proposed model. Let us say that there were two candidates and the opposition and the government each fervently wanted a different one of those candidates. They could not agree and both sides decided that they would not give the other side the two-thirds majority and they would not seek another candidate. There you would have the elements of another little constitutional crisis on your hands. Probably, at the end of the day, there would be a compromise. But I bring it up to show you that there are flaws in that system too.

         The whole Turnbull committee process set Australians into a mould of suspicion. That committee was virtually hand-picked by the Prime Minister. Other nominees, including the distinguished academic, because of their other leanings were not included. It was a stacked deck. It came up with a 500-page report for a minimalist option. That was the start. That was going to be the first throw of the dice in a democratic republican debate, yet the process itself was distinctively undemocratic.

It will allow the public, half of them elected and the other half appointed—and do not let us get all upset about the appointed ones; the state premiers and people like that have to be in the process—to be involved and it allows a filtering system to put up the options. If we go towards a referendum to either change the constitution or become a republic and if there is not broad community support, we are going to get one of two things. We will have the thing chucked out comprehensively and put this whole process back 20 years or we will have that 49:51 result that will divide this country.

         —The great difficulty with this debate on the republican statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is that, by and large, half of the debate is not around. Because the Liberal Party and the National Party are effectively hiding behind the proposal for a people's convention and not stating what they believe and what their position is on the key issues, it is very difficult to have a serious and genuine debate about the proposal for a republic.

         I exempt the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) to some extent from those remarks because he stated his position reasonably clearly in his contribution. The classic illustration of this was the speech by the member for Canberra (Mr Smyth), who told us the views of every constituent in his electorate but not his own. He failed to say what he believed. It was reminiscent of the

Do they believe that all Australian citizens should be eligible to occupy the position of head of state? The Liberal Party is hiding. It is trying to avoid these questions.

         This is leading to an upsurge of fairly nonsensical arguments coming from a variety of places and sometimes being reiterated by people on the coalition benches. My favourite is: `The republic will not cure all known diseases. It is not going to solve unemployment and crime and everything else, therefore, why should we do it?' It is not designed to do those things. Nobody claims it will. It is a bit like refusing treatment for measles because it will not also fix your broken leg at the same time.

         Then we have the `What are the benefits?' approach—`You tell me in dollar terms, or in concrete terms, what the benefits are.' It is legitimate to ask what you should have a republic for, but there are things that you cannot measure. For example, how do you measure the benefits of getting rid of a gerrymander in a state like Queensland? You cannot measure it in dollar terms but, clearly, a better, more honest, fairer and more representative system of government that is a better reflection of the Australian people is a good thing. It is something that we should aspire to, and to try to reduce this to dollar and cents terms is obviously ridiculous. So to ask, `What are the benefits?' is to narrow the question too much. It is a legitimate question, but it is only part of the question.

         Then we have the suggestion that this is all a diversion, that in some way there is a grand conspiracy—and there are lots of conspiracy theorists always lurking on the opposition benches—and that this is just a diversion from the real problems of the nation. It is suggested that the ordinary people out there in the community—from day to day they face a whole variety of economic problems, economic issues—could possibly be diverted from these concerns if we pursue a republic, as if this will distract them. Apart from anything else, it is a massive insult to the intelligence of the Australian people to suggest that we could possibly do something of that nature, even if it were sought to be done.

         Then there is the suggestion that this is a great conspiracy by the Prime Minister to ensure that he can become the first president of an Australian republic. The fact that the model that the Prime Minister has proposed more or less makes it impossible for him to be the first president does not seem to deter people from running this sort of theory. Then we have arguments that the debate is divisive and, therefore, we should not have it—a proposal is supported by some and opposed by others and therefore it is divisive, which is a bad thing, so let us sweep it under the carpet and forget it. The debate about Federation in the 1890s was fairly divisive at the time. There was strong opposition to Federation, including, for a fair time, from within the Labor movement. Yet I do not think anybody at the time suggested that, because it was divisive and there were different views, we ought to just forget it and say, `Okay, we'll leave things as they are because a few people disagree with it.'

In fact, there was a degree of whimsicality and almost melancholy in the voice of the honourable member for Hinkler when he went through the Prime Minister's proposal and pointed out that most of those things had been deliberately ruled out, as if some of the best weapons for a Liberal and National scare campaign had been removed.

         Then there is the suggestion that republics are chronically unstable, that they are inherently unstable, and that monarchies are inherently stable.

What makes a country stable is not its system of government; it is the nature of its people, its circumstances, its history, its culture, its location and a whole range of issues. Systems of government obviously have some influence in this but, ultimately, a relatively minor influence compared with the greater issues of substance.

         The honourable member for Hinkler this evening has again managed to make sure that facts did not get in the way of a good story. He suggested that we are in some way bound by international conventions, without this parliament even being able to debate the proposition. That is quite clearly not true. In order for an international convention that Australia becomes a signatory to to have any impact within this country, this parliament has to pass legislation that is based on that convention and, in all the examples that he presented to the parliament, that is precisely what has occurred: legislation has been put to the parliament, debated and passed. Even the recent situation with Teoh's case, which produced something of an indirect exception to this rule of international conventions being taken into account in legal interpretation of administrative decisions based on legislation, the government proposes to take legislative action to limit that exception so that the same principle still stands—the international convention, whatever it relates to, will have effect in Australia only if this parliament legislates accordingly.

         I turn to the matters of substance in the proposal. I am happy to support the Prime Minister's proposal as a broad proposition, but I would prefer a popularly elected president. If that is not to be the case, I certainly think the proposal is a worthy one and something I will be happy to support, along with the rest of the Australian Labor Party. But there is a finely balanced debate on the question of a president appointed by the parliament as opposed to one being elected by the people. I think one of the tragedies of the debate is that the opposition is failing to debate this finely balanced issue. I have a personal preference, but I am open to being persuaded otherwise.

         I would like to put a few points to the House tonight. The first is the notion that we should have a non-political person in the position. It is the powers of the position and the nature of the position that make it political, not the person who is in it. The question is what is the role of the position, not what tasks does it require the performance of. It is a central part of our political system, and that is why it will be, to a certain degree, political. This focusing on the individual who will be in it is quite wrong. Fortunately, the government has eschewed some of the more elitist and nonsensical suggestions about how we could acquire a president—for example, having an eminent persons committee that could vet nominations. If you have ever heard anything more ridiculous and elitist, I would be interested to hear it.

         The suggestion that we would end up with a party hack if we had a popularly elected president is misconceived. The balance between the two major parties in Australia has historically been relatively even and there would be a substantial proportion of the community in the middle that would simply not vote automatically for the candidate of either party's selection without considering the merits of the individuals. The end result of that would be that both parties would tend to put up candidates who, although they had leanings towards the Liberal Party or the Labor Party, would clearly stand on their merits as people who would undoubtedly perform the obligations of the position responsibly, in accordance with their constitutional obligations and without fear or favour to the party to which they had leanings.

         The other issue that is cited is the potential clash between a popularly elected president and the Prime Minister and government of the day. That does exist, but it means that you would have to have very clearly codified powers. The same problem could arise with a president elected by the parliament, in this way: it requires a two-thirds majority to dismiss a president under the proposal. If we have a president who has been elected by a two-thirds majority of parliament who then gets into some sort of clash with the government, and maybe exceeds his or her powers, how likely is it that the opposition of the day is going to join with the government and help the government dismiss that president? It is almost a certainty that the party in opposition would make use of that opportunity to harass the government and support the president, hence you would still have a problem. The key question is what that person's powers are, and that is why I feel that this is an overstated concern about a popularly elected president.

         My basic principle is that any major position in our political system should be directly elected by the people. There needs to be very strong reasons why it should be otherwise, and I am not as yet convinced that in this case those reasons are overwhelming. I think the Prime Minister's point of view, that the diffusion of power through the Westminster system and the fact that the Prime Minister and other ministers are not directly elected by the people, does have some merit. However, there is not a direct analogy here because the point remains that the Prime Minister and ministers are still elected by the people. The Prime Minister has to get here as the member for Blaxland. He is still elected by 70,000 or 80,000 people, so there is at least some degree of a democratic base through direct popular election. The president, under the current proposal, would not be elected by the people at all. It is not a direct analogy.

         When I was a young lad going to primary school and then on to high school, I remember vividly pictures of the late King George VI and his Queen and their family in Britain and travelling around the world. Of course, not long after that King George VI died. But also since that time and now in the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War, we see the old Movietone news of the King and the Queen walking around the ruins in London and other parts of England, buoying up the British and representing, as they did then, the old British Empire and later on the British Commonwealth.

         Even allowing for that as a youngster, I was very much a republican. I did not believe in royalty or anything like that. I believed that we should have a republic or some such thing. That was before I got to know the rich heritage of our Westminster system, the parliament, the fact that we had a constitution and that that constitution was very important. Later I also learnt about the great stability that that constitution brought to Australia and its people.

Some writers say that we have almost an 80 per cent republican system in Australia today, if you can judge it in percentage terms.

The great migrations after the Second World War brought many people to our land who were not of British heritage. They came from all over the world—refugees and people who were migrating to find a better way of life. They did not come to Australia because we did or did not have a constitutional monarchy, or we were a republic, or anything else; they came because they believed that Australia was a free nation. They believed that it must have a decent system of government if it was a free nation and they believed that it promised them something.

         I was very surprised to hear the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) say that he had spoken to the heads of the various ethnic groups and that they believed in a republic. While I do not disbelieve him, it is a bit like saying that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) represents the workers of the country. This is obviously and patently not true, because we have all come to know that really we have a Prime Minister who is a bit of a Bollinger socialist, I suppose—like some of the people who are with him.

Strange as that may seem to us here, they have done so because they wanted a head of state who was separate from the local politics of their country. They believed that, if they could get someone who was completely independent, they would not run the risk of having unrest within their nation. In fact, when talking about a monarchical system, with the handing down of duty from father to son or mother to daughter—although I believe that it will be up to the Australian people to decide this issue—one problem which is not usually had is that of complete political unrest in a nation.

         True to the Australian Labor Party's 1993 election commitment, and in the wake of the Republic Advisory Committee's report, the Prime Minister has welded together a very logical proposal just as Australia stands poised to take up republicanism. Not surprisingly, ideas in many areas have changed dramatically since Queen Elizabeth II visited our shores for the very first time in 1954. Forty years ago polls showed that 77 per cent supported a monarchy. Recent polls show that that support is now down to 48 per cent. Realistically—and that is why I quoted those figures from 1954—that figure of 77 per cent illustrates that even then not every Australian supported the monarchy. They were not hostile to the monarchy, but they were not committed monarchists.

         Contemporary moves towards republicanism have nothing to do with opposition to Britain; rather they are a manifestation of Australia and Australians having grown and become more economically independent and more culturally diverse.

The member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) brought up a questionnaire that he conducted through a newspaper. I do the same thing in my electorate daily. Fairfield City Council, which is in my electorate, represents a population of some 190,000 people of 135 nationalities. It boasts an elected council where 50 per cent of its councillors come from ethnic backgrounds. This reflects clearly the notion that people want their elected officials to be representative. Let us transpose that to Australia nationally. Fairfield Mayor, Tony Campolongo, who incidentally is of Italian heritage, stated:

        They are his words, not mine. My community reflects that. I will also look at the area of trade. Trade will be beneficially influenced by the transition to the republic as presently we must be sending out some very confusing messages to the other nations. We have to be aggressively Australian and we have to wholeheartedly go out and trade in our own right. On that score, the monarch's interests and ours differ significantly from when we still exported our wool to England.

         I ask my colleagues to consider this: whenever the Queen visits another country she does so, as other speakers have stated, as the Queen of England. When do we see newspapers report that the Queen of Australia is visiting the United States? Take the example of the heir apparent to the Australian head of state, Prince Charles. He was in St Petersburg last year leading a delegation of representatives of major British business houses. The heir apparent was there campaigning against Australia's interests. He was there to promote British, not Australian, products. Why should he not? Such a use of his time must seem very sensible to the average British taxpayer, but it certainly does not seem sensible to the Australian taxpayer. How can he really purport to be our true representative when he continually has this conflict of interest?

         Imagine for a second a major world trade fair where a British stall and an Australian stall are erected side by side and the Queen is there. What would be the perception about who she represents? Ironically though, our head of state would actually be representing another country and another country's goods. We all know that that would happen and we all must acknowledge that. Realistically, it is to our advantage economically, culturally and tourism and trade wise to look to our own needs rather than maintaining a symbolic identification with Great Britain, which is what happens at the moment.

         I have listened to some of the speeches from members of the opposition and heard them arguing the toss about the symbolism derived from the British monarchy. Eminent people, such as former High Court Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, argue that a monarch is a symbol of national unity. Certainly many people agree with that sentiment, including those who have come from countries which have a monarch as their head of state. It can also be argued that the so-called unifying role of monarchical rituals such as royal tours or awards by members of the royal family may be detrimental to our society. Indeed, such rituals may hinder development of a relevant ideology or a unifying culture.

         To achieve such unification and sense of common purpose we must support the tenets of the Prime Minister's proposals. We must become a republic no later than the year 2001. The Prime Minister's proposals are logical and clear cut: a referendum should be held no later than 1999; the president of the Commonwealth of Australia is to hold the post for five years with no second term and he or she must be an Australian citizen; the president will be nominated by the Prime Minister with prior bipartisan agreement and chosen by two-thirds majority of the parliament in a joint sitting; politicians will have to have been out of office for five years before they can be nominated for the office; and the president will have the same powers as the present Governor-General.

         The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) says that he would stage a people's convention in 1997 to examine the Australian constitution. But his proposals are vague and non-specific and certainly lack substance. Even the Leader of the Opposition's deputy has refused to commit himself to all aspects of this position. Such ideas raise questions like: what sorts of people would he appoint; and would he stack it with monarchists? As cynical as that sounds surely he is simply trading on anti-politician sentiment, for who could be more representative of the people than elected parliamentarians?

         If we took his option one step further, we would need an American style election campaign. Electing a president thus is simply not appropriate for the Australian system. In electing our Prime Minister, we do not have an American system of direct elections; it is a more intricate process than that. Further, a people's convention is really just the people electing a body of representatives which is essentially what they already do now via our political system. Conversely, the Prime Minister's approach to a referendum spells out the government's proposition to the people that is clear cut and easily understood.

You might imagine in London the weather is warm, the trees are green, the birds are singing, the grass in Hyde Park is growing rapidly in the heat and the Londoners are making their way to work. Among them are the foreign exchange dealers of the city, who are perhaps taking their places at their desks and are now reading the morning news and seeing that their cousins in Australia have suffered a current account deficit greater than any before. Perhaps the staff on the Strand at Australia House are discussing the same issue and wondering what their salary might be worth next week when the foreign exchange markets have dealt with us as harshly as I expect they will tonight.

If it were not for some of his remarks in question time last year, which were of a plainly anti-British nature, we would not be making that accusation today. There are those of us on this side of the House who are willing to accept that, in putting his proposal for a republic before the House on 8 June, some of that anti-British feeling which had infected his remarks in question time last year may have disappeared and that he is taking a slightly more objective approach to the task.

         One of the reasons put forward for this change—from a constitutional monarchy to a republic—is that somehow it would deliver more independence to Australia. That requires us to consider the notion of independence. What exactly do we need more than we have now and what would a change to the passport of our head of state deliver for us? Independence to me means sovereignty, and sovereignty means the control of your destiny. There are various forms of sovereignty. You can have civic sovereignty or civic destiny and the powers of a group of people in a particular location decide how their streets will appear and how much they should pay for their rubbish to be taken away.

         —Many people have criticised the honourable member for Watson, but never for a lack of diligence. Never let that be said. Another notion in this debate that the honourable member for Prospect raised, in an oblique allusion, was that somehow or other Australia's changing to becoming a republic would win us more market share in Asia. The chamber is no place for laughter, but I find it difficult to restrain, because the proposition that, somehow or other, by changing our constitution, we would win a greater market share in Asia is ridiculous. It is fatuous and ridiculous, and it would be an immature country that would take such a proposition seriously.

         People in Asia do not regard us as in any way diminished because of our history, because we still, in the 1990s, enjoy a constitutional monarchy. To change that to a republic would do absolutely nothing to improve the quality of the goods and the services that we seek to sell in those markets; nor, I think, would it do anything to lower the production costs of those goods.

         Asia itself is full of quaint things—of practices that many of us in Australia find bizarre, strange and quite alien to our own culture. It does not stop us from buying their products, and the reverse is exactly the same. That has been my personal experience.

         If you look around Asia at the sorts of constitutional systems that our neighbours there enjoy, you find examples of monarchy, or the equivalent term, where there is an emperor, such as in Japan. In Thailand they have a king who is revered by the people. In Malaysia every state has a sultan and every three years, I think, one of them takes the turn to be the chief sultan, the Agong. Likewise, they have a strong constitutional government, a vigorous one, as we have learned—certainly their rhetoric is vigorous. I have not heard Malaysian people complaining about their system of government, and yet their real incomes are rising at a greater rate than ours are.

         My own view of this debate is governed by the notion best expressed in the maxim festina lente, hasten slowly. Everything in my life that I have done in a hurry, I have done badly. If you hurry, if you rush to reform, you make a mistake nine times out of 10. The danger of haste is especially apparent in government. The danger of haste is apparent in many of the things that this government has done, perhaps at the time with sincerity, but certainly with a great deal of haste. Going back to the early 1980s, the notion of financial deregulation was all the rage, certainly from an outsider's point of view.

         It is plain to see that the changing nature of the royal family, the house of Windsor, is a factor in this process, in this evolution. There is no denying the proposition that republicans put that, when the heir to the British throne is seen in the markets of Saudi Arabia or other parts of the world, frankly and vigorously espousing the benefits of British products, it does raise doubts in some Australians as to whether or not the royal family is committed absolutely to its role in the Australian constitution.

         Finally, I want to mention a personal thing. I have a difficulty with the division of opinion between young Australians and elderly Australians on this issue. It seems very plain that elderly Australians are the ones who hold the constitutional monarchy most dear to them, and as someone who is only 34 years old I have some difficulty with rushing to change something that is so dear to a group of people who have made a greater sacrifice by the fact of their age than I have or than has anyone younger than I. That is not to say that the wishes of young Australians should not be taken into account in this process—not at all—but I have a deep feeling that there is some indecency in ripping away from elderly Australians something that they hold dear.

         I think the proposition that we are somehow rushing the decision that we should be a republic and that it does not form an evolutionary or incremental proposal is one I find difficult to understand. It seems to me that over 200 years ago or a little bit more, we—that is, white people—came to Australia and we had a very crude form of government with not much democracy. Our democracy and our form of government have been evolving ever since. Even with the approach of 100 years of federation in 2001, one can hardly say one is being radical and revolutionary to propose that in the 98th or 99th year of our federation we should be considering becoming a republic and that we should put that proposition to the people. I totally reject that argument.

         During federation, when we had dominion status, the United Kingdom was responsible for the conduct of foreign affairs and other matters. We have gradually gained more and more autonomy, and we now wish to become a republic. But even if you want to ignore all that has gone before, 1998-99 is some years away yet, so it is not as though we are having a debate in this parliament to decide, in the latter part of this year, that we shall have a referendum. That is absurd.

         If you take the position that you do not welcome the prospect that we will one day, eventually, become a republic, you are really saying that it does not matter whether it is the year 2000 or the year 2050—or maybe we will wait until the year 3000 before we become a republic. I cannot agree with that proposition. I have to be very frank with my electorate and with members of this House. Whilst I have always favoured a republic, I did not believe that I would see the prospect of it in my lifetime—as we on this side of the House, and as I think a majority of Australians, are now contemplating.

I am happy to concede—as I think most people who are looking at this debate dispassionately will, and as I am sure history will record—that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) deserves a tremendous amount of credit for advancing the whole proposition of the republic. That we should actually be at this point in 1995, having a firm proposal put before the House to be considered by honourable members and senators, to be thought through out there by the public and with an assurance by a Labor Party government that we will firmly put a proposition for a referendum to the people, has been an amazing development.

         It is very interesting too that one of the benefits of this republic debate is that there is far more consideration being given to the forms and structures of government—that is, the different levels of government: federal, national, state and local government—and that there is far more questioning in the community about whether the current structure serves us well. I know that some people argue, for example, that the proposals of the Prime Minister do not go far enough. I am not one of those, because, if referendums have taught us anything, it is that we need to keep things simple.

The voters of his electorate have suggested that we cannot become a republic until we are economically sustainable. That implies that Australia is receiving a bucket load of money from the United Kingdom because the United Kingdom is the residence of our head of state, the Queen of Australia, and ipso facto we are somehow receiving aid money. I presume that is being likened to the aid that Australia gives to Papua New Guinea.

         —My reason for joining the republic debate tonight is that I was very impressed by all of the speeches. I have sat here for about three hours this evening listening to them. I was especially impressed by the efforts and the remarks put forward by the members for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) and Wakefield (Mr Andrew). Now I have an opportunity to not only express this but also send these reports out to the different groups that I have organised to debate the republic. I think the speeches that have been made today will be a good subject for debate.

         My reasons for wanting a republic for Australia are as follows. The Governor-General, president or whatever he or she is to be called must be an Australian and must represent Australia when going overseas. The person must be dedicated to Australia and must speak only for Australia and not for any other country. For that reason, I believe he or she must be a fully elected Australian. I believe the election should be as suggested by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and I have no doubt that will be the eventual decision. It will be a decision that will eventually be dictated by the public of Australia. Whoever is finally selected, the person will represent Australia wherever he or she goes in all the world's forums. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) will prove to be out of line with his proposal of a group of citizens partly appointed and partly elected. One would have to be very wary about how they would be selected and how they would be appointed to carry out the public inquiry as to how he intends to set up the proposal for a republic or the expression of a republic.

I have expressed this opinion to my wife, Jenny, and our three daughters, Elizabeth, Sharon and Kathryn. It must be said that they have their own thoughts on this matter, but they all have a voting right and will have to vote either for or against the formation of a republic.

My grandson is to be named Daniel David. My granddaughter has given me a nickname. Emily calls me `Poppy', of which I am very proud. Daniel David may also call me `Poppy'. That remains to be seen.

         —by leave—Towards the end of this historic debate on the Australian republic, I wish to bring a tone of bipartisanship to our consideration of the issue. As you would appreciate, Mr Speaker, I have always fancied myself as one of the genuine moderates and conciliators in this place. I can say that in the typical absence of the member for Wills (Mr Cleary). As we draw to a close our consideration of the historic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I would like to advance a proposition on how the monarchy is best judged in Australia and beyond in the 1990s. I think it is a proposition which even the opposition would find attractive. That is, we should rely on the judgment of the British Scout Association. From the eyes of the opposition it would regard this as fair, reasonable and entirely appropriate. This is a British organisation associated with all the best values of duty, diligence and dedication. It could not ever be regarded as representing a fifth column or representing radical views in its society, nor in ours.

        In Britain, the scout association has begun moves to delete references to the monarchy from its oath because of Prince Charles's infidelity. Explaining his concerns, the UK chief scout, Mr Garth Morrison, said, `It will be hard for some people to promise to do their duty to an adulterer.'

        I do not mean to be harsh toward Prince Charles in this spirit of conciliation and moderation, but these are the words of the British Scout Association, not mine. I think it is a tell-tale sign in the history of the British monarchy. It is five minutes to midnight for that institution—not just in Australia but also in its homeland of Britain. Time is up for the British monarchy. The British Scout Association has registered its dissatisfaction. How could it be in Australia that those bastions of conservative views, the Liberal and National parties, could support the monarchy at a time when the British Scout Association cannot?

         It is no longer possible to defend the royal family. How can they remain at the head of our constitution? If the tories in Britain have given up defending the indefensible, surely the tories in Australia should concede that time is up for the monarch as Australia's head of state. There has, however, been a change of opinion among the tories and the Liberal Party in this country. I have followed with some amount of interest the public comments of the youngest of young fogies, the most conservative of the conservatives, the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott). Just last year he regarded Prince Charles as a man of `international star quality'. I am not too sure what sort of stardom he was alluding to. It could not have been the Hugh Grant variety, but that was the comment from the member for Warringah just 12 months ago.

        I would have thought the case is self-evident. If the tories in this country can no longer defend the British monarchy, if they can no longer defend the house of Windsor, how can they maintain an argument that the Australian head of state should be a British monarch? How is it that they can deny the strength of the argument that Australia's head of state should be an Australian citizen; that Australia's head of state should be one of us?

         The argument is totally sound and beyond doubt.

         —The debate on the republic this afternoon and earlier has ranged far and wide, as it should. It is a debate that occurred 100 years ago. The debate about Australia becoming a republic was quite prominent in the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s and many famous Australians—perhaps most notably, Henry Lawson—were strong advocates for creating a genuinely independent country in the South Pacific.

         I remember hearing the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) allude to his childhood and the mores under which he grew up. I can still remember very well the old empire days—perhaps, I am one of the older members of this House. I always used to find it quite ironic that on maps of the world the empire was always pink when the British flag was red, white and blue. They could not use red because that was the colour of communism, so they had this strange pink colour. I always thought pink was for girls—the old `pink for girls and blue for boys'—so I thought it was ironic that the British empire saw itself as effeminate. That was always my interpretation—probably an unfair one, but in those days things were very black and white.

I did my major in English, particularly in literature, and was one of those people who travelled overland from Calcutta to London in 1968. I spent 7 1/2 months travelling looking at parts of the ex-empire, if you like, visiting India, Nepal, Pakistan—I never quite made it to Afghanistan, but I saw a lot of graves of British soldiers in the Khyber Pass—Iran, Greece and Europe. India did not seem to have suffered by not having the Queen of England as its monarch. I was puzzled by that because I thought we were more advanced than India was. Supposedly, we were. I had been taught that we were. Yet, India had its own president and we still had the Queen as our head of state.

         When I worked in the UK for 1 1/2 years or more, my work mates constantly made remarks about Australia.

Robin Day said, `It has been obvious, Mr Anthony, that for many years we have been going our own way and our future is in Europe. Obviously we can't have you with us in Europe. We have to move that way. Haven't you understood that? Why hasn't Australia made appropriate adjustments?' Mr Anthony's response was, `We never thought you'd let us down.'

         The approach was a very simplistic one. We were effectively part of the empire—the empire which would never have let the sun set on it, the mother country which would never have let us down—so we would not need to adjust as a country. That was in 1969. I copped heaps at work for days afterwards. Every day I was harassed by colleagues about our representative. I consolidated my views very strongly at that stage in terms of the direction, the calibre and the depth of understanding of Australian politics of that era.

         People say, `So what? Who cares what people overseas think?' It is an easy way out to say that we should make our own decisions and who cares what other people think. The fact is what other people think shapes what happens. In this particular situation, perceptions are fundamentally important. If the world perceives that we want someone else to reign over us, that we think England would never let us down, that we are part of some immortal empire and structure long beyond its meaningful existence, it will not judge us well and will respond to us accordingly. The world responds to us largely as though we are a colony of Britain because that is what we project.

         The role of head of state in Australia has a number of functions. In this recent debate, people are starting to think through what that really means. We see it as being ceremonial, and that is an important role. It is important that the nation does have ceremonies. It is important that the nation does have symbols and traditions. But it is also important that it builds on those and consolidates them.

The fact that it was a gift was very important to us as a nation and as a parliament. We should treasure and respect that. But the fact is the symbols it carries are symbols of Europe.

         Having gone to the effort and had the maturity to establish an Australian parliament with its own colours and ambience, it was suggested that we should not import into that the visions, the pictorials or the symbols, if you like, of another country.

         What we have done in this parliament is build on the traditions that we inherited from Great Britain. We inherited the Westminster system and we have built on it and Australianised it.

         The role of the head of state will be largely ceremonial. That is a fundamentally important role. The head of state will also have a promotional role. When that person travels he or she will do so as a true head of state, not as a representative of a head of state. Parliamentarians in Asia have often said that we do not promote our country well enough and that we rely on our business people to be the sole promoters.

         One important role which we do not do so well at the moment is that of a fountain of wisdom. In my opinion, the head of state should reflect back to the community. I can recall the role Sir Ninian Stephen played in handing over Uluru, or Ayers Rock as it was called, to the Aboriginal people. That ceremony was wonderfully moving. His performance and the role he played at that ceremony were fundamentally important to the development of reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. I think he showed that the role of a potential head of state could be one of profound wisdom. He also showed that that person could feed back into our community and our society some sense of leadership in relation to matters other than government and politics.

         That is why the way the head of state is chosen and the methodology used to choose that person are very important. I find it quite ludicrous that people argue the current system should be maintained when, under the current system, the Governor-General is simply appointed by the Prime Minister not by the parliament. On the one hand we are being told that the head of state is Australian and that we should not worry about that person only being representative. Then on the other hand we endorse the fact that the head of state is appointed by the Prime Minister. So the idea that those are compatible seems very contradictory.

         The potential of having a genuine head of state who is Australian gives us the opportunity to shift our understanding of how our government and social systems can work. But the idea of having an election to decide the head of state is worrying. I note from the speeches of those opposite that many people share the same concerns.

At the end of all that, it would be an absolute shemozzle. That is a fundamentally important reason why we cannot do it that way and why that is not an appropriate method.

         The second point that has often been raised relates to the American example of gridlock, where you have two mandates—the parliamentary mandate and the presidential mandate. Those who have watched the American system would not wish to replicate it here, even though they do have checks and balances and different roles. But the fact is that any elected president or head of state would have a substantial mandate of political power.

For all those structural reasons, the idea of a popular election for a head of state is not all that appealing in a practical sense.

         I am mindful that the community at large sees the election of a head of state as an important issue. I can understand that, certainly in the current climate, with the disillusionment with politics here and worldwide. For example, in America and most of Europe when things are hard and when economies are not running well with high unemployment, it is not surprising and it is understandable that people have some degree of disillusionment. In that context, an election for a head of state gives people a certain sense of extra power. It is an empowering process and I understand and appreciate that.

         When I speak to people and work through what is involved, they tend to recognise that even though it may be a nice idea, when we think about it, it probably creates much more problems than it addresses. It has been fairly unfortunate that in recent months those who have opposed the establishment of a republic have used this particular angle to try to diminish and demean the arguments. They have used the device of disenchantment, and therefore the natural appeal of a popular election, as a vehicle to diminish and argue against the republic overall.

         Times have changed since the last century when the Commonwealth was being established and our current constitution was written. During the 1960s England went into the Common Market quite openly, validly, honestly and appropriately. Times have changed and we have severed most of our formal legal links with England, yet our relationship has never been better. Quite frankly, in the 1960s, before I went overseas, I can recall the resentment in Australia about the fact that we could buy butter cheaper in England than we could in Australia. I can recall the cost of goods in the UK and the amount of subsidisation and cross-trade activities between England, Europe and Australia.

         I think our relationship is much healthier now. It is a relationship of two mature countries that cooperate and have a very common basis, a common language and a lot of cultural overlaps. The fact is that we are diverging. Our path is going in a different direction from that of Britain because we are in different parts of the world and we have different forces driving us. I think part of those forces is an urge for self-determination for this country.

         We can never truly talk about being a sovereign country while we have somebody's monarch as our head of state. The arguments being put forward in the paper are compelling and it behoves all of us to talk to our communities and to explain what it actually means—to get away from the hype, the nonsense and the exaggeration and get down to the actual fundamentals. This change would help our trade pattern. The surge of activity that would flow from an act of self-determination would be important.

         In a similar way, our attractiveness as a country to invest in would be enhanced if people saw that we were a bit more self-determining ourselves and that we wanted to be sovereign. Quite frankly, this pawing back constantly from sovereign status must undermine our standing in the world, including the investment world. One can understand an apprehension about investing in a country that does not want to stand on its own two feet and that wants to always somehow share a monarch with somebody else. That is not a sign of a mature country and is not a sign of a country with a strong future, both of which I am sure we are and have. So an act of self-determination would have an effect on our trade patterns and have an effect on our domestic economy and our employment situation.

It started a few hundred years ago. It has been going on for a couple of hundred years already. I think it is now coming to an end. With those words, I commend the paper to the House.

         —by leave—We have the opportunity to have this debate because the numerous amendments to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill that have been moved in the Senate have not yet come back for the House to debate. There is a rumour sweeping the parliament that the amendments have gone to the printers but, because of the very high current account deficit today, the printer is insisting that the cheque be cashed first and there is some difficulty with the government raising the money. No doubt it is melting down some of the gold reserves to pay it and we may have to wait for some time.

         I appreciate the opportunity to continue this debate. As I said yesterday, it is ironic that we are debating something like the republic when there are things far more serious going on in this country—today a current account deficit in excess of $2.9 billion, greater than Mexico's, and the government has this sort of priority. In my electorate probably the most immediate issue of concern is the drought. Hopefully we are coming out of it in some of the areas, but people are desperate to get some help from the government and it has been very tardy in coming.

         While the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Bob Collins, on 29 May extended the drought assistance by $43.3 million, which was very welcome indeed—a decision based on RASAC's advice—it still does not seem to have gone into the correct areas. If we take the Nyngan Rural Lands Protection Board, for example, divisions B, C and D were declared eligible for exceptional circumstances assistance. But there was no declaration in division A, which is probably not only the worst division of all, as far as being affected by the drought is concerned, but, I would venture to say, is probably the most severely affected area in the whole of my electorate. There are 50 federal electorates in New South Wales, which is a geographic average of two per cent. My electorate covers 40 per cent of New South Wales because of the remoteness of that area. Division A of Nyngan has missed out, which is tragic indeed.

         —It will not help them at all. Not one cent has been forthcoming for these people in desperate positions who are, in some cases, surviving on food parcels. Even if we take an area to the south of there, we see that in Dubbo divisions A and D have been included, but division B has been left out. The north of that division has been devastated by the drought and it is hard to understand these decisions indeed.

         The Cobar Rural Lands Protection Board is not worried about whether we are debating a republic or a monarchy. It is desperate for assistance, too. Condobolin has not had one cent of assistance in this regard. The Wilcannia and Broken Hill rural lands protection boards have also missed out. I had correspondence from the Elliotts at Yelta at Wilcannia. They are a very hardworking and honest farming family. There are four or five properties in that area that have been devastated by the drought. The government may say, `What are four or five properties?' Four or five properties cover an area much bigger than most electorates in Australia. It would be pleasing indeed if the minister would give some consideration to these people.

         While the assistance on 29 May was very welcome indeed, it was very late in coming. It was insufficient, as I have said, and it has overlooked some of the worst hit areas of all. If nothing else, it indicates the inadequacy of the criteria that are being used to determine what areas are in and what areas are not in. It is in total conflict with the recommendations of the New South Wales department of agriculture—under a Labor government in New South Wales—which has clearly said that these areas should be included. So I do not know how the minister can make the decisions that he has.

         After the last announcements were made, he shot off to America, no doubt for important business. But the people who were lucky enough to get certificates that would have allowed the assistance to flow through to them had to wait for three or four weeks. It may not seem much to the government, but three or four weeks for these people without this sort of welfare assistance to allow them to put bread on their table for their spouses and their children is very important indeed.

         RASAC, as I have mentioned, advised the minister on what areas should go in. While I am reluctant to criticise RASAC, quite frankly, I think the advice it is giving is bad. I cannot see that it has made any property visits to these areas before the advice has been forthcoming. We are talking about very large areas indeed that are being considered. I do not know of the RASAC people having set foot on one property on an official drought inspection. I know they have gone to Mudgee and I know they have gone to Dubbo. But when they went to Mudgee they flew into the airport, got into cars, went to the RSL club, held a meeting there and went back to the airport. When they came to Dubbo I am told they did the same thing. They never actually made one official drought property inspection. Lines have been drawn on maps in the comfort of distant offices without even the courtesy of listening to the farmers or listening to the experts or the local people in these areas having been extended.

         To my knowledge, Minister Collins is yet to make an official visit to a drought affected property in New South Wales. I may be wrong on that; he is purely basing his decisions on bureaucratic advice. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has not yet made one official drought visit in New South Wales. The new Labor Premier of New South Wales, to his credit, did. He came to Dubbo and went out to Eumungerie and the Gilgandra area. He said that he knew nothing about the land. To his credit he made that admission. Within 10 minutes he could see what had to be done. He has made the right recommendations, or substantially so. But, federally, this advice so far has been all but totally ignored.

         We have just come through one of the most severe droughts in the history of this country. While it has been going on, the costs of running farms have continued to rise. Throughout that we have had things like the wool collapse and so on and commodity prices have been down. If we take the A division of the Nyngan Rural Lands Protection Board, we see that there are only 120 farmers in the division. I do not know what number would qualify to go onto exceptional circumstance assistance, but it would probably be only 40, 50 or 60. So it would not trouble the purse that much at all. Molong division A went in and, to my knowledge, it did not even ask to go in. It is interesting, though, that there are 370 farmers in that particular division and I am told that not one of those farmers employs a full-time employee now.
