              <span class="HPS-Small">A call to the Australian Government to end its complicity in the ongoing genocide in Palestine and impose trade and arms sanctions against Israel. On April 4th 2024, Israel deliberately killed aid workers leading to multiple aid organisations and charities to cease operations in Gaza. Since October 9th 2023, Gaza has been under a total blockade of food, fuel, electricity and water. The people of Gaza are already on the brink of starvation and urgently need international intervention to pressure Israel into ending its blockade and allow the unimpeded entry of aid into Gaza to prevent this man-made famine. We call on the Australian government to join its allies such as Canada, Netherlands, Japan, Spain and Belgium to impose trade and arm sanctions on Israel and to pressure Israel to end its ongoing genocide in Gaza.</span>

This is unfair on the customer and is adding to the real price gouging of items. As our banks have reported multi billion dollar profits in recent months they should be forced by Act of Parliament to absorb card payment costs or be banned from charging these fees. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently pending charges appear on nationally coordinated police checks. This is, by its very nature, prejudicial. The backbone of our legal system is that any given person is presumed innocent until proven otherwise, beyond any shadow of a doubt. Having pending charges on a police check is prohibitive of gaining employment. The court system is extremely backlogged, with estimations of trial dates being given a year or more ahead of time means that an accused that is released on bail, for the entire time they are on bail are unable to, or extremely unlikely to be offered a job if that employer asks for a police check during the recruitment process, which is about 95% of job offerings. Not being able to work and support oneself while going through what is likely one of the most harrowing experiences an individual can have, has catastrophic and often tragic results. An accused that has been released on bail, has already been deemed by a magistrate to not be a threat to the public by the very virtue of being granted bail in the first place. We claim that an accused individual is presumed innocent, so why are we punishing individuals that have not been found guilty of committing a crime and are innocent according to law? A pending charge is not a conviction. A pending charge does not mean guilt. A pending charge welcomes discrimination.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We, the undersigned, petition the Parliament of Australia to address the urgent and dire conditions faced by Australian Defence Force (ADF) veterans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">ADF veterans encounter significant challenges upon returning to civilian life, including homelessness, high rates of suicide, and protracted battles to have injuries recognised for treatment and compensation. Unlike civilian counterparts, the military lacks a comprehensive work cover system, leaving veterans vulnerable upon discharge.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Moreover, the process of accessing medical support post-discharge is excessively bureaucratic and time-consuming, with veterans waiting up to three years to be accepted for white or gold cards. These cards, designed for medical treatment costs, merely serve as a gateway to further assessments for medical compensation, prolonging veterans' suffering and exacerbating mental health issues.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to take decisive action to alleviate the burdens faced by ADF veterans by abolishing the white and gold card system altogether. Instead, we advocate for free access to medical care for veterans as a fundamental right for their service to the nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">By removing financial barriers to medical treatment, veterans can receive timely and comprehensive care, thereby improving their overall well-being and reducing the mental health toll imposed by navigating bureaucratic obstacles for essential services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We call upon the Parliament to prioritise the welfare of our ADF veterans by implementing this critical reform without delay.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The powers of the eSafety Commission, conferred by the Online Safety Act 2021, are so broad as to threaten Australian democracy and the liberty of all Australians. Democracy cannot function without free expression, including the right to speak, be heard, and to seek out information unimpeded. The eSafety Commission's powers can and have been used to interfere with that critical democratic function.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">It does not take a tyrant to remove the liberty of a people, only a small group of well-meaning people committed to the righteousness of their cause. The eSafety Commission's powers are vulnerable to influence by such a group. Arguably, they already have been, with criticism of transgenderism being suppressed on multiple occasions on order of the eSafety Commission. What else has been suppressed?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The powers of the eSafety Commission are so broad as to be vulnerable to ideological capture by a small but fervent minority. This is unacceptable. The risk of a harm to all Australians, present and future, by restricting free expression must be balanced against the risk of local harm to individuals from objectionable or even harmful speech. The Online Safety Act 2021 and the powers conferred on the eSafety Commission do not acceptably balance those risks.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to repeal the Online Safety Act 2021 and limit the power of the Australian government to restrict Australian's free expression, including the right to speak, be heard, and seek out information unimpeded, in order to safeguard Australian democracy and the liberty of all Australians.</span>

It is crucial to make evidence-based therapies accessible to all, irrespective of financial circumstances.

It was an off-the shelf pharmaceutical product that was very useful for a group of patients with decreased rectal sensitivity, slow bowel transit and increased gut sensitivity. It is very different to other laxatives as it has dual functions (bulking agent and stimulant) and it is also in the low FODMAP group which means it is suitable for most patients with a sensitive gut and food intolerance. </span>

This was a very important pharmaceutical product for our patient group and since its withdrawal, it has caused much distress and anxiety to our patient group. To gut-focused specialists and health professionals, Normacol Plus was considered to be an important pharmaceutical product, like any other medication in Australia.

              <span class="HPS-Small">New Chief of Defence David Johnston has a task ahead to restore the confidence of all Australians, as we have become a tool of American capitalist dominance at the cost of our own self determination. The 2022 move to develop nuclear weapon storage facilities is a move toward NATO style degradation of diplomacy that pits Australia against its most significant diplomatic and trading partners for the benefit of American economy and is an abuse of the Non-proliferation of Nuclear weapons Treaty. US trade and defence deals are shrouded in secrecy and are undermining Australia's ability of self determination. in 2019, Trump scrapped the TPP, then the US/China Trade deal allowed China to be blamed for transferring barley, wine and fresh produce to USA from other importers (ie Australia). Admiral Reid recently highlighted Australia will not be responsible for the operation of AUKUS submarines, nor is Australian manufacture part of current agreements. America's recent non-diplomacy, supporting prolonged IDF onslaught to enable trade from India through Pakistan to Israeli ports has been an alerting example of this diplomatic decay. Australia does have an interest in the welfare and well being of American citizens, but not at the cost of our own self determination, as this is the cascade effect of storing nuclear weapons. This has been raised in petitions since 2010, but this year, has become critically crystal clear.</span>

This project is too important to leave to state planners.

Our National Plan is not working and the rates of FDV homicide, rates of sexual violence and drivers of domestic and gendered violence are clearly not understood by Government. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We demand a National Royal Commission into the drivers of gendered violence, including the abject failure to see children as victims of domestic abuse and a focus on perpetrator consequences, accountability, rehabilitation and prevention.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The 6 monthly, inflation linked excise rises on fuel and alcohol artificially inflates the price of described goods and is itself inflationary. Furthermore, when there is a period of negative inflation, the excise does not decrease in line with the negative inflation. The 6 monthly excise rise on alcohol in particular has an extremely detrimental effect on small craft breweries, and the live music industry. The excise rises are independent of the actual price of the goods themselves and are based on the overall inflation rate of the economy, resulting in the excise as a percentage of the goods gradually increasing over time.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This will cause serious financial and emotional harm to thousands of international students who are already in Australia studying, expecting they will have access to a working visa when they finish their studies. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Many students have planned and counted on gaining this postgraduate working visa for many varied reasons. For many, it is an essential requirement to gain their skill assessments for migration purposes, for others who need Australian work experience to gain specific licences, and for others who depend on gaining meaningful Australian work experience.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is not the right way to treat our international visitors who contribute significantly to our economy.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These law changes will not only crush the dreams and hopes of the people we wanted to attract to Australia. It also creates a reputation for Australia that you cannot trust what the Australian government offers to international students.</span>

Whenever their course is completed, this transition arrangement should remain in effect.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">There are homeless children with significant substance-abuse issues everywhere in Australia. We need to give the courts and hospitals the power to safely contain, detox and help these children with their drug and mental health problems. Currently the cycle continues long into adulthood and often results in the death of the young person, or even worse, the death of innocent bystanders.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our courts NEED powers to make orders for mandatory residential drug treatment. There are so many young people nowadays that are damaged and vulnerable, they don't engage with voluntary programs, and therefore don't receive any treatment whatsoever.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On the 8th of May, 2024, it was announced that the Astrazeneca COVID19 vaccine has been withdrawn globally due to it causing fatal blood clots and low platelet counts. Indeed, a new disease came into existence due to their vaccination, known as Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Many Australians, myself included, were coerced to take said vaccine, even though a majority of Australian's then went on to quickly come down with the disease they were vaccinated against.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It's not acceptable that in a supposedly free country, citizens would be coerced into taking something that could result in their death. This coercion came via threat of livelihood, inability to access service: Vacs, inability to see family members in nursing homes. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We were assured that these vaccines were safe and effective, yet we now know that they were neither. Those who refused such had their lives ruined, with bureaucrats encouraging isolation and stigmatisation of the unvaccinated. I still can't regain my former job in health care due to my vaccination status.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to 1: apologise for ever allowing mandates to occur. 2. Apologise for mandating a product which has now been globally withdrawn due to abovementioned risk of death. 3. Ensure that in a free country, informed consent free of coercion is reinforced for whatever the future holds. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is firmly committed to taking action on climate change.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government has legislated targets to reduce Australia's emissions by 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 and committed over $40 billion to decarbonising our domestic economy. Current emissions projections, based on implementation of policies such as the reformed Safeguard Mechanism and the expanded Capacity Investment Scheme show that Australia is in striking distance of the 2030 target. The government is also committed to transforming Australia's electricity system to achieve its goal of82 per cent renewables by 2030.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a trusted source of scientific advice, and its work continues to inform the government. The recent IPCC Sixth Assessment Report provides an update on the latest climate science, and options for mitigating and adapting to climate change. In this report, the IPCC concluded that all proposed forms of climate geoengineering are 'speculative technologies' (section 1.4.3 of www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/chapter/chapter-1/), and that there are no available technologies that could be used to affect the global climate (section 4.6.3 of www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-40.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a party to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, Australia has agreed to restrict all climate geoengineering, including SRM, unless it is for small-scale scientific research or unless the risks and scientific basis are appropriately considered (Decision X/33, 2010).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, in October 2023, the government successfully secured a decision under the <span style="font-style:italic;">United Nations Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer </span>for researchers to consider risks and uncertainties for the ozone layer in any scientific studies or assessments related to high-altitude climate geoengineering (stratospheric aerosol injection), where small particles are released high in the atmosphere to reduce solar radiation and warming (Decision XXXV/4, 2023). Under this decision, member countries will also be provided updates on developments in stratospheric aerosol injection to assist with understanding of the potential impacts of this technology on the ozone layer.</span>

                <span style="font-style:italic;">
                </span>Currently, Australia does not have a specific domestic regulatory framework for geoengineering activities. There is however legislation at the national and state level that provides protection for the environment against unacceptable environmental impacts of all types of activities. This includes the Commonwealth <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act I999 </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Great Barrier Reef</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Marine Park Act I975.</span></span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the government's commitment to protecting the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, the government is currently funding one research project into SRM. Climate change is the biggest threat to the Reef, and many World Heritage sites globally. The Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program {RRAP) is investigating the use of marine cloud brightening, where salt from sea water is sprayed into the air to help form clouds, to prevent or reduce localised bleaching stress on coral reefs by reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the Reef. More information on this program is available on the RRAP website at gbrrestoration.org/program/ cooling-and-shading/.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is in the middle of a housing crisis, with the costs associated with finding and maintaining a home growing faster than wages. Rental vacancies are at all-time lows, with 169,000 households on public housing waiting lists and another 122,000 people experiencing homelessness. Meanwhile, projected housing supply remains low and growing numbers of individuals and families are sleeping on the street or in their cars or living in tents. I hear consistently from my community that housing challenges are literally keeping them awake at night.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It isn't just the ability to afford a home that is affecting people but the security of tenure, proximity to jobs and concerns about whether their children and elderly parents will have long-term appropriate housing. Older residents looking to downsize tell me that they're simply unable to find an affordable apartment in their community that would leave them with enough cash to live on. Perversely, this means younger families can't find the family homes they want as older Australians struggle to leave them. I hear from nurses, teachers and firefighters who are faced with the decision of whether to spend two-thirds of their income on rent or to commute over 30 kilometres each way every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard from people experiencing homelessness and the threat of homelessness, from forced couch surfing to overcrowding, insecure housing and street homelessness. The messages are the same. In every circumstance, the conversations take my breath away. At its heart, the concept of a home is so much more than just shelter. It is security, self-expression, relationships and family. Every human being has a fundamental right to be able to live in a safe environment. The very idea of homeownership is embedded in the Australian culture, yet we're now seeing generations of Australians who, despite their best efforts and hard work, can only dream of achieving the cultural milestone of homeownership and for whom this rite of passage is a roll of the dice, increasingly dependent on family financial assistance. Australia's housing crisis, however, has been a long time in the making. It is a multidimensional and complex issue with diverse causes and broad effects. That is why a strong, ambitious, overarching framework is so sorely needed—one that gives coherence to the national initiatives delivered since the 2022 election and sets a road map for long-term housing reform. This bill does just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I speak to the specifics of the bill, I want to thank Senator Pocock and his team for leading this work. Senator Pocock is today introducing this same bill through the Senate, and I'm proud to join him in introducing it to the House of Representatives, for, more than any other time in our parliament's history, we must be prepared to set politics aside and work together, party with party, house with house, to truly turn the tide. I also thank the member for Indi, who is seconding the bill, for her fearless work in fighting for improved outcomes for regional Australians. Finally, I thank Professor Hal Paulson and Dr Chris Martin for their thoughtful leadership and tireless efforts to make Australian housing policy better. Together with a broad range of expert stakeholders and drafters, they have given life to this bill, which will improve the governance and accountability of national housing policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For, you see, this bill sets out processes to develop, implement and maintain a national housing and homelessness plan aimed at facilitating a human rights based approach to housing. It draws inspiration from Canada's National Housing Strategy Act of 2019, which recognises housing as a fundamental human right. And it is founded on Australia's international obligations to realise the human right to adequate housing and uses the Commonwealth government's constitutional authority on external affairs to pursue this obligation. Importantly, while this bill sets out objectives and goals for the plan, it deliberately does not prescribe specific policies and programs. Rather, the government of the day would be responsible for its own plan, but the housing minister under this bill would be required to periodically report to parliament on progress and to revise and renew their plan as appropriate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also establishes the National Housing Consumer Council to ensure the perspectives of both tenants and homebuyers are provided directly to the housing minister, alongside the expert perspectives of the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council. It also establishes the National Housing and Homelessness Advocate to report independently on systemic issues and the progress of the plan. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this bill has strong support, with the proposal to legislate a national housing and homelessness plan recently backed by over a hundred individuals and organisations, including leading academics, industry experts, economists, peak bodies and advocates and both past and present politicians from across the spectrum. These individuals and organisations are working on the ground to help alleviate homelessness. They are the organisations that support domestic violence victims to find safe and secure housing. They are the academic institutions tasked with finding policy solutions to Australia's housing crisis, and they are the human rights experts. And they all support the call for a legislated national housing and homelessness plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to recognise that the current government is striving to improve housing in this country and to thank them for that. But, to move forward in a consistent and constructive fashion, we must provide a collective understanding of the rules in this game, and we must put human rights at the centre of our ambitions. Earlier this year, I convened the North Sydney Community Housing Forum, a successful exercise in deliberative democracy that brought 30 ordinary people from across my community together to determine ways to improve housing affordability. The resounding message from that forum was, when it comes to housing policy, they want leadership, direction, long-term thinking and optimism. And that's what this bill does. It sets an overarching framework that I've heard my community wants. It provides a road map that puts human rights at the centre of all future federal housing policy, regardless of the government of the day, and it repositions homes from being seen as assets and returns them to their rightful location as homes where families grow and people age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I call on the government to recognise this need and allow the bill to be brought to debate. I commend this bill to the House and cede the remainder of my time to the member for Indi.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  I rise to second the National Housing and Homelessness Plan Bill 2024. I do so with great pride to back the member for North Sydney and Senator Pocock on this extremely important legislation, which establishes that housing is a human right. That is not said often enough in this place. It's a right that all Australians, no matter their address, no matter their income, no matter their living situation, have somewhere to call home. It is absolutely fundamental to our dignity and to our physical and mental wellbeing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As parliamentarians, we have a responsibility to do everything we can to ensure that all Australians have a place to call home, because the housing crisis gripping Australia and indeed much of the world is undermining so many people's right to an adequate standard of living. Across regional, rural and remote Australia people are struggling. Sky-high interest rates and declining rental availability are making it so hard for people to find a home. In my electorate of Indi, housing is more expensive and less accessible than at any other point in our lifetimes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I visit towns across my electorate I hear of people in townhouses being pushed into units. Those in units are being pushed into caravan parks, and those who were in the caravan parks are being pushed into tents alongside the rivers. Homelessness is at a level that I have not seen in the 35 years that I've lived in north-east Victoria. It's why I introduced my unlocking regional Australia housing bill in 2023, which would have ensured that a fair share of the government's investment in housing went to the regions. It's why I'm calling on this government to create a regional housing infrastructure fund to ensure that we can fund the critical enabling infrastructure that opens the land to allow houses to be built. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government must do everything it can and use every tool at its disposal to address this crisis, and it's why I am proud to support this bill. Crucially, it will be recognised in legislation that housing is a human right and one that this parliament has an obligation to fulfil. The bill would also require the government of the day to prepare a national housing and homelessness plan to set out to the Australian people how it plans to ensure that everyone has somewhere to call home, somewhere to sleep at night and somewhere to be safe. Under this bill this plan would set out a 10-year road map to coordinate funding and program delivery across all levels of government. In a policy area as complex as housing, it is so important for the government to set a long-term strategic vision, irrespective of who is in government—and only the Commonwealth can provide that leadership. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A similar plan in Canada, which has a federal system just like ours, is already showing results in helping to coordinate action between different levels of government. As the member for North Sydney said, it is vital that we embed this plan in legislation to ensure no government can shirk its responsibilities to plan for a housing system that works for all of us. To establish the National Housing and Homelessness Plan in legislation would enhance its credibility. It would give us a yardstick by which to measure the government's performance. In addition, this bill would establish a national housing consumer council to ensure that the voices of those who live in their homes, the renters, the homebuyers, the retirees—the voices we never hear—are heard. The consumer council will ensure that their needs are reflected in policymaking. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is common sense. We should recognise housing as a right. We should get on and do it, and we should do it now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to speak on behalf of the people of Mackellar and millions of other ordinary Australians across the country to express their deep concern about the state of Australia's environment, and, in particular, their dismay at the government's decision to delay its promised overhaul of our national environment laws: the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report contained many alarming facts, including that more mammal species have become extinct in Australia than on any other continent, that Australia continues to have one of the highest rates of species decline amongst OECD countries, that there are now more foreign plant species in Australia than native species, that at least 19 Australian ecosystems have been reported as showing signs of collapse or near collapse, and that 7.7 million hectares of habitat for threatened species was cleared or substantially degraded between 2000 and 2017. It made for truly sobering reading and clearly demonstrated that our current environment laws are way too weak and that enforcement of these weak laws is ineffective. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Six months after releasing the report—over 18 months ago now—the Minister for the Environment and Water stated that Australia's environment laws are broken and nature is being destroyed. She said, </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the most crucial part of those reforms—the strengthening and reforming of the laws that actually protect our environment—has been postponed. It has been kicked down the road. Yes, we understand that these reforms are complex, but they are also extremely urgent. These reforms have been relegated to stage 3, and no timeline has been set for these substantive reforms to be enacted. It seems increasingly likely that they will not be introduced prior to the next election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a positive that this week we will be debating stage 2 of the environment reforms, including the government's plan to establish an environment protection agency and an environment information agency. The new EPA will have stronger enforcement powers and penalties, which is good news. However, it is hard to see how it can protect our environment when it will be administering the very same laws the minister described, just 18 months ago, as 'broken'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A key weakness of the EPBC Act is that it contains major exemptions for certain activities, such as native forest logging and land clearing for agriculture, so that these activities can proceed without having to be assessed for their environmental impacts under the act. The regional forestry agreement exemption, for example, means that even when logging projects are to occur in critical habitat for threatened species they still don't need to be assessed under the EPBC Act for unacceptable impacts. In light of the extreme state of environmental degradation, the RFA exemption is anachronistic and, as Professor Samuel, author of the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the environment</span> report, said in the recent Senate hearing: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We ought to get rid of those RFAs. They should never have been introduced in the first place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other egregious flaw in the EPBC Act is the continuous use exemption, which permits land users to clear old regrowth, even in the habitat of threatened or migratory species. It is being used as a loophole by farmers to undertake far more intensive and extensive land clearing. In just one example, last year more than 670 hectares of land was bulldozed near Gladstone in Queensland. The land was cleared for beef pasture, but it is within an area mapped as habitat for 37 EPBC-listed threatened species, including the koala, the northern quoll and the greater glider. This type of destruction of critical habitat for threatened species is permissible under our current, weak national environment laws. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These egregious exemptions need to be repealed immediately, not at some unspecified time in the future that may or may not ever happen. We call on the government to honour its promises by repealing the RFA and continuous use exemptions, now, in stage 2. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:20</span>):  I'm glad to speak to this motion, and I thank the member for Mackellar for bringing it forward for debate. I say at the outset that we're not delaying this critical area of reform; we've begun to deliver on it already. We'll do more of that this week, and we'll keep going on that path until the job is done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Mackellar says, the basic situation with respect to Australia's environment is not hard to understand. It's not a heartening story that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> environment</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2021</span> report found our environment is poor and deteriorating. The previous government hid that report out of embarrassment at their inaction. In 2020 Professor Graeme Samuel produced his independent review of the EPBC Act and found that Australia's natural environment and iconic places are in an overall state of decline and are under increasing threat. What did the coalition government do in response to that report? Sadly, nothing. So we come to government under no illusion that our country's environment and biodiversity have undergone significant harm and are facing extraordinary pressures—especially now, through climate change—and we're responding to that crisis which was utterly neglected for a decade by a coalition government that slashed funding to the environment department by 40 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Mackellar acknowledges, it's a large and complex task. But it is urgent, and the Minister for the Environment and Water has acted on the basis there is no time to waste. That's why we have pushed out the environmental protection effort in every direction, getting on with the larger regulatory reform task while at the same time pushing ahead immediately with a number of restorative measures. Indeed, in the first two years of the Albanese Labor government we've tripled the size of the Macquarie Island Marine Park, adding a protected marine zone larger than the size of Germany. We've kicked off the $200 million Urban Rivers and Catchments Program. We've made the global 30 by 30 commitment, and we'll conserve, separately, 30 per cent of our land and marine territory by 2030. We've joined the High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution. We've expanded our Antarctic science program. We're investing $23 million over the next year to develop a new national circular economy framework, and we've provided $224.5 million over the next four years through the Saving Native Species Program to support the recovery of our unique plants, animals and ecological communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've done those things while working steadily to achieve EPBC reform—the first instalment of which we delivered as quickly as possible last year, with an expanded and strengthened water trigger as promised. Now we're delivering the next stage of the nature positive reforms, with the creation of Australia's first independent environmental protection agency—a long-awaited and massive reform—and, alongside that, the critically important new function of Environment Information Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long we simply haven't been able to see clearly the joined-up picture of Australia's environmental condition and biodiversity. That's resulted in a piecemeal approach to assessing impact, which has put our environment on the path to death by a thousand cuts. We cannot allow that to continue, and that's why we're implementing the recommendations of the Samuel review to significantly update Australia's national environmental laws. It's important to recognise that the approach we're taking to deliver that reform is endorsed by Graeme Samuel himself; it's important for people to recognise that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current EPBC Act is more than 1,000 pages long, and the complexity of the reform task is considerable. The consultation process to date has been broad, searching and extensive. While I've heard from lots of people who understandably want this reform completed as quickly as possible, I've also heard from lots of community members and, indeed, environmental stakeholders who keep insisting, quite rightly, that consultation cannot be rushed. This reform cannot be rushed. That kind of balance between rapid reform towards a much-needed change and proper consultative engagement that delivers high-quality and lasting reform is precisely the challenge of good government. I say with great respect to the member for Mackellar that it's often been the case with members of the crossbench that one day we'll hear things aren't being done quickly enough and the next day we'll hear things are being too done too quickly. That's politics, I guess; certainly it's convenient if you want to create the impression from time to time that there's something not quite right about the government, which—hallelujah—the crossbench is always here to help us correct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the strength of logic that is driving the call on us, the Australian government, from the broader Australian community to make some stark and substantial changes as quickly and as resolutely as can be done. That has always been a huge focus of my work. People should know that in Tanya Plibersek, the member for Sydney, they have a minister for the environment who is absolutely committed and absolutely indefatigable in her application to that task.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, let me say clearly that, contrary to the terms of this motion, we have not resiled from anything. The Australian environment desperately needs a period of stable, sustained reform in government—an Albanese Labor government.</span>

The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the environment </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2021</span> report pulled back the curtain on the devastating damage that is being done to our environment. We have the highest rate of deforestation in the developed world. We have the highest rate of animal extinction of any country, and we are doing irreparable damage to the Great Barrier Reef. Threatened species have been declining between two per cent and three per cent per year since 2000, meaning we have seen a 60 per cent decline in Australia's threatened species index in the past two decades. Add to this the existential threat posed by climate pollution, and our environment has never been in greater danger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our failure to address the decline is in no small part due to our broken environmental laws. The EPBC Act was introduced under John Howard a quarter of a century ago, and the laws are still stuck in the past. They don't protect the environment, and, frankly, they don't work for business either, who are tied up in a slow and process driven approach to environmental approvals. The minister has rightly acknowledged the need for reform, and I know she is sincere in her commitment to achieve this, but, more than two years into parliament, we don't have any legislation to address the fundamental flaws in our national environmental law. There are numerous parts of this law that require reform, so I am going to focus my comments on two, including identifying things the government could move on now, even without a full review of the EPBC Act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, we need to end the exemption of regional forest agreements, which allow destructive native forest logging to continue unchecked. Native forest logging causes huge environmental damage across the country, affecting over 250 threatened species the past two decades in southern New South Wales alone. The destruction of koala habitat that's permitted in these exemptions in our national environment law is mostly to make low-value products like paper pulp, which we could get from plantations instead. As well as the environmental damage, native forest logging destroys an incredibly powerful carbon sink, so much so that experts estimate stopping native forest logging in southern New South Wales would be the state's largest carbon-abatement project. At a time when we're fighting to meet our targets, this seems absolutely so obvious. It would also be good for a New South Wales taxpayers, who have been forced to subsidise the loss-making state Forestry Corporation to the tune of nearly $30 million over the past couple of years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Native forest logging is bad for the environment, bad for climate and bad for taxpayers. It needs to stop, and that means we have to reform our broken environmental laws. Even if the government isn't going to do a whole-scale review of the EPBC Act in this parliament, the government could move now to stop regional forestry agreements so that we could at least stop native forest logging in this term of parliament, and that's what I'm calling on the government to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second area I'd like to talk about is climate and why it's so important that it's integrated into our national environmental laws. The truth is that global heating is having a devastating impact on nature, with rapidly rising ocean temperatures, floods, fires, droughts and extreme weather causing enormous damage to our environment. Our main environmental law does absolutely nothing about this. The EPBC Act does not require emissions to be considered when evaluating project proposals and does not even require them to be disclosed. As a result, 740 fossil fuel projects have been approved since the beginning of the EPBC Act, including four new coalmines in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other side of the coin, because climate is ignored, our environmental laws don't recognise the positive long-term benefits to the nature of renewable energy projects that reduce climate pollution. The government has indicated a willingness to incorporate climate into our national environmental laws in a manner consistent with policies like the safeguard mechanism, but the can has been kicked down the road, and we simply cannot wait any longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge that the road to reform is not smooth. It's a complex process fraught with conflicting opinions, but I know community support is there. Last week I was invited to speak at a community forum hosted by the ACF Eastern Sydney group and the fantastic Stephen Lightfoot. More than 200 people filled the Randwick Town Hall, all desperately asking for reform of our broken environmental laws and, most urgently also, for our native forest logging to be addressed. There is huge appetite for change from the community. Now we need people in this place to show the courage to act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">LAXALE</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  When the government were elected, we faced an environmental crisis that couldn't be ignored. Over the past decade, under the Liberals, Australia witnessed a dramatic decline in the health of our environment—a period marked by a series of policy failures and inaction that left our natural landscapes vulnerable and deteriorating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia state of the environment 2021</span> report, which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition received but chose to hide until after the election, painted a devastating picture. This report revealed that Australia's environment was in dire straits, with our unique ecosystems and wildlife facing unprecedented threats. It revealed that Australia had lost more mammal species to extinction than any other continent, that we had habitat loss equivalent to the size of Tasmania and that rivers in the Murray-Darling Basin were at record-low flows. On the Liberals' watch, invasive species flourished, native vegetation was cleared at alarming rates and our oceans were choked with plastic pollution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much like our current debate over renewable energy, the Liberals and Nationals take a similar stance on environmental policy, one that is anchored in delay and denial. You can't fix a problem that you can't see, and, on the environment, the Liberals and Nationals see no issue to fix. They ignored the critical recommendations of the Samuel review into environmental laws, which called for substantial reforms to protect our natural assets. Instead, they maintained a regulatory framework that failed to safeguard our environment effectively. Their approach to recycling was equally lacklustre. They set targets without any concrete plans to achieve them, happy to release a press release but with nothing to underpin it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals halved the highly protected areas of marine parks, exposing our marine biodiversity to increased threats. Additionally, they slashed funding for the environment department by 40 per cent, crippling the very agency tasked with protecting our natural heritage. The decade under the Liberals was one of wilful environmental neglect, marked by a failure to act in the face of clear and present danger. Theirs is a poor record of missed opportunities and neglect that have left our environment worse off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government inherited this mess. Professor Graeme Samuel, author of the 2020 review, said only a few months ago:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government and the minister are doing everything exactly as they should be doing. I don't underestimate the complexity of what has to be done …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The task to undo the damage from the Liberals is enormous. The task to gain consensus and bring the community with us is enormous. But I was elected, and the government was elected, to address those challenges methodically and with purpose. Our commitment to reversing the damage of the past and ensuring a sustainable future is evident in every environmental policy, every environmental program and every piece of legislation on the environment that we've introduced into this House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our establishment of the world's first nature repair market represents a groundbreaking initiative to encourage the restoration and protection of natural ecosystems. Our expansion of the water trigger will protect our precious water resources. And the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and Environment Information Australia, before the House at the minute, is a huge step forward. It's absurd that Australia does not have a national EPA, and the government must fix that—and, with the support of this parliament, we will. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The EPA will operate as an independent authoritative body with robust enforcement powers, ensuring that our environmental laws, current and future, are upheld and that they are actively enforced. This new agency will be instrumental in holding violators accountable and maintaining the integrity of our environmental protections. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Environment Information Australia will play a crucial role in providing consistent, reliable data on the state of our environment, and, by integrating data collections and reporting, EIA will enable better informed decision-making and greater accountability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are taking and will continue to take action on climate and the environment. We will fight against the Liberal plans to oppose and delay our efforts to decarbonise our economy because we just have to; we cannot rest on our laurels. The environmental challenges we face as a nation are immense and complex. Our environmental reforms cannot end just with what we've announced—there is much more to do. We need to finish the job because the alternative is not an option. Australia deserves and expects a government that not only speaks about environmental protection but acts decisively to achieve it. We must ensure that our efforts remain unwavering and that our commitment to these reforms remains steadfast. As long as I have the privilege to work in this place, I'll work very hard to deliver the full tranche of reforms needed to secure a nature-positive Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The secret is out. The Albanese Labor government wants two key things for Australians: we want Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn. Today, we are just one week away from turning the page on a new financial year. In seven days it will be 1 July, the day that millions of Australians will have thousands of reasons to look forward to. On 1 July, 13.6 million Australians—74,000 of them in Spence—will get a tax cut from that day onward. Each of those 74,000 taxpayers in my electorate are looking at a tax cut, on average, of $1,200.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, 91 per cent of them will get more back because they elected a Labor government. They elected a government that would introduce policies to bring down cost-of-living pressures, like indexing student HELP debt more fairly and backdating it. They've put $3.5 billion towards giving 10 million households and one million small businesses $300 or $325 off their power bills. And there are policies such as 60-day prescriptions, something that has saved people in my electorate of Spence over $2 million through cheaper medicines at the counter—that has happened in picking up their scripts from the chemist since this policy was enacted. These things are only the tip of the iceberg of what this government is doing to help everyday Australians. We're keeping cost-of-living pressures lower and doing it in a measured way, ensuring that we also keep inflation under control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is just one side of the coin. Earlier this month, on 3 June, the Fair Work Commission handed down its decision as part of this year's annual wage review. This was a decision that was a significant win for Australian workers, particularly the 2.6 million workers on an award, including those who are on the minimum wage. From 1 July, those 2.6 million workers will see their wages go up by 3.75 per cent. This means that someone earning the minimum wage on full-time hours will receive an extra $33.10 per week and an extra $1,721 this year. Since the election of our government we have seen three annual wage review decisions handed down—decisions that have resulted in the wages of some of Australia's lowest-paid workers going up to the tune of $143.30 a week, or nearly $7,500 a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These numbers aren't a statistic; they mean more food on the table for families who are working hard, both on the job and in supporting their families—for the millions of Australians who are just trying to get ahead in life. These are the Australians that the Albanese Labor government will always go into bat for. In all three of the annual wage reviews made under our government, all three submissions presented to the Fair Work Commission have done exactly that. These submissions led to a 5.2 per cent pay rise in 2022, an 8.6 per cent rise in 2023 and now a 3.75 per cent rise this year. These increases have contributed to wages growth rising to the highest level in 15 years. And this year's decision received a relatively moderate to muted response from many business groups, with many noting that at least it wasn't the five per cent that was being asked by the ACTU—although I should note that each of the major national business groups which made a submission wanted to see real wages decrease for workers on awards and the minimum wage, with only the Australian Retailers Association proposing an increase with a three in front of it at 3.1 per cent. Contrast that with the five per cent that the SDA, which represents their sectors' workers, had been seeking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That stark contrast can be seen within this place too, with those on one side of this chamber doing their utmost to stop wages going up and to stop many low-income working families from getting ahead, but those on the other side of the chamber instead are fighting for those workers and have been doing so from the very get go. It's that side of the chamber that I am so proud to be moving this motion from—this Labor government that is on the side of working families, families that remember those opposite fighting tooth and nail against our government's changes to close loopholes in our workplace laws that were seeing many workers worse off, with everyone from the Leader of the Opposition to the member for Hume decrying many of those changes because they would push up wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the member for Hume we now go to Senator Hume, who on 3 June, in response to the annual wage review decision, said that providing real wage growth for Australia's lowest paid workers would be the worst thing for Australia. I can think of worse things for Australia than that. After hearing that, one of the worst things for Australia that immediately comes to mind would be another Liberal-National government, one that will keep Australians working more and earning less.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:40</span>):  The member for Spence comes in here and takes credit, on behalf of the Labor government, for the Australian Fair Work Commission's recent wage rise of 3¾ per cent. It's like coming in here and taking credit for the sun coming up. I'll give the member for Spence a little heads up. The sun coming up was coalition policy too, and you can't take credit for these sorts of things when the Fair Work Commission is supposedly, or should be, at arm's length of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He talks about that side being there for and on behalf of the workers. I think we're all in favour of workers, but we're also, on this side, in favour of businesses, and businesses are doing it so tough. But let's just consider the workers for a minute. Let's consider the fact that real wages have gone down under the Albanese government. Let's consider that the cost of health is up nine per cent, the cost of food is up 10 per cent, the cost of housing has risen by 12 per cent and the cost of transport is up 13 per cent. There's the cost of power. The cost of electricity is up 18 per cent, and the cost of gas, if you can get it, is up 25 per cent, and we've got Victoria wanting to shut down gas completely. The cost of insurance is up 26 per cent. Right across the board, workers—those people that Labor purports to represent, to stand up for—are paying more. Every time they go to the petrol bowser, every time they go to the supermarket check-out and every time they flick the power switch, they are paying more. They are paying through the nose. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then we've got a Labor government that says nothing and does very little when the unions move in and take over, just like they did the other day, with John Setka saying that they were going to stop work on all projects that the Australian Football League is trying to put forward, because they don't like somebody who once worked for the former Australian Building and Construction Commission. We've got, dare I say, construction companies in collapse mode. Those small businesses who build houses and who build infrastructure are doing it so tough at the moment, so very tough, and I don't see too many Labor members getting up and supporting them. I don't see too many Labor members getting up and calling out the CFMEU or other union bosses who are making it so tough for our construction industry and so tough for those small businesses which are trying to put a roof over people's heads. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got the cash splash, with $40 million being spent on advertising the government's stage 3 tax cuts. That's $40 million which could have been far better spent on health services—or on anything—but our televisions are being bombarded with advertising which is just so unnecessary. Okay, the tax cuts are there, and people will appreciate it when they get rebates and when they get tax cuts. I appreciate it's something that they did not previously have, but you don't need to keep ramming it down their throats on social media and television—just like the people in regional Australia don't need to keep being told that the Murray-Darling Basin is kaput. They don't need to keep being told that Labor is restoring our river system. I appreciate that we have a different view on that from those opposite. But when our farmers, when our irrigators and when our small-business people in the Murray-Darling Basin are continually being told that the river system is being restored when they know that water is being bought out and that it's actually going to destroy their river towns, their river economies, they know that it is a bridge too far. The amount of money being spent on advertising these tax cuts, quite frankly, is just gross and so unnecessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses are under pressure. And because businesses are under pressure, the first thing they don't do is they don't employ people. They're the workers that this other side, the government, are supposedly representing. We have got a cost-of-living crisis in this nation that is hurting so many people when they go to do their family household budgets. We have a cost-of-living crisis brought about by those opposite and their policies, and, instead of doing something about it, they're just talking about the things that are so unnecessary. They spent $500 million on a divisive referendum; they're not doing much about the economy or our small businesses or our workers.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BYRNES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  Australians are doing it tough right now, and the Albanese Labor government gets that. That is why, in seven days time, we will be giving every taxpayer a tax cut and every household $300 off their energy bills. We believe Australians should earn more and keep more of what they earn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, we believe one of the best ways to deal with cost-of-living pressures is to ensure that workers earn enough to provide for their families. Real wages are growing under Labor. Unemployment is near record lows under Labor. The gender pay gap is down under Labor. And inflation is moderating under Labor. We are getting things done for Australian workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Retail, aged and disability care, health and social welfare, child care, hospitality, tourism and fitness: these are among the industries where we will find our lowest paid workers, with the majority being female and younger Australians. Our government has recommended to the Fair Work Commission to ensure that real wages of Australia's lowest paid workers do not go backwards. In the last three years we have seen changes that have helped contribute to wages growing at the highest level in 15 years. In 2022, our advocacy helped to secure a 5.2 per cent pay rise for workers on the minimum wage. In 2023, our support helped secure a record 8.6 per cent increase. And, again, on 3 June this year we helped secure a 3.75 per cent increase. Since coming to government, the wages of minimum wage earners have increased by $143.30 per week and $7,451.60 per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's Fair Work Commission's annual wage review decision is a win for Australian workers, a win for women and will help with the cost of living. The 3.75 per cent increase to modern award minimum wages will directly help around one in five Australians or 2.6 million workers. People on low wages have the least capacity to deal with the rising cost of living. That's why the Albanese Labor government argued for a decent pay rise for these workers. We have had a greater increase in the minimum wage in two years than the coalition had in their entire decade in office. The former coalition government never once argued for a real wage increase for these workers. The Albanese Labor government has a strong record already, supporting some of our lowest paid but hardest-working cohort in aged care and early childhood education, and this budget threw further support behind additional award wage increases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tax cuts and the minimum wage increase are just the start. We're cutting student debt for more than three million Australians. We know that students are among the lowest paid workers in Australia and by wiping $3 billion in student debt and fixing the indexation we want to make sure that student debt never grows faster than someone's wages or ability to pay it off. We are also introducing a Commonwealth practical placement payment. This is aimed at supporting students who must complete mandatory work placements as a part of their studies. Balancing work and study commitments is difficult at the best of times and it can be extremely stressful if you're not getting paid for these placements. This new payment will benefit eligible students pursuing teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work—some of our most in-demand workers. We are putting women and gender equality at the centre of Australia's economic plan, and this is making women's lives safer, fairer and more equal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that is not all. We have improved and extended paid parental leave, investing $1.2 billion over five years to make the scheme more accessible, flexible and gender equitable. In just seven days, paid parental leave will increase by two weeks, delivering real cost-of-living support for families. We are also providing additional support for women's economic security by introducing superannuation on government funded paid parental leave for parents of babies born or adopted on or after 1 July next year. This measure will help to reduce the impact of parental leave on retirement incomes, with women currently retiring with 25 per cent less superannuation than men. We're delivering further cost-of-living relief in the form of cheaper medicines and a strengthened Medicare system. We are increasing access to Medicare bulk-billed MRI machines across the country in droves and opening an additional 29 Medicare urgent care centres. We know that there's more to do. We are laser focused on supporting Australians with the cost of living.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  It is nice to rise on this motion. In many ways, this motion sums up the hypocrisy and the political spin of those opposite. The member for Spence—good person; Collingwood supporter—has good judgement. It's clear that a minister has put him up to this motion, so this is isn't about him; it's about the motion. The reason it shows the hypocrisy of the Labor government is that they're very happy to claim credit for the independent Fair Work Commission's decision but, when asked about the independent RBA and the 12 interest rate rises under this government, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and those opposite run a mile. So make a decision. If you're going to claim credit for the independent Fair Work Commission, at least have the courage to own the decisions of the independent Reserve Bank of Australia, which has raised interest rates 12 times under this government. You can't have it both ways, and the Australian people see that hypocrisy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what this government does. It's spin and politics. We saw last week that Treasury put out a report about money that the Australian people are supposedly going to get next week. The government is spending taxpayer resources on political spin. What they should be doing is coming up with solutions to drive economic growth, to drive productivity growth—solutions like the Consumer Data Right. The Consumer Data Right is so important in a digital economy, in a digital world. The former coalition government introduced the CDR, but the Assistant Treasurer himself, on 7 June 2023, said about CDR:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The promise of CDR is great. As a competition policy, it has the potential to drive a better deal for consumers across a range of good and services, and drive productivity growth across a number of industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If we make CDR work it can democratise consumer data and lower the barriers to entry and mobility for financial services and wealth creation, so that services that were inaccessible to many people can now be available in their pockets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And he's right. On one thing he's right. But that was 7 June 2023. Since that time, there has been no action from the Assistant Treasurer on the Consumer Data Right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, there was a little bit of action; there was a statutory review of the Consumer Data Right, and that found that the CDR—I quote—'was a game changer'. So we've had a review but no action. The legislation for the CDR was introduced in late 2022 by the Assistant Treasurer. Then it went to a Senate committee, and it received bipartisan support. Since March 2023, it has been a permanent fixture on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>s. Deloitte found that the Australian economy would be $16.7 billion larger by 2043 if the Consumer Data Right were to expand beyond banking and the energy sector, and approximately 46,800 additional jobs could be expected from the combined effect of greater competition and innovation from cross-sector data sharing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Assistant Treasurer knows it's good. The independent data from Deloitte shows it's good. But for over 18 months this government has done nothing to bring this policy forward. It's done nothing to drive economic growth and productivity for the Australian people. They spin independent decisions, but they're not actually taking ownership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that wage rises are crucial, particularly with the cost of living going up. I see those opposite cheer and talk about how, in the last three years, the minimum wage has gone up more than at any other time. Well done! It's because inflation is going through the roof. The cost of living is out of control. It is the equivalent of burning down someone's house, taking them a casserole for dinner and saying: 'Sorry I burnt your house down. Here's a casserole. Please be thankful and grateful.' The reason the minimum wage has to go up so much is that inflation is continuing to grow and compound. It is homegrown, as the RBA governor said, and as the RBA analysis last week showed, the budget was expansionary, and an expansionary budget drives inflation. It puts pressure on all Australians and all household budgets, and all we get from those opposite is spin and politics and taking credit for an independent Fair Work Commission.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I'm really pleased to hear that the previous speaker, the member for Casey, supports wage increases. It is a great shame though that those opposite didn't take that position when they were in government. I must say it's great to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate, and I thank the member for Spence for bringing this important issue to the attention of the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we came to government, minimum wage earners have had their wages increase by $7,451 following the Fair Work Commission's annual wage review decisions. This equates to a total increase of $143.30 every week. This year's increase in the minimum wage to $24.10 per hour will see Australia's lowest paid workers earn an additional $1,721 per year, and that will make a great difference to some of the lowest paid workers in the country. The 3.75 per cent increase will directly and positively impact 2.6 million workers. We have consistently advocated for an increase to the minimum wage both before we were in government and since, unlike those opposite, who shamefully supported plans to suppress wages, and I think it's important that we don't forget that for one moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the increase to the minimum wage we've seen a real, definitive and absolute win for workers. I remember, before the previous election, standing with the now Prime Minister at a press conference when he was asked the question: do you support a wage increase for the lowest paid workers in the country? And he famously said, 'Absolutely.' He was criticised roundly by those opposite for making such a claim. I really do hope that they have had time in the last two-and-a-bit years to reflect on that shameful episode where they sought to see the lowest paid workers in this country, who helped get us through the very worst times in the pandemic, being set backwards. I really hope they have reflected on that dark chapter in their own history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this wage increase decision is a win for women, for workers and for families, and it will help with cost-of-living relief. The increase of $143 per week delivers on our commitment to Australians that they will earn more and keep more of what they earn. We want to see strong and sustainable wages growth across the country because we see this as part of the solution to the cost-of-living challenge and not part of the problem, unlike those opposite. We believe that one of the best ways to deal with cost-of-living pressures is to ensure that workers earn enough to provide for their loved ones and can get ahead to have that bit of extra money to spend in their local communities and keep local economies alive. We've gone in to fight for Australian workers. We recommended to the Fair Work Commission that they ensure that real wages increase for low-paid workers rather than go backwards. It was our advocacy in 2022 that helped secure a 5.2 per cent pay rise for workers on the minimum wage. Last year we backed that up by supporting a record 8.6 per cent increase, and saw earlier this month a 3.75 per cent increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from these increases in wages, we've also delivered cost-of-living relief across a number of areas, including ensuring that there will be a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer in just a week's time. We've delivered cheaper medicines. We're delivering energy bill relief and cheaper child care. We're strengthening Medicare and we're increasing support payments. We do not think low wages should be part of any government strategy, in terms of our economic policy. We are proudly and unapologetically in favour of workers earning more and keeping more of what they earn. We've heard from members of the shadow frontbench already that if low-paid workers got real wages growth it would be the worst thing for Australia. That is a shameful comment to make, and I do hope that those opposite reflect on the harm that statements like that can do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the two years since we've come to government, we've seen increases to the minimum wage. We're relieving cost-of-living pressures on families. We want people to earn more and keep more of what they earn, and we will not apologise for that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I want to acknowledge the front of the member for Spence. The member for Spence is many things, but I would have thought, after what we saw in the news last week, with Mr Setka coming out lambasting and threatening to hold Australians and Australian governments to ransom, that, like most people with any modicum of self-acknowledgment, the member for Spence would have quietly shelved this motion and said to the Chief Government Whip, 'Can we make this motion go away for a couple of weeks?' But no. This guy's got more front than Myer in Queen Street in Brisbane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it quite amazing to see and hear what the CFMEU secretary, John Setka, came out with last week. It's on industrial relations. He came out and threatened—and called upon governments—that the CFMEU would black-ban their sites if Steven McBurney wasn't sacked as the chief umpire from the AFL. Those opposite want to come in here and start talking about industrial relations reform, and the member for Spence puffs up his chest and talks about what a great job they've done. And then, in the meantime, John Setka comes out and absolutely gives every reason to every Australian—28 million Australians—why this government is absolutely stuffing up industrial relations. It's because this government is beholden to the unions—we all know that!—particularly the CFMEU. The CFMEU donated how much to the Labor Party's coffers last year? Four million dollars. But because John Setka comes out and says, 'Prime Minister, you need to stay out of this; you need to clear out of this—you just let me have my say,' what we saw from the Prime Minister was: 'Yes, Mr Setka. Four million dollars is a lot of money, Mr Setka. Whatever you say goes, Mr Setka.' The rank hypocrisy of those members opposite, coming in here and trying to pump up their chests about industrial relations whilst the CFMEU—openly, outwardly and proudly—wants to hold 28 million Australians to ransom, and while those opposite still take their $4 million in political donations, is unbelievable. It takes a lot of front for the member for Spence to come in here and keep this motion on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What makes it even more interesting is that those members opposite want to talk about the great job that they are doing on cost of living for Australians. Every single person in the gallery right now—and anybody that might be listening to this on the radio or watching it on television or online—ask yourself this question: do you feel better off today than you did in May 2022? I don't think you will feel better off. Why is that? It is because gas is up, electricity is up and mortgages are up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The average Australian family with a $750,000 mortgage—believe it or not, $750,000 is an average mortgage now—is paying $24,000 a year more, after tax, than they were paying when we were in government. That's an extra $2,000 a month. What family can afford that? This lot talk about the importance of cost-of-living relief. Every single Australian family is subject to inflationary pressures. That is what we're seeing, with the cost of living going up and up on everything, and this lot, this government, is trying to pump up its chest and say what a good job it's doing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I rise to support the motion moved by the hardworking member for Spence in relation to the Fair Work Commission's annual wage review handed down during 2024. I'm incredibly disappointed to hear those opposite being so negative and personally attacking the member for Spence for his motion. I have been in this chamber on a number of occasions and been very respectful and understanding of people's views, and I was very disappointed to hear that comment about the member for Spence. It's just not acceptable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To begin, the Fair Work Commission, Australia's independent workplace relations tribunal, conducts an annual review to determine whether there should be an adjustment to the minimum wage rate and modern award minimum wage. This year's decision is particularly noteworthy given the economic challenges and uncertainties that we have been facing, including the post-pandemic recovery, inflationary pressures and global economic fluctuations. The 2024 decision means that 2.6 million low-paid workers on awards or the minimum wage will receive a pay rise of 3.75 per cent from 1 July 2024. That's not difficult to understand. Full-time workers on the minimum wage will receive an extra $33.10 per week or $1,721 per year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the election of the Albanese Labor government the minimum wage has increased by $143.30 per week, or approximately $7,450 per year, which will mean a lot to those families. This government has delivered on its commitment for our people to earn more and keep more of what they earn. We're also delivering cost-of-living relief without adding to inflation, with inflation having been almost halved since the Albanese Labor government came to office. This is incredibly important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our recent budget provided a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer and more help with energy bills, rent and the cost of medicines. All 13.6 million Australian taxpayers will get a tax cut. In Western Australia the combined state and federal energy bill relief for Pearce households is $700. Across Australia, energy relief of $325 is available for one million small businesses. We have increased Commonwealth rent assistance for nearly one million households. We have provided up to $3 billion to make medicines cheaper, freezing the maximum cost of PBS prescriptions for everyone—a decision that is proving to be incredibly popular in my electorate. We have waived almost $3 billion in student debt, helping more than three million, mostly younger, Australians. We want a fairer deal for consumers at the supermarket checkout, superannuation to be paid on paid parental leave, more funding for emergency, food relief and financial support services and provisioning for higher wages for aged-care and childcare workers. We have also extended the freeze on deeming rates for 876,000 income support recipients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission's decision reflects the need to support equitable wage growth and recognises the importance of ensuring that all workers benefit from economic progress and that wage disparity does not widen any further. But it appears that those opposite still cling to outdated views on wages policy, something that was very apparent at the start of this motion with the negative comments that were made. My mum always used to say to me, 'The truth hurts,' and clearly that is the case with those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not surprising to learn about the plans that the opposition revealed, in which they want Australians to work longer for less, and that is totally unacceptable. The Albanese Labor government has a budget that is responsible and restrained, that eases cost-of-living pressures and that invests in a future made in Australia. It is a budget that will build more homes for Australians, reform our universities, strengthen Medicare and the care economy and broaden opportunities in our society. I firmly believe that the commission's decision and the actions taken by our government reflect the need to support equitable wage growth so that all workers benefit from economic progress and that wage disparity does not widen further. Those workers, during the pandemic, gave everything they had to support our country. They did so willingly and they did it well. They were effective. So they should not be underestimated in what they can achieve, and they deserve the support of our government.</span>
              </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  I have risen to speak on motions like this probably many times in my time in the parliament, and it is very clear to me now that this is another promotion that has come straight out of polling. The Labor Party repeat, 'We want you to have more money and keep more of your money.' They have proposals here in the budget. But I would like to take them up on just a couple of things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the energy bill relief is targeted and helpful for people, energy bills have gone through the roof so badly that these measures haven't got the punch that they would have had if we hadn't had the increases that we're experiencing now through inflation. Household insurance and business insurance doubled in many cases last year and had a further increase this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's the hidden costs that I want to talk about today. What are the hidden costs that are hitting people very hard? I'll give you two examples. I know they're both state issues, but families are families are families. We're responsible for them, state governments are responsible for them, and local governments are responsible for them. Everybody's taken their chip, to the point where a report from the other day, from a welfare agency that provides food and welfare for the community, said, 'The people that used to donate to us are now coming to us for food parcels.' That's an indictment on everything that we're doing at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first example, a builder is picked up on a camera—a speed camera or a camera checking registrations et cetera—and they find out that the tandem trailer is two days over its registered date and that the builder was driving around with a trailer that had been unregistered for two days. Fair enough. You would think you'd get a reasonable fine for that. The registration for that trailer is $75. The fine is $772, and if you don't pay it within the given time then it's another $65 on top of that for compliance. I'll give you another example of what's happening to people out in the community. This guy is speeding; he's eight kilometres over. He gets a fine, because his car is registered under a business name, of $3,698. That is a fine for being eight kilometres over. Just take those two instances and recognise that that's happening to thousands and thousands of people and families right across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where do governments get off with such outrageous challenges to anybody just going about their daily business? Every one of us has probably been eight kilometres over and not been fined or been 14 kilometres over and been fined. We never know where the cameras are, but, just the same, we all try to be law-abiding citizens. Fines like that are outrageous. They have to be paid, and the families that are on lower and middle incomes don't have $3,000 just sitting around. They don't have $772 just sitting around waiting to be paid to the state government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to say: in all the representations we make as parliamentarians on behalf of our community, we have to decide how we're going to better distribute the funds that are available to us. Where are the priorities of this nation on where we're spending our money against the pensioners and single-income earners in Australia that should be getting the best support we can possibly give them? I don't think we should be sending our good money to places where there may be disagreement within our community on where that money should go. We didn't vote to send money overseas to places we've been sending money to; you might have voted in a different way had you known that was going to happen. It's time we put families first. It's an old saying—that we put families first—but I mean it, from grandma and granddad all the way through to children. It says in here—not enough, apparently.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) calls on the Government to compel the states and territories to collect and share data relating to the quality of Australian roads, the causes of crashes, and the effectiveness of road safety measures as a condition of the $50 billion in federal road funding allocated over the next five years under the National Partnership Agreement on Land Transport Infrastructure Projects.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Six-hundred and seventy-seven lives were lost on Australian roads in the six months to 31 December 2023. In fact, since lodging this motion 114 people have lost their lives on roads in Australia to April 2024. That's a 24.7 per cent increase over the average for April for the preceding five years. We are heading in the wrong direction. In the year to 30 April 1,310 people died on Australian roads, up from 1,178 a year earlier. Again, we are headed in the wrong direction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What, then, can we do about that? For some considerable time, I, together with the AAA, the peak motorist body in this country, have been calling on those opposite to collect and release data regarding those tragedies, with a view to guiding policy decision-making and, of course, to compelling state governments to collect that data, which they do, but also to provide it. After all, the federal government provides more funding than you can fly a rocket ship over to state and territory governments to invest in their infrastructure network, including the land transport network in this country, which comprises a tick over 800,000 kilometres and where these lives are lost. I am grateful that those opposite, belatedly and after a consistent campaign stretching for more than two years, have announced that they will meet the request to collect that data and force states to release that information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is little more that we do know. We still don't know how often states and territories will be compelled to report the data or how government will ensure the data is consistent; which data will be included, and how quickly it will be made publicly accessible. This data needs to cover the quality of Australian roads, the causes of crashes, the effectiveness of each state's road rules and enforcement regimes as it's crucial for understanding the nation's road trauma problems and for developing effective responses. Data sharing would reveal which state's road safety measures are most effective and the safety interventions that are most needed. That would not only save lives but also end the politicisation of road funding, because it will reveal where the funding is most needed and it will ensure funding goes to the areas of most need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in the past I've been accused of being a little cynical, but I'd respectfully suggest to this place that one of the reasons why the states and territories are disinclined to share that data is because they want to continue to fund projects that are politically popular, that tick the electoral need box, but that's not what road safety should be about. Road safety should be about driving down the statistics I spoke about at the beginning of this contribution. We should be on the right pathway, not the wrong pathway. And whilst I congratulate those opposite for finally heeding the call, there's so much more to do. Give us the detail so that we can assess whether you'll be good on making that commitment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  I thank the member for Barker for moving this motion. As a doctor, I have witnessed firsthand the devastating impact road trauma has on individuals, families and communities. Many days at the Alfred, a major trauma hospital in Australia, were and remain scenes of unspeakable suffering and anguish as victims of road trauma were either driven in or, in the most severe cases, choppered in while their relatives often were the ones holding up the walls in the hospital in grief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No electorate is untouched by road trauma. In March, two young people—kids who were from my electorate—died when a car driven by a 17-year-old male hit a tree in Toorak. Our local priest, Father Peter French, witnessed an inferno where the screams were also audible. Both of these children died. The community remain traumatised and are calling on council and the state government to make changes to Clendon Road to slow down the traffic. They also want consideration given to actually closing off one end of Clendon Road, to stop drivers from gathering this sort of speed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent surge in road fatalities in Australia is a grim reminder of the urgent need for effective road safety measures and comprehensive data sharing to address this escalating crisis. In the year leading up to the end of May 2024, Australia recorded just over 1,300 road deaths, marking a 10 per cent increase from the previous year. May 2024 saw 96 fatalities alone. This follows a particularly deadly 2023 across the nation, and this is evident in the Alfred. It was also evident just after the early years of the pandemic, when we saw an uptick in road trauma victims, and there was an anecdotal sense that this was due to greater risk taking in the community. We can't forget that road trauma also includes serious injury, much of which results in life-changing outcomes. In 2021 alone, there were nearly 40,000 serious injuries on Australian roads. These numbers are not just statistics. They represent lives lost, families shattered and communities left to grapple with the aftermath of these avoidable tragedies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the rising road toll, the Albanese government held a national road safety conference in April of this year which brought together more than a hundred road safety stakeholders to identify a range of short-term government and industry actions that can stem this tide. We know that the top five causes of a rising road toll are (1) speed, (2) alcohol and other drug impaired driving, or AOD, (3) driver distraction, (4) failure to obey traffic lights and signs, and (5) fatigue, all of which are entirely preventable. Every single one of these causes is preventable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has listened and is acting. The National Road Safety Action Plan 2023-25 cites the importance of community education and awareness, and to that end we are kicking in over $10 million to fund a national road safety and awareness campaign. The other projects include targeting vulnerable road users, First Nations communities, technology, innovation, and research and data. We're also, it goes without saying, attempting to improve the quality of our roads, and to that end we are committing nearly $3 billion towards a road safety program over five years from 2021. It's estimated that these projects will upgrade approximately 15,000 kilometres of roads, and there are currently over 1,600 projects approved. The government are also doubling the Roads to Recovery funding, from $500 million to $1 billion, and we are substantially increasing the Black Spot Program, which will be progressively increased from $110 million to $150 million a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps most important, however, is the need to harmonise data and to collect better data so that our response is actually data driven and data informed. We can announce that we have reached agreement with the states to achieve just that, and that is critically important. We will be creating a nationally consistent dataset. This is the first step towards creating a much more holistic data informed approach to bringing down the road toll. To support this effort we have committed $21 million to the National Road Safety Data Hub to support enhanced evidence-based road safety strategies, with an aim of eliminating road trauma by 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As with housing, energy and health care, the previous coalition government's inaction has led to this disaster or contributed to it. We are making up for lost time and intend to push on.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  It's not the first time that I've stood in this place to remind those opposite what government's primary purpose is, and that is to keep its citizens safe. Often I'm referring to the national geopolitical trend or trends, but today my focus couldn't be more local or more grassroots. It's something that impacts everybody, no matter where you live. And, if you live in rural or regional Australia, statistically and tragically, you are disproportionately impacted. I am talking of road trauma. No matter how much money, effort or goodwill we have poured into reducing road trauma across Australia over the past 20 years, it has failed. That's a fact. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2004 there were 1,583 deaths on Australian roads, and in 2013 there were 1,193. In this year, to date, it is 1,310. There has been no statistical improvement. In Tasmania, it's a similar story. In 2014 we had 33 fatalities and 267 serious injuries. In 2023 those figures had risen to 35 fatalities and 309 serious injuries. Although young adults under 25 make up just 11 per cent of the Tasmanian population, 16- to 25-year-olds make up 21 per cent—21 per cent—of all deaths and serious injuries on Tasmanian roads. So the question is: what can we do about this? Well, we know that this is happening. We can see the statistics but, clearly, we are yet to identify and to implement best practice countermeasures to combat this terrible waste of human life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Data means everything. It is impossible to implement an effective road safety strategy without meaningful data collection across all Australian jurisdictions. I am sure that the public will be perplexed when I tell them currently there is no state or territory government that provides road safety data to the federal government. As we draw to the end of this Albanese government's term, they have done nothing to rectify this. This is despite their promises in the lead-up to the election that they would look at this very important oversight. Two years on and they have not moved—well, not until my good friend the member for Barker lodged this important and pertinent motion. Now all of a sudden it has become very important to Minister King, because the member for Barker has shone an important spotlight on another broken promise by the Prime Minister that he has tried to sweep this under the carpet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2023, the Australian road network recorded its deadliest six months in nearly 14 years, yet data relating to the quality of our state and territory roads remains a secret. The causes of these crashes remain the privileged information of the state and territory governments respectively. The effectiveness of each state's road rules and enforcement regime is not shared. Without this shared data we will never be able to develop effective countermeasures to reduce road death or trauma that would not only save lives but it would go a long way towards ending the politicisation of road funding. We would know whether or not governments are investing in the roads that need the safety upgrades, whether they are investing in roads to shore up marginal seats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all have a part to play in reducing deaths and injuries from road accidents. This includes the road designers, the vehicle manufacturers, road users and the like. But the decision of policymakers at the state and federal government level must be at the forefront of driving our goal of zero road deaths. I call on the minister to honour the Albanese government's promise to compel states and territories to provide better quality data in return for funding road projects. Australia is facing a road safety crisis and the data states and territories hold is key to developing a meaningful solution—that is, a meaningful reduction in road deaths and injuries in our states and territories.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  Road safety impacts all Australians. In May 2023, my electorate, Hawke, was shaken by an alarming road traffic accident, a collision between a truck and a primary school bus in Eynesbury. This incident, which resulted in a number of serious injuries to the children on board the school bus, served as a harsh reminder of the importance of road safety across our entire community. This tragedy affected our whole community—the children, their families, the first responders who attended the crash. There are no words to express how terrifying the crash must have been and the pain these children had to go through, as well as the broader impact that this has had on our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These roads are used every day to help people commute to and from work and school. Each one of these commuters deserves to be safe on the road, to know that the government is committed to ensuring them a safer trip home to their loved ones. The Eynesbury crash underscored the necessity for us to prioritise road safety, not as a political issue, as those opposite seek to do, but as a matter of public safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Road traffic incidents are more than just statistics. These are peoples' families, friends and loved ones. That is why, as part of the Black Spot Program, the Albanese Labor government is funding safety improvements for roads in Eynesbury, an important contribution towards reducing serious injuries for all road users. The treatment will include better shielding for roadside hazards, upgrades to create dedicated left- and right-turn lanes, realignment of line markings and the installation of kerbs and channels. By progressively increasing the Black Spot program's funding to $150 million a year, the Australian government, the Albanese Labor government, is taking action to reduce the road toll. The range of safety measures included in the program seek to ensure that the chance of another serious crash on Hawke's roads is significantly reduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Road safety is a shared responsibility for us all, one that the Albanese Labor government shares with our communities. It's a responsibility that we take very seriously. Our Labor government is committed to taking clear and decisive action to enhance road safety measures. That's why we're doubling the Roads to Recovery funding, bringing it up to a billion dollars a year. This will support the construction and maintenance of local road infrastructure, creating better accessibility and safety for our communities. Additionally, the Labor government is working with the National Road Safety Data Hub to find more interventions and strategies that help keep our roads safe. Our goal is simple: to make our roads safer for everyone so that no child, no commuter and no worker is unreasonably put at risk on our roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the Albanese Labor government passed our closing loopholes legislation. Following a years-long campaign from the Transport Workers Union, this legislation introduced a suite of changes designed to protect not only transport workers but all road users. The legislation has empowered the Fair Work Commission to set minimum standards for the road transport industry to ensure that safety isn't compromised by cost cutting and tight margins. These changes have made our trucking industry sustainable, viable and, more importantly, safer. The closing loopholes legislation also empowered the Fair Work Commission to set minimum standards for our gig workers. We know that there is a direct link between low rates of pay and safety. It leads to a situation where workers take risks so they can get more work because they're struggling to make ends meet. That's why the Albanese Labor government changed the law to better protect Australian gig workers' rights to fair pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Transport Workers Union for their unwavering advocacy in pursuing these changes that will make our roads safer for everyone. I also want to thank them for the work they do each and every day to protect the pay and conditions of transport workers right across the country. I'd like to give a special shout-out to my dear friend the TWU Vic/Tas Branch Secretary, Mem Suleyman, for his years of dedication to supporting transport workers as well as Michael Kaine and the TWU national office for their extraordinary leadership in this space. By making the transport workers safer, by making the transport industry safer, the TWU is making every road in Australia safer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  Road safety is so important in our society. Better roads mean fewer deaths on those roads. The member for Hawke politicised his argument. He said, 'Those opposite always make a political plaything out of this'—not true; not true. But, seeing as he wants to take this motion there, the 90-day review put in place by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the member for Ballarat, prior to the federal budget last year, which turned into a prolonged, protracted, 200-plus-day review, led to a number of road projects being stalled. It led to a number of major infrastructure projects concerning our arterial roads—and, dare I say, our smaller byways as well—losing workers for those projects, and the road toll is up. That is a fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a total of 96 road deaths during the month of May 2024. It's higher than what it was previously. One death—one injury—on our roads is one too many. We lose 1,200 or so Australians each and every year on our roads, and that figure doesn't even generally take into account, when it's being talked about in the media, the tens of thousands of people who get injured in those and other road crashes. I know that, when I was in the portfolio area of responsibility for road safety, I took that very seriously—the issue of making sure that we had the right infrastructure in the right places. Our regional people are all too overrepresented in the road toll statistics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, whilst driving around my very large Riverina electorate, I noticed that the line-markers were out doing those audio-tactile lines on the sides of the roads and widening the centre lines by painting another line up the middle of the road. The centre lines, the gap between one side of the road and the traffic going the other way, were what former deputy prime minister and Nationals leader John Anderson used to call the 'corridor of uncertainty'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take great pride in reflecting on the Roads to Recovery initiative. That program was brought about by the same John Anderson when he was the member for Gwydir and the infrastructure minister in this place. When you look at programs such as that and the other initiatives that we subsequently brought in—the Great Western Highway upgrade, the Beef Roads Program, the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program—so many of those specific targeted road projects and programs are saving lives. I was very proud when I was the Deputy Prime Minister that we put in place that $3 billion for the road safety upgrade during COVID because it has saved lives, and it will save lives. There will be people who may never know that they have been saved by just one of those audio-tactile lines on the side of the road, if late at night, or at any given time of the day, they just happen to veer slightly over before hearing that 'thump, thump' and realising: 'I've veered over. Straighten up and make sure I stay in my lane.' Making sure that we put that very slight additional room in the middle of the road by just another line makes roads safer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the work that the heavy-haulage transport operators have also put in this place. I take the member for Hawke up. He came in here and praised the union. I want to praise truck companies and particularly Andy Fox and Ron Finemore, who have two of the biggest transport companies in this country, for what they have done as far as road safety is concerned. We're all trying to get to zero 50—making sure that there are no deaths on our roads by 2050. It's a noble initiative and it's a difficult initiative. It won't be done by stalling road projects.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  When I was a police officer in the traffic branch, before I would let a driver go, I would always say, 'Safe journey home.' If it were a Chinese driver, I would say, 'Zai jian,' which translates as 'goodbye' or 'see you again'. Even as I said those words, I knew the journey was not always safe, and sometimes there was no 'again'. I've witnessed far too often the ugly heartbreak of death on Australian roads. I remember being called to a scene where a traffic crash happened between a bus and a motorcyclist. As a first responder, this tragedy stayed in my mind for a long time. I can only imagine the family's pain. That such a traffic accident could happen in a low-speed area, a 60-kilometre zone, makes this tragedy even more difficult to process.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Labor government is investing in road safety to help stem the rising road toll. We are doubling the Roads to Recovery funding from $500 million to $1 billion a year. We are also increasing the Black Spot Program funding. It's rising from $110 million to $150 million a year. For my constituents in Tangney, the Labor Black Spot program means the installation of a roundabout and upgraded street lighting at the intersection of Corbel Street and Modillion Avenue north in Shelley. In January 2021, a tragic accident happened at this intersection which claimed the life of a young 17-year-old boy. I'm thankful that this black spot funding has been addressed by our government and I'm grateful to his parents for advocating this change. I want to stress that everyone can advocate that black spots to be addressed—everyone can—so please advocate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are implementing the National Road Safety Strategy, which is supported by the National Road Safety Action Plan 2023-25. This plan is in collaboration with all states, territories and local governments because we must all cooperate and collaborate on this vital issue. The road safety action plan is linked with data collection, and one key action is for road safety data to be officially exchanged and published.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In April 2024 there was a historic first. Each of the state and territory governments signed an intergovernmental road safety data sharing agreement. We want to improve data sharing, have a nationally consistent dataset and have high quality and timely data. To support this effort, the Albanese Labor government has committed $21 million to the National Road Safety Data Hub.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was a police officer in the traffic section, I used to give infringements to drivers. I would ask them to please remember the reason. Sometimes they got infringements because of speeding, sometimes it was for not wearing a seatbelt and sometimes it was for using their mobile phones when they were driving. All drivers need to understand the importance of road safety and good driving behaviour. This is why we are providing $10.8 million for a national road safety and awareness campaign. Education and awareness are so important.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been $2.96 billion committed to the road safety program over five years to support the rollout of life-saving road safety treatments to ultimately reduce death and serious injury from crashes on our roads. It is estimated that this project will upgrade approximately 15,460 kilometres of Australia's roads.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are focused on the delivery of this action plan, including committing $43.6 million to deliver non-infrastructure road safety programs. These comprehensive road safety measures are to help us to get to Vision Zero—zero fatalities and zero serious injuries on our roads—by 2050 so that all Australians can truly have a safe journey home. </span>

                  </a>  I have moved—but I'm happy to run through it again for the benefit of the minister. I've moved that so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent a minister from immediately introducing, without notice, a bill to amend the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I return to the explanation to the House of why such a suspension is necessary. First of all, it is necessary to canvass the appalling track record of the CFMEU and of John Setka, a man notorious for his criminality and thuggishness. The urgency arises because of the desperate desire of many in the union movement, including within the merged CFMEU, to get as far away from Mr Setka as possible. The second reason why this is necessary is the hopeless record of equivocation, spinelessness and backflips from the ALP, and from the member for Watson in particular. And the third is the inadequacy of the other procedural paths which have been proposed to deal with this very urgent matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn, firstly, to the appalling track record of the CFMEU and of John Setka. He runs a union which is a byword for thuggery, for intimidation, for violence and for criminality. Federal Court judges have regularly described the attitude of CFMEU officials—who are regularly before that court—as clearly regarding the fines and the criminal convictions that they regularly rack up as simply part of doing business. What we know is that Mr Setka is from the construction and maritime divisions, and that there's a very big, ongoing fight with the mining and manufacturing division, led by Michael O'Connor. What we know, in particular, is that just in the last two or three weeks, Mr Setka has managed, if it were possible, to enhance his already appalling record for thuggery and intimidation with the threats that he has directed at the AFL—particularly at Mr Stephen McBurney, who is the Head of Officiating for the AFL.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the stated rationale for Mr Setka's threats? It is that Mr McBurney was previously the head of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, and that, in that role, he was responsible for bringing evidence of the CFMEU's bullying, thuggery and intimidation before the courts. In 91 per cent of those cases, they were found to have breached the Fair Work Act. Mr Setka doesn't like that at all. The CFMEU were fined millions of dollars for those breaches. What has Mr Setka said? I'm going to use the word 'flipper' in place of a particular word that he used, and I'm going to use the word 'flip' in place of another particular word that he used, so as not to offend the dignity of the House. He said: 'We have an obligation to pursue anti-union, anti-worker flippers like him and we will until the end of the earth … This is going to cost the AFL a lot of flipping money. I hope it's worth it. Projects without our full cooperation are going to be a flipping misery for them … They will regret the day they ever employed him.' That's Mr Setka: what a quality individual he is!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we know the union he leads is notorious for the intimidation of women. This was seen once there was a merger between the textile, clothing and footwear membership into the broader CFMEU. One of the union representatives—not an employer representative but a union representative—had this to say about the workplace culture of the CFMEU offices:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Within the building there were jokes about domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That does not sound like an appropriate thing to joke about at all. What has Mr Setka's estranged wife had to say? In a sworn statement to police in August 2019 she said: 'John was out of control. He hit my head against the table about five times. It was very painful.' This is the quality individual we are talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn, secondly, to why this is urgent and why standing orders need to be suspended. It is because of the hopeless equivocation and spinelessness of the Labor Party and of the member for Watson in relation to this issue. It is amazing what $4.3 million worth of donations will do to your integrity. It's amazing what you are prepared to look away from when you get $4.3 million worth of donations. It's amazing how you are prepared to overlook violence and thuggery towards women when you get $4.3 million worth of donations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were in government, we introduced a piece of legislation designed to deal with this. We said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There are various circumstances that might give rise to a constituent part of an amalgamated organisation forming the view that the amalgamation is no longer serving the best interests of its members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were pointing to the simple fact that since there has been an amalgamation, and the thugs of the construction and maritime parts of the CFMEU have been part of a broader amalgamated union, there has been a continuing desire by those—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would amend the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 to allow the manufacturing division of the CFMEU to apply to the Fair Work Commission for a ballot of members about withdrawing from that union. The bill sets out eligibility rules of the new organisation that would apply if the ballot is successful, modifies certain provisions of the registered organisations act to allow an orderly ballot to occur and includes safeguards to address instances of overlap in the eligibility rules between the two resulting organisations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides for a legislative instrument to be made if the manufacturing division and the CFMEU reach agreement on eligibility rules and the CFMEU's new name by 30 August 2024 and written notice with prescribed information is given to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. If this occurs, the minister is given the power to modify the application of the registered organisations act and the registered organisations regulations. This would be to give effect to the withdrawal of the manufacturing division or anything connected with that withdrawal. Safeguards on this power mean it is time limited and can only be exercised in relation to these particular circumstances. I hope all members will support this legislation, which will give affected members of the manufacturing division the opportunity to vote on whether to demerge from the CFMEU.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a cost-of-living crisis and the government has to make a choice between backing ordinary Australians getting screwed over by the supermarkets or the supermarket duopoly—Coles and Woolworths—making billions of dollars of profits off people's misery. We know right now that this Labor government is choosing Coles and Woolworths. Oxfam reported that in 2022 alone Woolworths made $5 billion in crisis profits—that is, profits off the crisis going on at the moment—price gouging ordinary Australians and forcing them to choose, make awful choices, between paying the rent, feeding their kids, cutting back on grocery bills and skipping meals just so their kids can afford to eat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, just this week I spoke to a pensioner using our free food community pantry who told me her rent had just gone up $150 a week. As a result, she could no longer afford to shop at the local Coles and Woolworths. She was being forced to make tough choices. A pensioner who had worked hard all her life is now getting screwed over by a system that always puts the interests of big corporations like Coles and Woolworths ahead of ordinary people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is there are things the government could do right now. This is urgent because the government could take actions right now that tackle the power of Coles and Woolworths. We know Coles and Woolworths have 65 per cent of the supermarket share in Australia right now, and they use that power to drive up prices and screw over ordinary Australians. There are recommendations from the Greens led Senate inquiry that would tackle this issue in two important ways. First is making price gouging illegal. None of the recommendations Labor has agreed to make price gouging illegal. It is perfectly legal right now for Coles and Woolworths to continue to price gouge ordinary Australians and use their awesome and huge market power to screw over ordinary people. Second is giving the ACCC the power to go and break up the market share of Coles and Woolworths. We know that in the United States, the UK and other countries around the world, their supermarket profit shares are much smaller; in fact, Coles and Woolworths have the largest profit margins of any comparable supermarkets in the developed world. They do so because they have a huge market share they can use to screw over ordinary Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we give the ACCC the power to break up Coles and Woolworths, reduce their market share, increase competition and drive down prices, that will help ordinary Australians. But the Labor government have refused to do any of that. Now they have agreed to enforce the code of conduct between suppliers and supermarkets. That is good, but the problem is they've done nothing to touch the huge profit margins Coles and Woolworths are making. Not only that; while they are making these huge crisis profits, Labor refuses to even tax them fairly so we can raise money off Coles and Woolworths and use that to go and help people struggling with the cost of living. They basically get massive crisis profits, pay barely any tax on those excess profits and don't have to reduce their market share like supermarkets around the world, and it's perfectly legal for them to continue to price gouge ordinary Australians. People are getting fed up with a Labor government that continues to tinker around the edges of a massive cost-of-living crisis and refuses to do anything substantial to tackle the structural issues in our economy and political system that allow big corporations to screw over ordinary Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That same Oxfam report found something pretty remarkable—that the share of national income going to corporate profits had reached a record high in Australian history. At exactly the same time we hear about this cost-of-living and inflation crisis, the government seem to have decided they're going to let the RBA jack up interest rates and punish ordinary mortgage holders and renters for a crisis they had nothing to do with. We know who is causing this crisis—big corporations, particularly Coles and Woolworths, who, under previous Labor and Liberal governments, have accrued enormous power and are using that power right now to drive up prices and screw over ordinary Australians. They are Chevron, Exxon Mobil, big oil and gas corporations, Coles and Woolworths and the big banks. Just last year Commonwealth Bank recorded a record $10 billion profit. Across the board big corporations are screwing over mortgage holders, people trying to go to the supermarkets, renters and people trying to make ends meet, but at the same time those big corporations are making massive profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear about the human consequences of this. I remember chatting to a renter who was having to cut back on meals for herself just so she could afford her baby's nappy rash cream. I have been chatting to pensioners having to make tough choices and single mums skipping meals so their kids can afford to eat. This should not happen in a wealthy country like Australia. It is particularly deeply frustrating when we know, at the same time, that the government has the power to tackle this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister made these absurd comparisons to the Soviet Union when the Greens proposed rules and laws that exist in the United States. I would be surprised if anyone was going to make a comparison between the United States and the Soviet Union. It would be laughable if the consequences were not so serious. Time and again the government and the Prime Minister seem more interested in making silly, stupid jokes than in treating their roles with the seriousness with which they should treat them and recognising that they are in government. How is it that they can continue to pretend they don't have the power to do these things? All of a sudden they're the government and they are the ones with the power, but they keep pretending all they can do is say nice words and tell people they feel their pain. It is all hypocritical and all useless if they don't take action to help people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we are suspending standing orders because there is an urgent crisis going on right now, and there are practical things the government could do to take on the power of Coles and Woolworths. The fundamental choice this Labor government has to make is whether it chooses ordinary Australians doing it tough or the massive supermarkets, the Coles and the Woolworths, screwing over ordinary Australians. Here are the three things you could do right now: support the Greens bill in the Senate to allow the government and the ACCC to break up the market share of Coles and Woolworths; make price gouging illegal and give the ACCC the power to take Coles and Woolworths to court when they are caught price gouging ordinary Australians; and introduce a superprofits tax on Coles, Woolworths and all the other big corporations screwing over ordinary people, raise billions of dollars and use that to help ordinary Australians doing it tough.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles"> of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  I second the motion. It is critical that this parliament and politicians take action today, because right now there will be people going to the checkout at Coles and Woolies and putting items aside because they can't afford them. There will be people skipping meals because rent has soared on average by $100 and mortgages by about $200 a week under this Labor government. They are now putting items back onto the shelf and skipping meals because they can't afford to do everything because we are in a cost-of-living crisis. This is happening at the same time as these supermarkets, Coles and Woolies, are raking in billions of dollars of profits, and they're price gouging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the consumer organisation CHOICE has made very clear, when you go to Coles or Woolies, there's almost no difference in price at the end of the day. But, in many places around this country, that's the only choice that you've got. And we've got one of the most concentrated supermarket sectors in the world, which means these massive corporations have huge amounts of power to set the price wherever they want and to price gouge. In the face of that, the government could do something. The government could take on these big corporations, make price gouging illegal and say, 'Enough of your profiteering in a cost-of-living crisis; we are going to back people.' But, instead, the government comes up today with an announcement that effectively says they're going to back Coles and Woolies. All the government will do is ask Coles and Woolies to sign up to a code they've already agreed to sign up to. Meanwhile, under Labor, price gouging remains perfect legal. Coles and Woolies can make billions of dollars of profit, and it is perfectly legal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are getting sick of governments making press statements and announcements that, on the surface, appear to be tackling the cost-of-living problems. But then, when you actually look at them, you realise they do nothing to tackle the systemic crises that we're facing. People are sick of these bandaid answers to real structural crises that we are facing. People are sick of seeing Labor tinker around the edges when they know that, when they turn up next week, even after this code has been implemented, the prices will still be exactly the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens put the price gouging of the supermarkets and their profiteering onto the agenda, and the Greens led Senate inquiry said that there are a number of things that we need to do. This was one of them, but you've got to do the other things as well. Otherwise, the supermarkets will keep price gouging. You have to do what other countries around the world have done, which is to say to Coles, Woolies and the big supermarkets, 'If you keep abusing people and abusing your market power, we're going to break you up.' It's time to break up the big supermarkets, stop their price gouging and make price gouging illegal. But, to do that, you need to put some teeth into our laws—not make the supermarkets sign up to a code of conduct they've already agreed to sign up to anyway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, this place has a choice. The politicians in government need to decide. Are they going to back the public interest, or are they going to back vested interests and corporate interests? The Prime Minister and those in government are all too happy to get their photos taken standing next to these big supermarket chains, to use them for photo ops, to have them at their fundraisers and to take donations. But, when asked to make price gouging or profiteering illegal, they won't do it. Labor is letting Coles and Woolies continue to price gouge and make massive profits. Labor does not tax them fairly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result, people are suffering. If Labor think that their announcement today to do something that the supermarkets had already agreed to do anyway is going to satisfy people who are struggling to make their groceries add up at the same time as paying their mortgage or rent or thinking about how they're going to put braces on their kids because Labor won't put dental into Medicare, then they've got another think coming. People know the system is broken at the moment. It is certainly working for the supermarkets. It's certainly working for Coles. The system is working for Coles. The system is working for Woolies. The system is working for Labor, for Liberals, for politicians, but it is not working for the people. This place needs to make price gouging illegal. We need to stop the profiteering and we need to do it today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Competition, Charities and Treasury, Assistant Minister for Employment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  Australia's supermarket sector is among the most concentrated in the world. Woolworths, Coles and Aldi between them have a market share of 75 per cent. That is a considerably higher market share than in many other advanced countries and it warrants appropriate scrutiny. That's why, for this government, scrutiny of the supermarket sector has been such a high priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I announced the first results of the CHOICE quarterly price-monitoring exercise. The federal government has funded CHOICE, to the tune of $1.1 million, to carry out quarterly price monitoring in every state and territory. That revealed significant price differences—differences across jurisdictions, differences between supermarkets. It showed that in the two jurisdictions where Aldi doesn't operate, in Tasmania and the Northern Territory, shoppers are paying higher prices for groceries. And it showed the magnitude of the gaps between the different supermarkets. That's tangible information in the hands of consumers, which wouldn't have been there were it not for this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also announced an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry into the supermarkets, looking at issues such as loyalty card discounts in order to ensure that shoppers get the best deal. We understand that one of the big impacts of concentration can be on consumers, and so this ACCC deep dive, the interim results of which will be reported in August, is a part of what we're doing to ensure that shoppers get a fair deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the big stories we've heard is the impact on suppliers. In economic jargon we not only know that large firms can exercise monopoly power on their consumers but we also know they can exercise monopsony power on their suppliers. As one farmer said of the grocery majors: 'We're at the mercy of them. We're price takers.' We've heard too many troubling tales about suppliers to the major supermarkets not getting a fair crack, about those suppliers being unwilling to make complaints because of a fear of reprisals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the former government, the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct was set up as a voluntary code, without appropriate penalties. We've had the Leader of the Nationals out there this morning saying: 'Dearie, dearie me! Why didn't the government move to make it mandatory?' Well, we have. We've done what they failed to do in nine long years in government. Not only did they set it up as a voluntary code, they held a review and the former government decided, after their review, that it should continue to be a voluntary code. That changes today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside the minister for agriculture, Senator Watt, and Craig Emerson, we stood at the Dickson shops this morning—it was minus two degrees, a beautiful Canberra morning—to announce that the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct would be made mandatory. That follows an extensive review by Craig Emerson, one of Australia's best policy economists, who engaged in 65 bilateral meetings, four roundtables, accepted 68 submissions and ultimately made 11 recommendations, which the Australian government will accept. The most important of those is that the food and grocery code be made mandatory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it also talks about the scope of that Food and Grocery Code of Conduct. Right now it covers Woolworths, with an estimated 2024 revenue of $50 billion; Coles, with an estimated 2024 revenue of $38 billion; Aldi, with an estimated 2024 revenue of $11 billion; and Metcash, an estimated 2024 revenue of $9 billion. It will probably soon apply to Costco, with an estimated revenue this year of $4.6 billion, not far shy of the $5 billion threshold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Emerson review also recommended the code place greater emphasis on addressing the fear of retribution by including protection against retribution in the purpose of the code, and by requiring that any incentive schemes and payments that apply to a supermarket's buying teams and category managers are consistent with the purpose of the code. Another recommendation of the Emerson review is that an anonymous complaints mechanism be established to enable suppliers and any other market participants to raise issues directly with the ACCC. The Emerson review recommended, and the government has accepted, that the code should provide parties with avenues for mediation and arbitration to resolve disputes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's important about the work that Dr Emerson did is that the government does not have constitutional authority to mandate mediation. And Dr Emerson engaged directly with Woolworths, Coles, Aldi and Metcash, who have all agreed in principle to be bound by a decision of their code mediator to award compensation of up to $5 million where agreed by a supplier. The review recommends a code supervisor who produces annual reports on disputes and the results of the confidential supplier survey. And it recommends particular remedies to address issues relating to fresh produce such that grocery supply agreements include the basis for determining prices and that fresh produce standards and specifications be reasonable. Under the code, the maximum penalties become the highest of any industry code: the greatest of $10 million or three times the benefit from the contravening conduct, or, if you can't determine the benefit, 10 per cent of turnover in the preceding 12 months. This is a code with teeth. Alongside this, the government will continue to focus on issues affecting suppliers through the ACCC inquiry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now we've had the Nationals and the Greens teaming up in an unusual left-right dance, to suggest that there should be divestiture powers. As Dr Emerson said in our press conference this morning, having looked carefully at the issue, 'Divestiture powers are not a credible threat.' The Leader of the Australian Greens has said it's time to break up the big supermarkets. This, coming from the leader of the Greens, is a bit like the message we had from the Leader of the Opposition in the lead-up to Australia Day, that Australians should boycott Woolworths. What both of them forget is that Woolworths is Australia's largest private sector employer. It employs around 200,000 Australians. And those people's jobs would be in jeopardy if this reckless plan were pursued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last three major competition reviews, the Harper review, the Dawson review and the Hilmer review, all rejected divestiture powers. The National Farmers' Federation are opposed to divestiture, the ACTU has rejected divestiture and a Senate Economics Legislation Committee in 2015 found:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Evidence has not demonstrated that the potential advantages of such a power would outweigh the likely disadvantages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The committee is concerned that court-ordered divestiture would risk significant disruption and economic damage, with unpredictable consequences for competition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that the government is focused on solutions which will deliver a fair deal for families and a fair deal for farmers. We are concentrating on getting price information into the hand of consumers. We're focused on resetting the relationship between farmers, suppliers and the big supermarkets. We recognise the market power concerns, and our focus within the competition portfolio is squarely on the cost of living. That's why we have announced the biggest shake-up of Australia's merger laws in half a century. It's why we've announced that we're focusing on the issue of non-compete clauses, which constrain one in five Australian workers from moving to a better job. It's why we're revitalising the National Competition Policy, which, over the course of the 1990s, delivered some $5,000 a year to the typical Australian household through practical, sensible competition reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House understand that the last couple of decades for Australia have seen an increase in market concentration and seen an increase in mark-ups. We've seen a decline in job-switching and seen a fall in the creation rate of employing start-up firms. We recognise that the decade in which the coalition was in office was one of the worst periods of productivity growth in the post-war era, and a lack of focus on competition may well be one of the issues behind that. We are focused on ensuring that the Australian economy becomes more competitive and more dynamic—a message which came out strongly from the House Economics Committee report, chaired so ably by the member for Fraser, Daniel Mulino. That report made a series of recommendations—not including divestiture, I must add—which will focus on ensuring that we get a more competitive and dynamic economy. Competition means better prices for consumers, better wages for workers, a better deal for farmers and a more dynamic, productive Australian economy. That is what this government is focused on.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—This bill was referred to the committee by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator the Hon. Murray Watt, on 3 June. The bill prohibits the export of live sheep by sea from Australia to all overseas markets on or after 1 May 2028. It also authorises assistance to help the sheep industry transition from the live export trade. This assistance can support sheep producers and supply chain businesses by developing greater sheepmeat-processing capacity in Australia and by exploring and developing market opportunities for Australian sheep products in domestic and international markets. The bill fulfils the government's election promise to end the live export of sheep by sea, while providing time and money for the orderly transition to new avenues of production and trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recognises the concerns raised by sheep producers and businesses about the transition period. Nonetheless, given the limited size of the export market relative to the sheep industry, the committee is persuaded that the negative impacts resulting from transition can be successfully mitigated with targeted support. The committee welcomes the provisions of the bill to support the wellbeing of those most directly impacted and remains hopeful for continued engagement with industry to advise on additional or alternative measures to support the transition. The committee's report recommends that the bill be passed. The committee has also recommended that the government consider making additional funding available to support this transition, potentially through the 2026 stocktake of industry progress. The committee's final recommendation is that the Australian government continue to seek opportunities to work with the all-important Western Australian government to refine and implement the transition support package. It is important that the Commonwealth and state governments work together to ensure the transition is successful and smooth for those affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee acknowledges the strongly held views on both sides of this policy debate. Indeed, it does run deep for most people who are involved with this and people who displayed that passion whilst we conducted this inquiry. Most of the evidence received by the committee related to the policy ban on live sheep exports rather than the detail of the bill. The evidence was collected during this inquiry. It highlights the deep concerns that many Australians have about the impact of the bill on their livelihood, on businesses and on rural communities across Western Australia. The committee was moved by the passionate testimony provided by farmers, producers and communities. We were also moved by the passionate testimony provided by animal welfare groups. However, during the inquiry, it became clear that, to meet the expectations of the broader Australian community about animal welfare, the live export of sheep by sea must end. An overwhelming majority of the contributions expressed strong support for passage of the bill. Furthermore, a majority of the committee agreed that the live export of sheep by sea presents inherent risks to animal welfare that can only be overcome by this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to conclude with some words of thanks to all of those who contributed to this inquiry. The committee received over 13,000 contributions from across Australia that represented a range of perspectives. In particular, I would like to thank the individuals at the Muresk Institute in regional Western Australia for hosting the committee at the public hearing. There were close to 2,000 farmers, community members and industry stakeholders who attended the Muresk public hearing. They engaged respectfully with the committee and showed their support to those giving evidence. I would sincerely like to thank all of those people who turned out in Muresk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to thank my fellow committee members for their diligence and hard work during the inquiry and their contributions to the report. Of course, I would also like to thank our secretariat, ably led by Fran Denny. The work that they have ploughed through in the last couple of weeks has been quite remarkable, and I sincerely thank them for pulling the report together and working through all of the evidence and submissions. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="198084" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  by leave—I also rise to speak on the report of the House Standing Committee on Agriculture into the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024 and to present the dissenting report from the coalition members of the committee. I'll start by echoing the chair's sentiments, thanking the secretariat for the work that they did in the impossibly short timeframe that was given to them by the government. It was only three weeks ago, I think, that the Deputy Leader and Leader of the Nationals stood up here and moved that we hold an inquiry into this bill and that the reporting date be 9 October, which would have made a far more sensible and useful report that would have got to the bottom of this particular legislation and the impact that it was going to have on the Western Australian farming communities. I thank my coalition colleagues who are here, particularly the Western Australians, the members who sat on the committee and also the member for Grey, who represents a significant sheep-producing area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the course of its hearings, the committee heard overwhelming evidence that this legislation was going to have a dramatic and devastating impact on livestock industries across Western Australia. We heard not just from sheep producers and people who export live sheep but also from people who produce sheep for the local processing market, whose returns will be dramatically impacted. We heard from the southern cattle producers, whose market in co-shipments to the Middle East will be impacted. We heard from the northern cattle trade, who do not trust this government when they say that the cattle industry will be safe from the predations of the animal welfare lobbyists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those animal welfare lobbyists that have been working very closely with the government on this bill have made it clear that live cattle is next. We heard evidence from Will Evans from the NT Cattlemen's Association that former Labor agriculture minister Ludwig gave a commitment in 2011 that the live export of cattle to South-East Asia would not be touched, and the following day he closed that industry down. We now know that the Federal Court found that $600 million worth of damage was inflicted on the industry in that very short period of time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard about the animal welfare impacts. We heard some evidence from a vet who had worked on the boats between 2001 and 2011, who gave some very damning evidence to the committee on the conditions on the boats. We also heard evidence from vets who are currently working on the boats—and since 2018, when there were dramatic changes to the conditions on the boats, which have led to much better animal welfare outcomes. Indeed, Dr Adrian Baker, a vet who has just returned from a trip overseas, said that they are now floating feedlots, which are designed so that sheep gain weight during the voyage. It's part of getting them fat enough for processing, and they are kept in very good conditions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard from local government authorities—the great southern shires, Kristy D'Aprile, and NEWROC, the northern wheatbelt shires—that the impact on communities, particularly the smaller communities, with the loss of shearing teams, trucking contractors and sheep-handling contractors, would be devastating. This evidence apparently didn't move the committee at all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I submitted 52 questions on notice to the department of agriculture regarding the cash-for-cruelty scandal. For many Western Australian farmers, this is pivotal to this issue. Evidence has been quoted on the public record—indeed I have tabled some of that evidence in this place—around the payments that were made to the whistleblower, which precipitated this entire issue. The reason we're standing here today, discussing this report, stems from that incident in 2017. We got a one-paragraph response from the department of agriculture, which continues what I believe to be the dereliction of their duty to respond to Western Australian farmers about how this particular case unfolded and whether there is any truth to the claim that considerable amounts of cash changed hands. Animals Australia have denied this. They have publicly denied that cash changed hands, but it would appear that evidence through a statutory declaration from Ms Lyn White of Animals Australia would contradict that public statement. That evidence was ignored by the committee. The government members made every effort to keep that evidence off the public record. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll conclude by saying that the coalition members—and I thank them for their hard work in putting together the dissenting report—have recommended that this bill not be supported. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 2 is that, if the government uses its numbers to pass the bill in this House, a comprehensive inquiry into this bill be undertaken by the relevant Senate committee to hear from all impacted communities in Western Australia, like members of the industry, those in the supply chain and radical animal activists—give them their say. Consider all the costs and benefits of the impact of the bill and do not report before December 2024, to allow adequate time for a Senate inquiry to gather all the evidence and make a recommendation to the parliament that is robust, sound and can be taken seriously by this place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the original bill, the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024. This bill will see the export of live sheep by sea end on 1 May 2028, delivering on our election commitment from not just one but two elections now to phase out this trade in a considered and orderly way. Australians expect Australia to have the world's best animal welfare practices, and Novocastrians do too. I have received thousands of emails from constituents advocating for an end to live sheep export. Like me, they have seen the confronting and distressing footage on board ships like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awas</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">i Express</span> in 2018 and the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Bahija</span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span> earlier this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two weeks into its journey to Jordan, the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Bahija</span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span>, laden with live sheep, was turned back due to the increased risk of Houthi rebel attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea. With sheep still onboard, the ship remained moored off the coast of Perth while the exporters sought permission to re-export the sheep to Jordan. The sheep suffered for five weeks in filthy, hot conditions, leading to acute stress, high respiratory illness rates and death before eventually being taken off the ship. Tragically, this level of suffering is not isolated to this incident. Sheep frequently spend weeks and months at sea onboard ships in scorching temperatures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Both the RSPCA and the Australian Veterinary Association have observed that conditions on board live export ships are frequently unacceptable. Ships have been found lacking in adequate ventilation with sheep unable to sit, sometimes drowning in their own filthy excrement, their carcasses flung overboard. When they reach their destination, we have little or no control over how those sheep are treated. We've seen the footage of sheep with their legs bound together, dragged alive across concrete before being put in the back of cars and taken away for slaughter in conditions that are unknown and against Australian regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Both the industry and the opposition know that this trade is cruel and indeed unnecessary. It was the industry that announced a three-month pause in trade during the Northern Hemisphere summer, following the release of the shocking images onboard the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awa</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">si Express</span>. It was the now opposition that implemented a summer moratorium on exports—a recommendation of their own McCarthy review, which found unacceptable heat stress for sheep occurred during those Northern Hemisphere summer months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also the Moss review, commissioned by the member for Maranoa—who is, unfortunately, no longer in the chamber but was the then agricultural minister. That review found there had been a catastrophic failure to regulate the live animal export industry. The review also found that the culture of fear within the department of agriculture meant staff were not reporting their concerns about animal welfare within the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is the statement of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Farrer, that is the most telling. In 2018 she introduced a private member's bill to end the live sheep trade and expose the hypocrisy of the coalition's position. She told the parliament:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I know all the arguments that are used to support the live sheep trade because I ran them myself for 15 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have researched the science, the facts, the economics and the opinions. I have not allowed emotions to overcome reason.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The case for continuing long-haul live sheep exports fails on both economic and animal welfare grounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was not alone in her criticisms; she was joined by a number of her conservative colleagues, including the now shadow minister for community safety, migrant services and multicultural affairs, Senator Sarah Henderson. They had a lot to say in support of shutting down the live sheep trade in 2018, so I look forward to their support of Labor's bill today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government supports strong animal welfare standards, and we know Australians do too. They have told us they want an end to this cruel trade. Almost 44,000 people have signed a parliamentary petition to legislate an end to live sheep exports, and each one of us is hearing the same from communities—that they expect this to happen too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a mandate from Australians—including Western Australia, home to most of the live sheep export industry. It was here that the RSPCA found that 71 per cent of people support an end to live sheep exports, with 72 per cent in metro areas and 69 per cent in regional areas. Australians have told this government what they want, and we have listened. This bill reflects our nation's values of compassion and ethical treatment of animals as well as ethical trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also reflects our care for the community. We know that for some in the industry this will be a big change, and that's why we're taking the time to ensure a transition is done in an orderly way and with care. We can't end live sheep exports immediately because we know some people's livelihoods depend on it. We've just heard from the member for Paterson and about the inquiry that's just taken place. That's why we're charting a way forward with a $107 million transition package over five years to assist sheep producers and the supply chain, particularly in Western Australia, to capitalise on existing and emerging opportunities—such as the expansion of the packaged chilled and frozen sheepmeat export industry—and Australian abattoirs and packing facilities to support this trade. We know chilled and frozen sheepmeat exports are already worth 58 times the live sheep trade, and expansion in this industry means more jobs for Australians and more profit for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's transition package will be available to help all parts of the sheep industry supply chain, from farmers to truckies to shearers and processors. This is a comprehensive package that will strengthen supply chains, expand market opportunities and improve animal welfare outcomes. I also note the recommendations of the report that was published last week and tabled in the House just now. This government will be considering those recommendations very carefully.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the Albanese Labor government has made the right call to put an end to this cruel and unnecessary trade. We are taking decisive action that is long overdue, and we are doing so in a sensible and reasonable way to ensure impacted communities are well positioned, resilient and ready when the trade ends in 2028. I'm proud to be part of a government taking this important step, and we know Australians are behind us.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWN" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  I rise today to speak in opposition to the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024. I listened to some of the debate on the other side. I've been around for a while, and it always seems to be that when people want to make improvements it always impacts on someone else; it's never their constituents. I'm one of a few people in this House that's actually had quite considerable experience in raising and farming sheep. Indeed, I have spent most of my life working in the sheep industry. I've got to say, looking after sheep is not easy. They are an animal that requires a high level of management and care. I've been listening to some of the debates, and I know the member for Paterson, who's one of the more practical members on the other side—it must be sticking in her throat having to toe the party line on this, because I'm sure there are constituents in Paterson who would not be happy with this line of legislation that's going through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I listened to the member for Newcastle, we're going back into ancient history in picking out some of the disasters that have happened in the past and also the worst-case scenario at the other end. Whereas, in recent years, there have been considerable improvements to the transportation by sea with the facilities on board, the monitoring by veterinary staff, the air conditioning, the flow of air and the close scrutiny of the welfare of those sheep, including the diet that they're fed. So, in actual fact, during their passage on the water, the sheep actually improve in condition. They actually put on weight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you from experience, if a sheep is stressed or they're in an area that is uncomfortable, they will not put on weight. They talk about canaries in the coalmine. Sheep quite often fit that role because, if things aren't going well, it shows up in their health. These ships, now, are world class and better than anywhere else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the other end, some of our markets now have abattoirs set up that meet the cultural requirements of our customers. In this debate, we seem to have forgotten about our customers, the people who rely on it for a couple of reasons, whether it's cultural or the fact that they live in an area where they rely on freshly killed meat—the refrigeration or electricity might not be as reliable or indeed present. These people rely on being able to purchase healthy sheep to be slaughtered in a culturally sensitive manner that meets their requirements and also provide the necessary protein and nutrition for their family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Australia stops this trade, we're going to see sheep from other countries, notably probably African countries, where there are no requirements. If we're looking for welfare outcomes, does not a sheep from Africa require the same amount of welfare as one from here? There's a big difference. Then, if we go into the producers—I happen to have been here under the Gillard-Rudd era when Senator Ludwig, overnight, pulled the live cattle trade from Indonesia, and the devastation that was felt from that decision is still being felt in the cattle industry. I live in New South Wales, a long way from where those cattle were exported from, and the flow-on effect to the markets in the southern eastern states was dramatic. Not to mention, the welfare of the cattle that were left with no market to go to—you've got to understand that livestock production is continually moving forward and continually revolving. You can't just stop the production line, because you would end up with people being overstocked and with real welfare conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision for Western Australian sheep producers is absolutely catastrophic, particularly for those who have no other option, because of the landscape where they live, but to run sheep. This market has been a valuable market for them to sell their cast sheep as they make way for younger sheep or lambs coming through. It affects whole communities—the shearers, the truck drivers, the livestock agents, the feedlot operators near the port and all the people who work in that sector. I'm sure the member for Fremantle is very concerned about the employment of the people who work in this trade in his electorate. They will have that ripped out from under them as well. The flow-on effect, beyond the sphere of people who are directly impacted, goes to those communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Country towns are already struggling to keep their numbers up, with the mechanisation of agriculture, particularly in the cropping sector and others. This will be a death knell for some of those communities, particularly in Western Australia. When there are not enough shearers and no truck drivers, their children won't be attending the school, so there'll be a reduction in numbers. The people presenting at the local health service will decline and so on. It's a snowball effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I see this in this place time after time. Whether she realised it or not, the member for North Sydney belled the cat on this. She said, 'Oh, my goodness, the people of North Sydney do not like this trade,' without having one single clue—with great respect to her constituents—about it. Once again, the people of the regions get traded away in this place for the votes of those who live in the elite, leafy suburbs of our capital cities. It happens time and time again. For ideological and political but certainly not practical reasons, we're starting to see productive water removed from communities in my electorate, with the reforms to the Murray-Darling Basin. We see it here. We've seen it in the energy debate, where it's okay for farmland in my part of the world to be turned into wind factories but it's not okay to have them where people of the cities might see them. This is another classic example of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The death rate of sheep on an export ship is lower than the death rate on a well-managed property, and that is testament to the processes that are in place on those vessels, which are world-class. All those people concerned about the welfare of the sheep—where were they a couple of years ago when farmers were struggling to keep sheep alive in the drought? Where's the concern when there are livestock in real peril because of flood? We see concern for animal welfare only when there's a political advantage for some to show their virtue in saving animals. It's only when it's a visible thing, something that doesn't impact them, and they can show their constituents: 'Look how virtuous we are. We've stopped sheep getting on boats.' What they don't say is that they've destroyed the livelihood of thousands of farmers, reduced the social cohesion and welfare of country towns and deprived our customers of a valuable resource. We saw that with the cattle in Indonesia, and it's only now, over the last couple of years, that we've started to get our relationship with Indonesia back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those countries in the Middle East are major customers of ours—people who pay the bills through the balance of trade for the other things that we decide on in this place, whether it's welfare, disability, education or defence. It's us selling things to people and customers overseas that pays those bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    </span>We need to do it in a humane way. There were issues in the past that have been addressed. But, no, we're seeing this legislation come through now to show the virtue of those opposite but no real concern, quite frankly, for the sheep—or, more importantly, for those producers of the sheep that rely on live export.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Somehow, it's thought that there's a heartless coldness in this, that the people who are in the sheep industry are somehow cruel, heartless people. I can tell you, as someone who has been a livestock producer all their life, that there is no-one who cares about the welfare of their livestock more than the farmer. They have been supporting this industry because they know that those sheep are cared for, fed and nurtured right up until the point of slaughter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There might be some in here that don't want to see sheep slaughtered, quite frankly. I can remember one of our colleagues here in the live cattle trade speaking to someone about what we should do with the cattle that don't go to Indonesia. 'Couldn't they stay with their families on the farm?' I think there's a bit of that in here, quite frankly: the belief that farms are places with butterflies and little lambs prancing around, and we're all happy-go-lucky. But the reality is agriculture is a business. They rely on breeding animals, nurturing animals and selling them to an end user. What we've seen now is that the end user, the main market and the main buyer of this product, has now, not through their request, with no misbehaviour of the livestock producer and no real scientific evidence—no scientific evidence at the moment that this trade is bad for animal welfare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll defy the member. I know the member for Fremantle is nodding over there, but the scientific evidence, as of now—we're not going to have a history lesson, like we had from the member for Newcastle—is that this is a humane way to dispose of sheep. If you don't want to see sheep killed, I guess you probably will not support this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  Yes, just be honest. Maybe the member for Fremantle has an issue with those smelly boats pulling up in his river. I suspect that the people that are having their brunches on the waterfront at Fremantle are offended by sheep trucks coming in and loading up. Everyone has to represent their constituents. That could be the case. But, just from me, I oppose this legislation. Sadly, I've seen this sort of thing happen here before. It always ends badly. It always ends badly for the people of the regions, and it always ends badly for this country as a whole. I oppose it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  The Albanese government is taking responsibility for managing a change that has been necessary and inevitable for years—namely, the end of the live export of sheep by sea to the Middle East. It's the end of an industry that has always involved and continues to involve the unacceptable suffering of Australian animals; the end of an industry that has never overcome the intrinsic tendency of this trade to do harm to Australian sheep; and the end of an industry that has steadily and drastically declined over the last 20 years, having fallen now to less than 10 per cent of the trade at its peak.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the live sheep trade has effectively dropped off a cliff, there has been enormous and welcome growth in the export of chilled and frozen boxed meat. Indeed, Australia remains the largest exporter of sheepmeat in the world, and 2023 set new records for the tonnage and value of sheepmeat exports. That's exactly what the Albanese government is working to deliver. It was great to see Meat &amp; Livestock Australia say that exports are likely to grow further in 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is opening new markets and expanding existing markets for chilled and frozen boxed meat. Last year trade to our traditional markets grew as follows: to China, our largest market, lamb exports increased by 30 per cent and mutton exports increased by 70 per cent; and to the Middle East and North Africa, the second-largest market category, sheepmeat exports increased by 63 per cent. Last year trade to newer markets grew as follows: to the UK, lamb exports were up 17 per cent and mutton was up 75 per cent; and sheepmeat exports to India grew by 160 per cent. Those are the facts of the live sheep trade. That is the scientific reality. That is the economic reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's excellent that we've seen a more than 400 per cent growth in humane, locally processed chilled and frozen box meat. It's excellent that the trade in processed sheepmeat is worth more than 58 times the value of the live sheep trade, which itself is worth less than 0.1 per cent of Australia's agricultural output and less than one per cent of WA's agricultural output. Indeed, in Western Australia alone, chilled and boxed frozen meat is worth eight times the live export trade, and that gap is widening. That is what you call progress. That's exactly what's occurred throughout the history of Australian agriculture—a sector that's always sought to become more productive, more efficient and more sustainable. That's precisely the trajectory that's occurring here, as we leave behind a form of export that's proven to be incapable of occurring without chronic animal welfare shortcomings and recurrent animal welfare disasters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, for too long, too many people have ignored and even resisted this inevitable transition, and, too often, they've been prepared to hide behind claims that are fundamentally false. Those claims are as follows: (1) quite bizarrely, that there are no animal welfare issues with this trade; (2) that all the issues, when they become horribly apparent, time and time again, are made up by some nefarious animal welfare or inner-city communist conspiracy; (3) that the industry of its own volition has made every effort to own up to and clean up its terrible record; and (4) that live export is somehow an essential and vital part of Australian and, more particularly, Western Australian agriculture. All those claims are false. They are all false. Most importantly of all—I say this in response to the member for Parkes—it has to be noted that over 60 per cent of voyages since 2018 have involved heat stress in sheep. Those are voyages that have occurred since the changes that were forced upon those opposite. That continues today. Mortality is not the measure of animal welfare. You can have animals arrive in the Middle East that are still alive. That does not determine whether or not they have suffered unacceptably, and the evidence is that 60 per cent of voyages after 2018 have involved heat stress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one ever said that managing change is easy. No-one ever said that managing change can occur without making adjustments that ease the transition and lessen the short-term impacts. That is precisely what taking responsibility means. That's what good government requires. It's the complete opposite to what occurred under the coalition. It's the complete opposite of the approach they are taking today. While some may want to stay stuck in the past, and some are intent on catastrophising the transition that has been underway for 20 years, we're focused on managing the inevitable change to a marginal, unnecessary and harmful trade. Again, in response to the member for Parkes, with all of the talk about the terrible impacts that will occur, in terms of the vitality of towns in Western Australia and jobs and economic activity and other related social measures, how is it that the trade has declined by 90 per cent without those things occurring? How is it that the trade declined 75 per cent just in the decade between 2012 and 2022, and the WA sheep flock and wool output remained exactly the same?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're focused on working with the many sensible people in WA agriculture who want to see the $107 million assistance package delivered constructively and effectively and who want to see support to address real issues—competition issues and processing capacities—and to accelerate the incredible market demand opportunities for a stable, humane, locally processed, export-focused industry that continues to promote Australia as the premier sheepmeat producer in the world not just in terms of volume and value but in terms of quality, sustainability and animal welfare.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weeks ago, the shadow minister for agriculture, the member for Maranoa, stood at the dispatch box and turned on the fire and brimstone in his compelling style. The member—who I like a lot—was happy to trot out some of the four falsehoods of the apocalypse that I described earlier. I understand why, for political reasons, the member for Maranoa wants to play to his own crowd in that way, but it did involve some selective amnesia that was painful to watch. After all, the member for Maranoa was the minister in the aftermath of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Express</span> disaster. He received the Moss review and the McCarthy report. There are some people right now who are trying to claim there is no evidentiary or scientific basis for the very serious animal welfare failures involved in the live sheep export trade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the member for Maranoa is being honest, he really should set them straight. He should quote to them from the advice he commissioned and then received. The Moss review in 2018 stated:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By its nature, live animal exports present a high risk to animal health and welfare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That came 33 years after the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare released its report in 1985 on the live export of sheep, noting that the trade was inimical to good animal welfare. The Moss review made it clear to former minister Littleproud that there was an inherent conflict in the department with respect to supporting trade while at the same time regulating animal welfare; that the department didn't have the appropriate capacity and expertise when it came to regulating animal welfare; and that it was clearly suboptimal to have animal welfare in this chronically problematic trade supervised by vets that were employed by the live export industry. That, of course, continues to be the case today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's preposterous for anyone to deny the reality that the live sheep trade has always been shot through with animal welfare failures. Those failures were not avoided by the industry or effectively regulated out under the coalition government. The coalition government was always inclined to turn a blind eye, put its head in the sand and blame animal welfare organisations and communities that, like mine, have lived alongside this trade, in order to give the live export industry its 15th, 16th, 17th or 18th 'second chance'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another bit of honesty you will not hear from the opposition in this debate and which you'll certainly never get from the former minister, the member for Maranoa, or from those who pledge blind loyalty to defend at all costs what has demonstrably been a rotten trade. The honesty you'll never hear is that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government from the outset took steps to weaken animal welfare protections. They were not just relentless apologists for the worst aspects of the trade but actually knocked down some of the protections the previous Labor government had sensibly put in place. They were elected in September 2013. In November, they abolished the Australian Animal Welfare Advisory Committee. In December, the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy inside the department was discontinued; the department's animal welfare branch was disbanded. This was in their first six months of government. No wonder the Moss review found serious shortcomings in the department's capacity to deliver its animal welfare regulatory function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we are, as in so many areas, cleaning up the mess. Here we are, sensibly and consultatively managing a change that's been underway for 20 years. We made a clear commitment to do so at two consecutive elections. We started the work with an independent panel process that met with more than 2,000 individuals and received 800 submissions and more than 3,000 survey responses. The panel held 96 stakeholder meetings, including 14 in-person forums and eight virtual forums. Following that process, the independent panel recommended that government move to set a date for the end of this trade and to provide an assistance package to support farm businesses and expand processing capacity in new markets. That is exactly what we're doing with the bill before the House. It's exactly why I support it so strongly. The passage of the bill has now been recommended by the report of the inquiry undertaken by the House Standing Committee on Agriculture, which itself received a further 13,000 submissions in a short space of time, with 85 per cent of those submissions expressing support for the reform we're undertaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government, through the careful and consultative work of Minister Watt, is moving forward with a reform that has been a long time coming. For too long, the live sheep export trade has caused the suffering of Australian animals. For too long, the trade has dwindled away to almost nothing, and, for a decade, that occurred under a coalition that wasn't prepared to take responsibility for regulating an industry beset by chronic animal welfare issues and which produced recurrent animal welfare disasters. For too long, sheep producers have made the best of a volatile and dying trade. Now it's time to move forward. It's time to make a sensible and well-managed change to a stronger and more sustainable future. I look forward, personally, to sharing that work, which means focusing on the needs of WA producers and other participants in the supply chain as we make the transition by 1 May 2028. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:19</span>):  I rise today to speak against the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024. The introduction of this bill represents a complete and utter betrayal of Western Australian farmers and regional communities. There is simply no scientific, economic or animal welfare justification for ending the WA live sheep trade. Those opposite are shutting down a valuable Western Australian industry—sadly, for their own political benefit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have completely misrepresented the industry in terms of standards and scale. One example is their insistence that the live sheep trade is disappearing on its own. This is just another fabrication. A submission by LiveCorp to the standing committee inquiry demonstrates that the industry is growing. In 2023, the number of live sheep exported from Australia was 30 per cent higher than the year prior. Their reintroduction into the Saudi market provides huge growth opportunities. I also have no doubt that the industry would be able to grow even further if the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry—you know, that department who's supposed to support the industry—actually did support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Middle Eastern and North African countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, have high demand for live sheep imports due to the limited growth potential for local production. They have a preference for local, freshly slaughtered, halal meat for use in religious observance and daily diets. The broader region was forecast to import around five million head of live sheep and goats in 2022. This number is forecast to be around 7.3 million head by 2027. The growing demand won't go away if Australian producers are forcibly removed from the market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This takes me to my second point, regarding animal welfare. Australia's live export industry has the highest standards in the world. The Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock set out conditions for the export of livestock, and the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System, known as ESCAS, requires exporters to enforce Australia's strict animal welfare standards in importing countries. This means that animals being exported from Australia are protected throughout the entire process, from Australian paddocks to the point of slaughter in international markets. As these welfare standards are enforced in the feedlots and slaughterhouses of destination markets, sheep that are held and processed abroad are treated the same as our Australian sheep. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's live sheep trade is exporting the highest animal welfare standards to the world. This is not just a Liberal Party or an industry talking point. It is a fact that the standards are recognised by international animal welfare bodies. The World Organisation for Animal Health and Welfare have stated, 'Australia has taken animal welfare improvements to the rest of the world, and for this Australia has the organisation's unequivocal support. The live export trade in Australia is leading the world in animal welfare and provides benchmarking.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the coalition members of the standing committee made clear in their dissenting report to the recent inquiry, for Australia to just simply cut and run from this industry will certainly lead to worse international animal welfare standards, with no more welfare benchmarks and more sheep being imported from developing nations who do not have the same standards or, in many cases, any standards at all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important issue that has been overlooked is the impact that this bill will have on our global reputation and our trading relationships. The Middle East is an important market not just for live sheep but also for other agricultural commodities. Grain Producers Australia have indicated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This ban will also have negative impacts on our trading partners in the Middle East who also buy Australian grains, including for feed stock, and our overall international trading reputation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's own Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have confirmed that a linkage had been made by an unnamed Kuwaiti company between Australia's grain exports and the phasing out of the live sheep trade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will only lead to more needless suffering for both regional communities and sheep. So it begs the question: why is it being done? Well, this bill has nothing to do with sheep. This bill is all to do with politics. Labor are worried that standing with those hardworking Western Australian farmers and communities and this vital industry will reduce their chances of holding off the Greens in the inner-city seats on the east coast. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Humanity is often brought up when we have this debate. But where is the humanity for my Western Australian farmers and regional WA communities more broadly? Where's the humanity for them? The message from regional communities across my electorate of Durack, the member for O'Connor's electorate and the broader Australian agriculture sector has been clear: do not take away our industry; do not take away our livelihoods. And they're not going to give up. In just a few weeks, the grassroots campaign in Western Australia called Keep the Sheep has had over 60,000 people sign on to the petition to keep the sheep. The focus of this campaign is to spread awareness of the human impact this bill will have on communities across Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just on farming families, many of whom have been farming families for generations; it's also on the local businesses, the local schools and the local sporting clubs. Those opposite are taking the livelihoods away from at least 3,000 Western Australians but, obviously, this also impacts entire communities spread right across the Wheatbelt in Western Australia and beyond. I recently joined the Leader of the Opposition for a roundtable discussion with industry stakeholders in Perth and, not surprisingly, we heard from the farmers and also the truckies. But an important point made by Darren Spencer from the WA Shearing Industry Association was that, at times, the shearing industry is the largest employer across many of the affected regional towns. Darren indicated that this will have impact on the:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… hardworking people of our shearing industry, including shearers, rousies, pressers, cooks, classers and shearing contractors … The live sheep industry provides work outside peak periods and keeps them in the industry. The forecasts have sheep numbers going as low as nine million next year and seven million in 2026. So we'll lose nearly half our workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the decline in sheep numbers, which is an inevitable impact of this legislation, those opposite are simply taking away the jobs that are simply not going to be replaced with a shift to cropping—which we're already seeing. Less employment means less money flowing into the local pub or the local bakery. It means people will be forced to leave these communities. That's what the Keep the Sheep campaign is all about: getting that message out there of the human side to this dreadful decision. The Prime Minister claims to be on the side of Western Australia. Honestly, he beats his chest about, 'I'm the friend of WA; I've been there this many times.' I'll say that it doesn't take much for him to sell out Western Australia. Western Australians are watching not just where he goes or what he says but what he does. They're watching.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister for agriculture has announced that the ban won't come into effect until May 2028, so there is no need for the government to gag or guillotine debate on this bill, and I hope everybody gets an opportunity to have their say. This bill must be subject to a comprehensive Senate inquiry that will hear from all impacted communities, members of the industry and those involved in the supply chain. I implore those opposite to show some common decency and to announce a legitimate Senate inquiry. The recent charade that was the Standing Committee on Agriculture's two-week inquiry was an absolute insult to regional Western Australians. Honestly, how can anyone justify giving farmers, industry stakeholders and concerned community members just four working days to make a submission to the committee? Honestly, it's a joke, and it's incredibly disrespectful to the people that I represent. Those opposite clearly have no respect for or understanding of our farmers, who feed and sustain this nation. Even though there were only four days to make a submission, incredibly, 13,000 people made submissions. Given that only a fraction of those have been processed and published, it is unbelievable to me that there could possibly be careful consideration of these submissions prior to the writing of the inquiry report. This was simply a box-ticking exercise for the government, with the result never in doubt. I hope that a legitimate Senate inquiry, with a reporting date that allows for a thorough examination, will allow concerned farmers and stakeholders in my electorate to finally be heard. </span>

The SPC product—do I know who grew this product? Yes. Do I know how much the orchard workers and fruit pickers were paid? Yes. Do I know what was sprayed on this product? Yes. Do I know the environmental impacts of this product, including how much irrigation water was used on it? Yes. Do I know the workers in the factory and their families and how much they were paid? Yes. Do I know the owner of the factory and do I know that that owner is Australian? Yes. Do I know this product has the least possible food miles between the grower and the consumer? Yes. I can't answer yes to any of those questions in relation to the imported Chinese product. </span>

Supermarket and government policies are making it incredibly difficult to keep healthy, homegrown fruit on the tables of Australians, and the nation is worse off for it. The Australian product is safer, and it tastes better. If anyone in this place wants to test that, they're welcome to come to my office for a blind tasting.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition have finally revealed the locations of their proposed nuclear power plants. However, this announcement raises more questions than it answers. What does it cost? Where does the waste go? Can you even build them, given that states have bans on nuclear? This policy screams zero consultation, zero thought and 100 per cent ideology—the coalition's ideological aversion to renewable energy. This policy will undermine investor confidence in renewables, delay any progress on climate action until at least 2035 and force Australia to become even more dependent on fossil fuels. The policy is devoid of detail on purpose. It is nothing more than a diversionary tactic to prevent the transition to a green economy. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2024, it is unimaginable that an alternative party of government would not be committed to addressing the climate crisis. The Albanese Labor government, on the other hand, has a robust plan to get us to net zero. We've reformed the safeguard mechanism, we've cut taxes on EVs and we're approving huge renewables projects, because that is what Australians demand of us. This announcement alone could undermine this investment at an absolutely critical point in our transition, and my constituents will not stand for it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

At this year's AG-Grow in Emerald there were around 1,500 companies on display, and 28,000 visitors were expected to pass through the gates. AG-Grow is always a chance to catch up with old mates, but it's also an opportunity to meet with agricultural suppliers and to keep up with the latest innovations in the industry. It is also a social event that not only highlights but recognises and celebrates our hardworking rural and regional way of life.</span>

From wood chopping, horses and animal nurseries to family fun, there's always something for everyone. I was pleased to attend the official opening, where I was able to thank all the volunteers and exhibitors that make the annual event so memorable. I would also like to make special mention of 97-year-old Jean Peters, who has been part of the success of the Mount Larcom Show for many years.</span>

So, if you have spare time and would like to give back to your community, I encourage you to put your hand up and become a volunteer at all local events.</span>

Lindo was established in 1974 with the aim of preserving and promoting Croatian folklore and traditions. It was so great to see the wonderful display of performances by Hrvatska Folkorna Skupina from Canberra and the Croation Folkloric Ensemble Vukovar. In attendance were the Croation Ambassador to Australia, Her Excellency Betty Pavelich, the current president of the Lindo, Dubravko Svilicic, as well as past presidents, including our family friend Mile Dejanovic. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Last Friday I joined Darwin International Airport staff, along with representatives from 12 airports from around our nation, to walk the Rapid Creek Cultural Heritage Path, known in the Larrakia language as Gurambai. The walk includes iconic Indigenous paintings at the airport resort itself, including the 41-metre high 'Darwin Didgeridoo' by late Larrakia elder and artist Mr Lee. The walks make beautiful Rapid Creek more accessible for all abilities, and the information signs provide insightful information about the Larrakia and the history of the beautiful Rapid Creek area. For this walk, the Darwin International Airport recently received the Green Airports Recognition 2024 Gold Award for preserving biodiversity and exploring best practices of utilising nature based solutions in the aviation industry. </span>

I acknowledge the great work of David Kurnoth, who took us on the walk down Rapid Creek, and also his team at Larrakia Nation, including the fantastic Larrakia Nation rangers. Well done, Darwin International Airport. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Last Wednesday more than a hundred Curtin constituents came to my 'Good Infill' event at the Claremont Football Club, looking out over an example of successful infill around the oval. Getting infill right is important for two reasons. Firstly, as we identified in our community driven <span style="font-style:italic;">Curtin</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'s</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">pathway to net zero</span> report, increasing density reduces emissions by reducing urban sprawl, transport emissions and the average size of dwellings to reduce energy use. Secondly, at our Curtin housing forums, the community identified the two top issues as being lack of affordable housing and lack of diverse housing. Doing infill well addresses both. These community led findings led to our 'Good Infill' event, where we challenged the western suburbs' reputation for resisting development and had a richer discussion. There is support for infill if it's done well. We heard from experts about what good infill looks like, with some current examples. Good infill is close to transport, is mostly medium density, has good local amenities, protects existing tree canopy, increases overall green space, is built net-zero ready and provides a diversity of housing options. Importantly, it involves the community in the planning process and respects neighbourhood character. The majority of attendees felt that there was room for improvement in how we do infill to make it more sustainable and liveable. Attendees' top three priorities for good planning were transport, green spaces and access to amenities. Thanks to everyone who took part in the discussion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  Today, I pay tribute to Cam Nguyen, awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in this year's King's Birthday Honours roll. Cam is President of the Australian Vietnamese Women's Association, an incredibly impactful organisation, with over 350 staff and volunteers who help thousands of clients. Cam founded the AVWA in 1983 while raising a family and working full time. She was the CEO of the organisation for 18 years, steering it through a period of rapid growth. The association now has three offices, supports refugees and migrants and provides a range of services, including education, training, aged care, disability care and home care. The organisation continues to build on its strong legacy of helping the most vulnerable in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cam arrived in Australia as a refugee from Vietnam in 1975 with her husband and four young children. She has a master's degree in economics from the University of Cambridge and is fluent in English. She felt a moral obligation to use her training and expertise to help her fellow Vietnamese refugees adjust to their new lives. In Australia, Cam taught at the Australian migrant education services, where she played a pivotal role in lobbying the federal government to build an education centre for the large and growing migrant community in the St Albans area in 1990. Cam is serene and gracious and also determined and indefatigable in promoting the AVWA and its important work. She's achieved an incredible amount and continues, to this day, to work hard to build on that. Congratulations on your richly deserved recognition.</span>

I want cheaper electricity prices for my businesses, my farmers and my irrigators, and I want cheaper electricity prices for my manufacturers. I don't suspect that a $300 sugar hit from those on the other side is sustainable into the future. As a government, we have signed up to global emissions reduction targets, which I think we should keep. We've also signed up, as a country, to the AUKUS nuclear powered submarines. With that comes responsibilities and obligations as a government that we will have to take into consideration in dealing with some of the sensitivities around nuclear power.</span>

Nuclear power is also a zero-emission base-load power. We need to have a respectful debate around why 19 of the most advanced economies in the world—the United States, China, Germany, Japan, India, the United Kingdom, France, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, Indonesia, Netherlands, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and Australia—all have nuclear power, with the exception of us. In the words of the great Colin Powell, we need to 'replace unknowns with knowns' during this respectful debate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  Today, I rise to congratulate a very phenomenal woman in my electorate of Robertson, Brenda Booth, who has been named the winner of the President's Achievement Award at the 2024 Stroke Awards. Brenda survived a stroke at the age of 41. Since then, she's been very passionate about improving stroke care within Australia. Across the country, 30 per cent of strokes happen in working-age Australians, with an Australian experiencing a stroke every 19 minutes, and this is why it is so important to ensure that we are all taking the important steps to reduce the likelihood of experiencing a stroke by visiting your GP and undertaking a health check, eating a healthy diet, maintaining an active lifestyle with plenty of exercise, avoiding alcohol and avoiding smoking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People like Brenda raise awareness and promote effective strategies to avoid strokes. Brenda draws upon her 32 years of experience as a registered nurse and disability case manager to strengthen her advocacy. Brenda continues to dedicate her time to the Stroke Foundation and affiliated organisations on the Central Coast, including as the president of the Working Age Group Stroke. She has been involved with the consumer council, the research advisory committee and the living stroke guidelines. I would like to take this opportunity in the Australian parliament today to acknowledge Brenda's work for stroke awareness across Australia and on the Central Coast. Congratulations, Brenda, on this recognition, and thank you for all you do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Today I rise to speak about a major concern for many of my constituents in recent years—the issue of juvenile crime. Today, though, I want to talk about the gold-standard early intervention that can prevent it. Every day we hear a news story about an armed robbery, burglary or stolen vehicle. The effects of Gold Coast youth crime have left locals frustrated, frightened and fed up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there's one person that has cracked the code in helping these kids turn their lives around to reconnect positively with the community it's Joseph Te Puni-Fromont, the founder of Esuarve, in Pimpama—or Joe, as we like to call him. Last week, I had the great honour of visiting Esuarve, alongside my Gold Coast colleagues the member for Forde and the member for Moncrieff. Uncle Joe and the team at Esuarve deliver a range of programs for troubled youth, providing them with valuable life skills, personal development, and education and employment pathways, all whilst giving them a sense of belonging within their Esuarve family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it truly is a family. The mentors surround their participants with such genuine love and support, something many of these young people have never experienced before. I was so moved to see firsthand the way this program completely changes the direction of these young men and women's lives. Over 230 kids have come through this program, and, with the right support, I hope to see many more have this wonderful opportunity into the future to turn their lives around.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Lebanon is one of the most beautiful countries in the world, and the Lebanese diaspora has contributed much to Australia. But Lebanon now needs help as it struggles to cope with the burden of 1,500,000 Syrian refugees. That is a massive number, compared to the 4.5 million Lebanese citizens. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lebanon hosts the largest number of refugees per capita in the world: 650 refugees per square kilometre. Refugees in Lebanon, including Syrians and those of other nationalities, now constitute approximately one-third of the total population of Lebanon. This is an unreasonable burden on a small country. If European countries took the same number of refugees, there would be 39 million refugees in Germany, 30 million in France and 28 million refugees in Italy. Between 2012 and 2024, the direct financial and economic impact of the Syrian displacement on Lebanon exceeded $55 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The international community must support Lebanon. We need to support the safe return of displaced Syrians to their homeland. We need to ensure that refugees in Lebanon are protected but also that the possibility of a safe and sustainable return to Syria remains open, viable and possible. We need to secure appropriate accommodation for refugees, with appropriate services provided by the international community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Today we mark Global MND Awareness Day, which is 21 June 2024, with all of the motor neurone disease associations from Australia gathering here also to mark 30 years of MND Australia. As members know, global motor neurone disease awareness day recognises the fight against motor neurone disease, a rapidly progressive, incurable neurological disease which weakens the nerve cells and muscles, leading to death. Each week, 14 people are diagnosed with MND across Australia. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great to see so many people wearing blue cornflowers today, the symbol of hope for MND and for the development of treatments and cures. The cornflower represents courage, and a lot of courage was there today, with all of the state associations who volunteer to help so many people with treatment for this incurable disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 30 years in Australia, we've seen some fantastic advocacy. We've seen the memorable ice bucket challenge globally and within Australia, with $25 million raised. And, of course, there was Woz Acott, who rode 800 kilometres on a lawnmower to Parliament House to deliver a petition to parliament. I'd like to pay tribute to my good friend and MND sufferer Jason and his wife, Anthea, who were also there, for their advocacy, and to Sarah and Phil also, for sharing their deeply personal story of MND today. The Parliamentary Friends of MND, which I co-chair with Senator Carol Brown, wants to ensure that our parliament is committed to greater research, awareness and NDIS treatments to help the lives of sufferers by doing everything it can.</span>

Forums like my neighbourhood morning tea are vital for me to meet members of our community and hear their concerns, issues and feedback. This was the first one I've held in Cranbourne, and it was by far the biggest and most active, with over 200 people in attendance. It was great to have Minister Shorten attend to talk about the reforms to get the NDIS back on track after a decade of neglect by the former government. I also had the chance to highlight some of the major policies targeted at older Australians in the budget, such as the $300 energy bill rebate and the 10 per cent increase to Commonwealth rent assistance.</span>

This is not a philosophical debating club at the local university or high school. Decisions that are made here impact on people. We've seen here this week the debate on the export of live sheep—a great debate, with lots of virtue signalling and passion. What about the people back home on their farms, having their livelihood ripped out? We've seen motions from the Greens and the teals to ban fossil fuels, without any understanding that everything we have has an element of fossil fuel. This phone's got fossil fuel, and this desk.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  If energy had an Olympics, solar would win gold, year after year after year. According to the International Energy Agency, for the 22nd year in a row renewable capacity has broken records, with each year exceeding the year before. This is nowhere more evident than in China, which installed more solar in 2023 than the whole world did in 2022. And where in the energy Olympics would nuclear be? Still in the change room lacing up its boots. The race, folks, has been run and won.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Energy Agency predicts that renewables will exceed nuclear generation globally not in the distant future but by 2026. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Economist</span> predicts that over the next 10 years the amount of solar commissioned will be equivalent to the world's entire nuclear fleet multiplied by eight and delivered in less time than it takes to build a nuclear plant. With no sound and no toxins, solar is the quiet achiever.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The market has backed solar because it's cheap, available and everywhere all at once. It's as common as dirt because it's made of dirt—sand. So could we compete with China? We would need a country bathed in sunshine, and awash with sand and a company that makes the most efficient solar panels in the world, backed by a government with a billion dollars, on a disused coal-powered station site. In fact, we already have the ingredients. Let's bake the cake. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Keeping children safe on social media is one of the defining issues of our era. It is an issue of totemic significance right across our community. We're seeing deeply disturbing mental health impacts from social media on our children, especially girls. Imagine if 20 years back we had said, 'We're going to allow young children to communicate with basically any adult on earth about anything at all.' We would have said, 'Well, we definitely can't allow that.' But that is what has happened.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The age of 13 is clearly too young to access social media. In any event, there is currently no requirement on the social media companies to actually enforce those rules. If elected, the coalition will raise the age for social media access from 13 to 16 and require the social media companies to take action to make the age limit real. We cannot let social media companies get away with zero enforcement of the rules. We welcome the Prime Minister's recent statement:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I think that sixteen is a reasonable age. That's what we're looking at in the work that we've done, that's what I've said before …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a welcome statement. It doesn't matter what your politics are; every parent worries about this issue. This is about protecting future generations of Australian kids. We need to come together as a country and get this done.</span>

I was joined by the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and the South Australian Minister for Health and Wellbeing, Chris Picton. This centre is the result of a partnership between the Albanese Labor government and the South Australian government as part of a $92.1 million mental health agreement and also a result of the Albanese Labor government's commitment to strengthening Medicare and improving access to mental health services for Australians. It's partnerships like this that will make a difference to improving mental health access and mental health outcomes in Adelaide's north and across the country.</span>

This is one of 61 Medicare mental health centres being opened across the country, enabling the journey towards better mental health outcomes for all to start now.</span>

It's great news. A lot of people in my electorate are very, very excited about this when I speak to them. The best thing about it was that it was able to quash the complete lies that had been spread by the other side about how there was going to be a nuclear reactor on Bribie Island—quite humorous—a sand island where there's no existing coal-fired power station. Anyway, I think the greatest challenge that we're going to find in this whole debate is going to be, though they say they want a mature debate, finding someone mature on the other side. It may be a bit of a challenge, Member for Mitchell. The other challenge that we're going to have is finding organisations who aren't biased by their ideologies or finding organisations that don't have a vested financial interest in nuclear energy—or renewable energy for that matter. It's going to be one of the greatest challenges that we face.</span>

At the end of the day, they want to have a mature discussion about this because they couldn't care less what energy source we use, as long as it's clean, as long as it's reliable and as long as it's affordable. Nuclear ticks all those boxes. The Australian people aren't mugs, they're not fools and they will not have the wool pulled over their eyes on this.</span>

I personally know a number of people experiencing long COVID and I keep doorknocking people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. Last year's year 12 'My First Speech' winner in South Australia, Chelsea Adams, won for a speech on her sister's experiences with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, known as POTS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These postviral syndromes manifest in a range of symptoms, including, commonly, a feeling of exhaustion; sleep issues; pain; problems with balance and memory; sensitivity to light, sound or touch; and an inability to regulate temperature or weight. What they all have in common is that they are significantly disabling. People are stuck at home unable to work and unable to study, and often they struggle to get a diagnosis, with symptoms that can be transient and variable. But the experience is very real.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I was thrilled to hear that the minister for health has allocated $1.1 million to the NHMRC to develop guidelines for these associated conditions in consultation with patient groups, health professionals and medical scientists. A 2020 study estimated that up to 22,000 Australians suffer with these conditions, and that was before post-COVID syndrome was a thing. This is money well spent and I look forward to the results. Thank you to all of those who shared their experiences with me. This government hears you, and we see you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 1 June 2024, of the Honourable Gary Roy Nairn AO, a former Minister and Member of this House for the Division of Eden-Monaro from 1996 to 2007, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gary Nairn faithfully served his constituents, his nation and his party. As the member for Eden-Monaro it was a service he rendered in so many capacities. He was an engaged advocate for his community, always ready to listen before he acted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gary Nairn entered parliament on the same day that I did, after the 1996 election—though it's fair to say he was riding a somewhat different political tide. Indeed, in his entire time in this place Gary never knew a single day in opposition. As a member of the Howard government, his multitude of roles and responsibilities included Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Special Minister of State. Informed by his deep interest in the environment and community resilience, he worked on water reform and chaired the inquiry into the devastating Canberra bushfires of 2003.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gary was the son of working-class parents, one who had the doors of opportunity opened to him by a Commonwealth scholarship that let him go to university to study surveying. This was his passport to the world, his work taking him to Europe, Alaska, Indonesia and Malaysia. Crucially, it also opened up Australia to him. It was in the Northern Territory that he became interested in politics, joining the Country Liberal Party and eventually becoming its president. He said those years taught him a lot about grassroots politics and people and, vitally, as he put it, about 'the need to stay part of the people if you want to remain successful in politics'. That stood him in good stead when he came to represent the people of Eden-Monaro. As the current member, the Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories, can tell you, it is a truly vast electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gary put in a lot of miles in his four-wheel drive. As one journalist who followed him in those years observed: 'He likes to hear problems firsthand. Then, a couple of weeks later, it's either fixed or it can't be.' Just as he served his community before he entered parliament, he kept serving long after he left. Among his roles he was director of the Biodiversity Conservation Trust of New South Wales and chair of the Mulloon Institute for sustainable farming. He chaired the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in Australia and was strategic adviser for Monaro Early Intervention Services, a not-for-profit helping children with disabilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over and over, Gary made a real difference in his life. On behalf of the government, I extend my deep condolences to his wife, Rose, and daughter, Deborah, who've joined us here today, and to his son, Ben, and his grandchildren, as well as to his friends, his former staff and his broader family in the Liberal Party. In the entire time I served with Gary in this place, he was nothing other than courteous and absolutely committed to making a positive difference, and he had the respect of people right across this chamber and right across the parliament. After a lifetime of decency, service and devotion, may Gary rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:05</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his very warm words. I join him in celebrating and honouring the life of Gary Nairn AO. Gary was one of life's great gentlemen. As the Prime Minister pointed out, he was always affable and worked very closely with his colleagues. All of us had a great deal of respect for him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In many ways, Gary was destined to serve in the Howard government because he was a battler who understood battlers and wanted to make life better for Australians who had been forgotten as part of that battling class. Born into a hardworking but struggling Sydney family, Gary admitted he learnt a valuable lesson early in life. He said, 'You do not get something unless you work for it.' And work Gary most certainly did. He worked as a storeman and packer in the horse stalls as a teenager. He worked at his studies and earned a Commonwealth scholarship that helped him pay for university. He worked as a graduate surveyor before working to establish his own private practice, which grew from two to 20 staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gary's role as a surveyor took him across Australia and, indeed, around the world. That profession undoubtedly forged the future parliamentarian in the man, for whilst surveying the land Gary was also observing people. His interactions with them reinforced his own understanding of the motivations and aspirations at the heart of the human experience. Surveying became a springboard into local politics. Living in the Northern Territory, Gary joined the CLP and shaped the party in many ways, first as a member and then as president for four years. He was rightly made an honorary life member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the battler was set for bigger things. In the 1996 election, Gary stood for and secured the seat of Eden-Monaro with a nine per cent two-party-preferred swing. Testament to his character, his convictions and his connection with and commitment to his constituents, Gary would go on to hold one of the toughest bellwether seats in Australia for three subsequent elections. He was right in his observation when he said, 'I could identify and empathise with the many battlers in Eden-Monaro, and I found they also identified with me.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a true Liberal. Gary saw the value in individualism, in enterprise and in the family unit. He was a champion of small businesses, which he saw as the lifeblood of rural and regional Australia. He knew firsthand that family businesses on the farm and the enterprise of people in towns keep Australia going. He understood that small-business owners treat their workers like family and that in hard times those small-business owners prioritise paying their staff even if they can't afford to pay themselves. That's why Gary spoke proudly about being part of a government that was decent, was honest and worked for ordinary Australians—the very traits that Gary embodied in his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gary's counsel and common sense were readily sought after not only by his colleagues but also by his Prime Minister, John Howard, who appointed him as his parliamentary secretary and, later, his Special Minister of State. Gary was instrumental in securing funding for the Australian Government Online Service Point, the first step towards myGov. He championed the use of spatial data in decision-making and was even called by his colleagues 'the spatial minister of state'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Gary's face was familiar to those in the electorate, his face became one familiar to the nation. As the evening television news bulletin beamed into people's living rooms, coverage of question time would show a dutiful and attentive Gary sitting behind Prime Minister Howard. Following his more than 11 years of service to the people of Eden-Monaro, Gary did not seek a quiet life; instead, he threw himself into noble causes. He chaired the Duke of Edinburgh's International Award in Australia and the advisory board of the Centre for Spatial Data Infrastructures and Land Administration. He supported sustainable farming as a director of the Mulloon Institute and provided his time to several charities which helped Australians, especially children with disability or those suffering from cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A dependable and duty driven man, Gary served his country, his constituents and the Liberal Party with utmost distinction. His contributions to public life were acknowledged in 2015 with his appointment as an Officer of the Order of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that struck me about Gary's time as parliamentarian was that he was always able to acknowledge the good deeds of everyday Australians. He was just a very decent person. The statements he made were a window into Gary's generosity, his grace and his goodness. Indeed, he took time to praise Charlie Sanderson, a retiring police officer, who, in his 31-year career, lead the rescue operation following the 1997 Thredbo landslide. After the horror 2002-03 bushfire season, Gary paid tribute to the courage of firefighters, foresters, volunteers and residents who courageously provided evidence for a committee inquiry. In 1999, Gary honoured the members of the Australian fly-fishing team whose world championship title had sadly gone relatively unnoticed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After his first wife, Kerrie, tragically lost her battle to cancer in 2005, Gary delivered one of the most moving tributes to someone he loved dearly and whose achievements were worthy of recognition. Gary was loved too, none more so than by his second wife, Rose; by his children, Ben and Deborah; and by his grandchildren. Our thoughts are with them today as we honour the life of Gary Nairn. May he rest in peace.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the current member for Eden-Monaro, I know Gary Nairn was a popular and respected advocate in our community, and that was evident through a range of community members who commented on social media following his passing. In fact, he was my own local member when I was growing up as a teenager in Eden-Monaro. He was someone I did see regularly behind Prime Minister Howard in question time on the nightly news.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was someone who stood up for what he believed in, both during his political service and more recently, and that was evident through a range of issues that he had involvement in, in the agriculture, youth, disability and conservation spaces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gary clearly was not afraid to take the bull by the horns, and that was evident and on display when he decided to take on the bellwether seat of Eden-Monaro after starting his political career in the Northern Territory. We all know he won it a number of times, serving as the member for Eden-Monaro between 1996 and 2007. He was also in that rare company of members who are respected across the political spectrum, and in true Eden-Monaro form, regardless of where our community sits on the political spectrum, there has been a great expression of sadness of Gary's loss to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to become parliamentary secretary in the Howard government and was also appointed a Special Minister of State. He headed the government's inquiry into the 2003 Canberra bushfires, finding that a one-size-fits-all approach to natural disasters just wouldn't cut it, and this is something that Eden-Monaro knows all too well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After politics, he remained involved in our region through numerous community organisations and activities and was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2015 for his work. As chair of the Mulloon Institute, he worked to advance sustainable agriculture and environmental regeneration practices—something top of mind for farmers and communities across our region. His strong passion for strengthening our environment also saw him as a director of the Biodiversity Conservation Trust of New South Wales. In 2018, he became the national chair of the Duke of Edinburgh Awards Australia, with a particular focus on empowering more kids from the regions to have a crack and to reach their potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was committed to tackling disadvantage across all forms of life and to building a stronger and more sustainable future, and he demonstrated this every day in this place as member for Eden-Monaro and in the many years since that time. He was approachable, he was community-driven and he was respected across the political spectrum. Gary will be missed by many people in our community. Vale, Gary Nairn.</span>

Gary's passing leaves a profound impact on our nation, and I'm honoured as a regional Liberal to commemorate his remarkable life and legacy. Gary Nairn was a true statesman, a devoted public servant and a champion of his community. His unwavering dedication to our country, his unrelenting optimism and his unshakable integrity inspired countless lives, including my own. Gary's remarkable journey took him from a rural childhood to the highest echelons of public service. He served with distinction in various roles and as key part of the Howard government. His expertise, wisdom and leadership helped shape our nation's infrastructure, transport and regional development policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gary's contributions extended far beyond the public sector. He was a passionate advocate for rural and regional Australia, a champion of innovation and entrepreneurship and a devoted mentor to many, including to me. His tireless efforts helped foster a more compassionate, inclusive and prosperous society. His legacy is a testament to his unwavering commitment to the public service that defined so much of what he did, but he was also an unshakable optimist. He just had this unrelenting passion for making a difference, and you saw that with his work at the Mulloon Institute—his passion for climate, the environment and the rehydration of landscapes but always with community and landholders absolutely at the centre. He inspired all around him to strive for excellence, to embrace challenges and to never lose sight of our shared humanity. His work on the inquiry into the 2003 Canberra bushfires, <span style="font-style:italic;">A nation </span><span style="font-style:italic;">charred</span>, stands as some of the finest work that has come out of this parliament. He was brave, he was courageous, and he carried that inquiry in a way that is an example to everybody before and since. I remember him with his Akubra hat and his sheepskin vest, and he looked ahead with courage, wisdom and insight. My deepest sympathy to Rose, Ben and Deborah.</span>

                  </a>  We do have a plan on this side of the House. It's a plan that has been legislated, a plan for net zero by 2050, a plan for a 43 per cent reduction by 2030. The Capacity Investment Scheme is a plan to drive investment in renewables; the safeguard mechanism that was thought of by former minister Greg Hunt, but which we have legislated as well. We have done that because we know that the cheapest form of new energy is renewables. And Australia is home to some of the greatest sources of renewable energy in the world: sunshine and wind—and the Leader of the Opposition's anger and negativity, a great source of renewable energy that has no end and that is used every single day. We saw it last week, when he made an announcement and then three days later gave a speech to the Liberal Party Federal Council that was full of abuse. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer to help with the cost of living are now just one week away. These are the tax cuts that those opposite said they would roll back. These are the tax cuts that the Leader of the Opposition called for an election over. These are the tax cuts which mean an extra $36 a week on average or, for households with kids, an extra $63 a week. Next Monday, we'll bring five different kinds of cost-of-living help from the budget: a tax cut for every taxpayer, energy bill relief for every household, cheaper medicines, a pay rise for millions of workers on awards and two extra weeks of paid parental leave for new parents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this begins from next week, from 1 July. That's because we know that people are under pressure. We'll see that in the inflation numbers later this week. We also know that some of this pressure is felt at the checkout, and that's why we're making the food and grocery code mandatory. It's why we've got bigger penalties for supermarkets who do the wrong thing. It's why we've got better avenues for people to make complaints and have them resolved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our changes to the food and grocery code are all about a fair go for farmers and families. It's all about ensuring that supermarkets do the right thing by their suppliers and by their customers, and it's part of our broader effort to make our supermarkets more competitive. This is how you manage the economy in a responsible and methodical way. Here the contrast couldn't be clearer, because you don't get the cost of living down in the 2020s by building nuclear reactors in the second half of the 2030s. That's why the Leader of the Opposition's nuclear shambles is economic insanity. It will take longer. It will push up prices. It will cost more. It will create investor uncertainty, and it will squander the vast economic and industrial opportunities that we have as a nation in the context of the global net zero transformation. This is the risk posed by those opposite in our energy markets and in our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the inspired appointment made earlier today shows, our approach to renewable energy is the mainstream view of sensible people on both sides of the political divide. The Leader of the Opposition's view on nuclear is risky extremism at its worst, and that's why it's falling down all around him. We are managing the economy in a responsible and methodical way. That means rolling out cost-of-living help, fighting inflation and repairing the budget without smashing the economy. Our tax cuts from Monday and our new food and grocery code are part of that effort. </span>

I note that the report the member refers to—and they have been referring to it—also makes comments about nuclear energy. They say that it doesn't stack up and that it should be ruled out. It says: 'Don't do it.' As any rational person who's looked at Australia's energy needs and opportunities knows, we have these great renewable energy resources. We have solar. We have wind. We have the anger of the Leader of the Opposition, who made an announcement last Wednesday and then had a meltdown on Saturday. No wonder he's melting down, because one of the things that this reflects is the fact that, since the election in 2022, the lessons learned by those opposite are that they're not right-wing enough, they're not in enough climate change denial, they're not sceptical enough and they're not against marketplace mechanisms enough. What they have done is come out with a position which mainstream Liberals oppose. That's why we worked constructively with the former Perrottet government to make a difference—to put caps on coal, to put caps on gas and to make sure we had the energy price relief plan that has made a substantial difference. </span>

It cares very much about the environment and has seen firsthand the devastating impact natural disasters can have. Whether it be bushfires or floods, the communities of Macquarie have had both during her time in service.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In one week, on 1 July, this government will deliver relief for Australians because cost of living is our No. 1 priority. Firstly, we will deliver tax cuts for every single Australian taxpayer—not just some—then $300 in power bill relief for every household—not just some—and $325 for small business. We will extend the freeze on the cost of PBS medicines, where we have decreased costs from $42.50 down to $30, where we introduced 60-day scripts, all of which have made enormous difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, importantly, there will be a pay rise in one week's time for 2.6 million workers on award wages. We want people to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. In addition to that, an extra two weeks of government funded paid parental leave will be delivered. This is not the beginning of our cost-of-living help and it is not the end. It builds on the relief we provided in our first two years: cheaper child care and energy bill relief, which knocked off three-quarters of a percentage point off inflation. Cheaper medicines have already saved five million Australians more than $414 million.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we announced new rules to make sure families are getting better prices at the supermarket. Our crackdown on supermarkets will mean they face fines of up to $10 million if they break the code of conduct, making sure that families and farmers get a fair go.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, while we're working hard to bring costs down and provide relief, the only policy those opposite are pitching is one guaranteed to drive up power bills—a nuclear plan that costs too much and takes too long, a plan for higher power bills for Australians and a plan to say to business: stop the investment and stop the roll out of renewables. The certainty that the business community have been crying out for will be ripped up by those opposite—the certainty they need to invest in the infrastructure that will make a difference in driving down emissions and driving down power bills. No wonder those opposite are hiding the costs; they simply have no answers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Ti</span><span style="font-style:italic;">me expired)</span></span>

We as a government do recognise that many Australians prefer to use cash and that there have also been substantial shifts in consumer demand over time in how people access cash and how they use banking services. When I released the changes we are proposing to the payment system, I went out of my way to ensure that people knew that we believe that there is a future for cash in our economy. Even as, over a long period of time, cheques will phase out and all the rest of it, the Prime Minister and I have acknowledged that there is a role for cash in our economy. I know this is especially a concern in regional communities, like the one that the member for Calare represents, and also, in my experience, amongst older Australians, who have become used to using cash over a long time. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our focus in the last little while has been working with banks, private sector providers, supermarkets, Australia Post and others to make sure that we continue to keep cash circulating in our economy. The Prime Minister, the Assistant Treasurer and I—and others—have been engaged in this really important question. In that regard I want to acknowledge and welcome the announcement by the Australian Banking Association—the major banks, the retailers—that they have reached a 12-month agreement with Armaguard for a financial contribution to its cash-in-transit business. This is a good outcome. It is a good thing for Australia while we work out some of these important structural issues in the market. I know that that agreement is subject to approval by the ACCC, but on the face of it I want to take the opportunity to welcome it. </span>

                  </a>  That is not a point of order. I know that is the question but, under the standing orders, just as we had the opposition question—'a simple yes/no or figure'—I'm not compelled under the standing orders to ensure that the minister is answering it how you would like. The standing orders refer to being 'directly relevant'. The Treasurer is being directly relevant. He has the call. </span>

                  </a>  I see these three parts of my answer as equally important. First of all, there is a future for cash in our economy. Secondly, we put a lot of effort in to ensuring that cash can continue to circulate in our whole country and not just in parts of our country. As I indicated to the member for Calare privately—and I'm happy to share publicly—we are prepared to consider the proposal he has put forward in his bill. I indicated to him some level of caution and concern about big penalties for small businesses who are already under a substantial amount of pressure. As always, with crossbench members in good faith, we see what we can do to accommodate the views that are put to us in a considered way, as this bill has been. I look forward to working with the member on it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:39</span>):  I thank my honourable friend for her question. Of course, the Albanese government's bill relief starts in one week's time—the $300—on top of the bill relief announced in the budget before last. That's $300 for every single Australian with an energy bill. There's no need to fill in a form and no need to apply. It will apply automatically.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, in the medium and longer term, we know that introducing more of the cheapest form of energy into our energy grid—that is, renewables—is good for bills. That's why we're pleased that renewable energy is up 25 per cent since we came to office. That's 8.5 gigawatts. That plays no small part in the fact that wholesale energy prices, which were $375 a megawatt hour when we came to office, were, in the first quarter of this year, $76 a megawatt hour. This is flowing through, as we saw, in the default market offer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member asked me what plans we have rejected and why it's important to be upfront. Well, we saw the release of what we'll call, to be very generous—in the spirit of good will—a policy last week on nuclear energy. We saw the sites released. We saw seven sites for nuclear energy, the owners of six of which have said they don't want a bar of it and five of which are in states where there is a legislated prohibition. So the policy failed at the first hurdle. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition was asked about the cost of his policy. I was watching: 'Here we go. We're going to get the figures, the details of the cost.' This is what the Leader of the Opposition said. 'It will be a big bill, no question about that.' Well, that was the detailed costs that we heard from the opposition: a big bill, no question about that. The question for the Leader of the Opposition is: how does a big bill lead to cheaper energy? He hasn't released that. He's got the most expensive form of energy available. They think they know better than the CSIRO, but they won't release their costs—although the Leader of the National Party let the cat out the bag today. On 2GB this morning, he said: 'We know what they are; we're just not going to tell you. We'll get around to telling you when we choose.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does all this mean for the Australian people? Well, Dr Roger Dargaville, the director of the Monash Energy Institute, has said that the impact could be up to $1,000 a year on household electricity bills from nuclear. The former ACCC chairman Rod Sims said, 'I think it would probably increase household energy costs by well over $1,000 per annum.' But better news for the opposition comes from Dr Dylan McConnell from the University of New South Wales—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition says that the next election will be a referendum on his nuclear plans. Okay; that's fine. If he won't let the Australian people know, they should vote no to his plans. If he won't let the Australian people know, they can vote no, because the Australian people deserve better than the scam they got last week from the Leader of the Opposition. They deserve an energy plan that can work, and that's what this government is delivering.</span>

This is a question in a series that have been asked by the honourable member which is trying to draw some equivalence between nuclear powered submarines and a civil nuclear industry. The short answer to the honourable member's question is that it will be safe to serve on a nuclear powered submarine. But, whilst those opposite are trying to have some culture war between nuclear and non-nuclear, at the end of the day this is about economics, because what they are seeking to do is economically insane. To draw an equivalence between eight nuclear reactors which will power eight single machines and nuclear reactors, which those opposite are proposing, which are meant to be powering cities—</span>

                  </a>  To try and draw an equivalence between eight sealed nuclear reactors, which will be powering eight single machines, and civil nuclear reactors which those opposite are proposing, which are intended to power cities, is like drawing a comparison between a car engine and a coal-fired power station because they both burn hydrocarbons. The two instruments could not be more different. Those opposite are talking about using the nuclear waste facility that will be developed for AUKUS when the first of those reactors is not due to go out of service—will not need to be disposed of—until the early 2050s. Those opposite are trying to say that we should be heading towards zero net emissions by 2050. The reality is that their civil nuclear power stations will be generating tonnes of—</span>

That is where they have got to with their policy. You want to raise the question about safety? The entirety of the nuclear cycle forms part of the question of safety, so it is directly relevant in terms of the question that was asked by the honourable member. The fact of the matter is that we will not need to be disposing of a nuclear reactor until the early 2050s. They are proposing a nuclear industry which will be generating tonnes of high-level nuclear waste well before that if they want to make any impact for zero net emissions by 2050.</span>

I know that she and her constituents, like most Australians, are great supporters of renewable energy. That's because the energy transition is real and it is happening already. We've already seen a 25 per cent increase in renewable energy in our power grid, and that's because renewable energy is cheaper. It's getting cheaper all the time. More renewables in the grid mean cheaper power bills for Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Chisholm said, we are ticking off those renewable energy projects at record rates. We're outstripping coal and gas projects seven to one, and I have a record number of renewable energy projects before me in the approval pipeline. I've already approved 54 renewable energy projects in just over two years. That is enough to power more than three million Australian homes and, incidentally, it's more power than you'd get from eight large nuclear reactors. What we have before us is a choice between a renewable energy transition that's already underway or a nuclear fantasy that may never happen. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition's plan—if you could call it that—is a recipe for delay and it's a recipe for higher bills. They had 10 years in government, 10 years of chaos and delay, with 22 energy policies. They didn't land one. Now we're expected to believe that 23 is a charm—23 is the one that's going to get them there. It is fanciful. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were told during their time in government that 24 coal-fired power stations were closing. How did they prepare for that? The answer is: they didn't. They had almost a decade to prepare. They did nothing to prepare for those closures. Now we're supposed to believe that this uncosted press release of a policy is somehow going to fix the problem. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been estimated to cost $600 billion by the Smart Energy Council. The Nationals tell us that they know what it's going to cost. They're just not going to share that with the Australian taxpayers who are paying for it. The reason they won't share the costings is because they know Australian taxpayers would rather spend $600 billion on hospitals, roads and schools than on nuclear reactors. Nuclear energy is expensive and is getting more expensive all the time. </span>

As we announced in March of last year when we announced the optimal pathway for acquiring a nuclear-powered submarine capability in this country, we made clear that we would be responsible for the disposal of the nuclear waste, as I referred to in the answer to the last question that was asked by the shadow minister for Defence. We've also made clear that we will be announcing in the coming months a process by which the site will be established for the disposal of the nuclear waste. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point to be made here, as I said in the answer to the previous question, is that the first nuclear reactor which will need to be disposed of will be due for disposal in the early 2050s. In answer to the question of spent fuel rods, this is a sealed nuclear reactor, so there are no spent fuel rods. It does not need to be refuelled. The first time we will need to be disposing of high-level nuclear waste will be in the early 2050s. So, yes, we do have time to go through a process of determining where that site will occur. The one point we have made, which we made again in March last year, was that it will occur on Defence land. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, what we have is a set of questions which are trying to draw an equivalence between how we operate eight nuclear reactors in respect of eight single machines, and how those opposite might seek to establish a civil nuclear industry with power stations which are intended to power cities. It is like comparing a car engine with a coal-fired power station because they both burn hydrocarbons. That is the silliness of the comparison that they are engaging in. The reason that so many differences apply here is best illuminated by the question of nuclear waste, because the establishment of power stations in any kind of timeframe—and which would have any dint on getting to net zero emissions by 2050—would see tonnes of high-level nuclear waste needing to be disposed of in the 2030s and the 2040s. I repeat, it will be in the early 2050s that we will need to dispose of the first nuclear reactor under AUKUS. This is precisely why those opposite have absolutely no idea of what they're talking about. What they need to be telling the Australian people is how much it will cost, when it's coming and how much power it will produce. In the absence of answering those questions, all they have for the Australian people is a lemon.</span>

That is, people are going to be earning more and keeping more of what they earn, because they have a government that wanted them to earn more and to keep more of what they earn when those opposite were voting against the changes to the law for people to earn more, and were complaining about the changes to the law for people to get tax cuts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For people on minimum wages and awards—2.6 million of them will get a pay rise, as well as energy bill relief for every household and a tax cut for every taxpayer. People should have a look at their payslip—the last one they get for this month. A lot of people will have one that goes across both financial years. It will be the one after that, which will probably be in August for some people, or late July, where there will be a substantial difference to what goes into people's bank accounts. If you're a minimum wage earner, the combination of the tax cut and the pay rise means that $38 more, for a full-timer, will be going into your account every week. If you're a cleaner or a retail worker, $40 more will be going into your account every week because of the pay rise, coupled with the tax cut. For registered nurses and aged care workers, $50 a week extra will be going into their pay packets and into their bank accounts because of the tax cut, combined with the pay rises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is how you help people with the cost of living—not by pushing up energy prices with expensive nuclear reactors. You back people's wages. You take action where you can to do something about different prices. But the last thing you do—the last thing you do—is push up energy prices with expensive nuclear reactors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just workers on minimum wages and awards who benefit. Under this government, because of changes made to the law under the Albanese Labor government, there are 360,000 extra workers on enterprise agreements. Take workers at Linfox and Toll Global Express. For almost 10,000 truck drivers and other transport workers, their pay rise will come through on the same day that the tax cut comes through. A standard rate of pay for a driver there is about $85,000 a year. They'll be getting $75 more into their bank account every week. When people are under pressure, they need a government that will back them to get pay rises and that'll take action on prices. It doesn't push them further up, which is exactly what expensive nuclear reactors do.</span>

For his benefit, I'll try and take this slowly. There are eight sealed nuclear reactors which are going to be utilised for the nuclear powered submarines that the Navy will operate. What a sealed nuclear reactor means is that, for the life of the reactor, it does not need to be refuelled. So it exists within the reactor. When the reactor is disposed of is the first moment that there is a need to dispose of high-level nuclear waste.</span>

                  </a>  A simple nuclear reactor that is designed to power cities uses fuel rods. There are spent fuel rods, which are not the size of a can of Coke but are actually measured in tonnes, which will be produced each and every year from the moment that you operate that power station. They will need to be disposed of as soon as that occurs. If these reactors that the Leader of the Opposition is proposing for a civil nuclear industry are to have any impact at all on achieving zero net emissions by 2050, then we are talking about those reactors being in place in the 2030s and the 2040s, which means we're talking about tonnes of waste in the 2030s and the 2040s. We are talking about the need to dispose of our first spent nuclear reactor in the early 2050s.</span>

Labor knows that people are under pressure and are doing it tough. That's why our No. 1 priority is delivering real cost-of-living relief for Australians without adding to inflation. This is not just something that we say. We've already delivered affordable early learning for more than a million families across the nation, and we're ensuring that early childhood workers can earn more and keep more of what they earn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming into government, and since our Prime Minister stood up and said he absolutely supports an increase to the minimum wage, this government has supported not one, not two but three wage increases for low-paid workers, and that includes workers in feminised industries like early childhood education and care. The latest increase from the annual wage review will see 2.6 million workers right across Australia better off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early-childhood workers who do really highly skilled and important work—as everybody here, I'm sure, knows—will receive a 3.75 per cent pay rise from next week. That's because, on this side of the chamber, we see decent wages as part of the solution to the cost-of-living challenge, not as part of the problem. From next week, we're also delivering a tax cut for every single Australian taxpayer. What does that mean for an early childhood educator? Labor's tax cuts, along with the wage increases, mean this; they mean an extra $109 per week back into their pockets. We know that's going to make a huge difference to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also know that that's how you deliver cost-of-living relief. That's how you do it—not by pushing up power prices with nuclear reactors. And we know that what we've done is making a real difference, but we know there's more to be done. I'm proud to say that this government has made an historic commitment to contribute funding towards a wage increase for early childhood workers. Properly valuing our early childhood education workers means that we can retain and attract the workforce that we need to deliver our vision for a universal early childhood education and care sector. Let me be very clear here: only Labor have a vision for early childhood education and care—one that's good for parents, good for children and good for our economy.</span>

I certainly believe that access to housing is a fundamental right in an advanced society such as ours. I know that the security which having a roof over your head gives you is a precondition for being able to seek employment, for being able to enjoy the opportunities that are there by getting an education at university or TAFE or school and for looking after your family, and it's that certainty that is provided. As someone who grew up in public housing, that certainty that it provided for me and my mum was really important in being able to actually think ahead and to have that security. So we certainly believe that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's why we've undertaken, under my government, the most significant housing reforms in a generation. Our comprehensive Homes for Australia Plan is backed by $32 billion of new housing initiatives. On top of that is the support that we have with the second consecutive increase in rental assistance but also our plan for increased social and community housing funding through the Social Housing Accelerator, through the housing Australia future plan and through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement with the states and territories. Our additional funding for housing for women and children escaping domestic violence has been a part of the National Cabinet debate that we had recently. We know that this is a big challenge, and the key to that is supply. We need to increase supply, which is why we've also provided an incentive for state and territory governments on planning, to make sure that increased housing with increased density, where appropriate, can occur. We can't continue to just think that this will solve itself. We do need strong government action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, we have our build-to-rent incentives, which are the subject of some debate in the parliament at the moment, as is our Help to Buy scheme, which is currently before the Senate. We want to help people to homeownership, and a shared-equity scheme is something that's worked very effectively for states and territories. A national scheme will be even more effective, going forward. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I will certainly continue to work, I'm sure, with the member for North Sydney in whatever capacity as we go forward and to work with people across the parliament to try and achieve these objectives. I call upon the Senate this week to take the opportunity to vote for housing initiatives in the Senate. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired)</span></span>

I think she's known to everyone in the press gallery. She's the Gold Walkley winning journalist who exposed institutionalised child abuse in the Hunter region. Her work sparked a royal commission. And, before she was a journalist, she did one of these fee-free university-ready courses at Newcastle university. It's what set it all up. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, Mr Speaker, guess who tried to impose a $3,000 fee on everybody doing those free courses? The Liberal Party. We're keeping them free and we're expanding the number of Australians who get a chance to do them. In fact, we want to double the number of Australians doing them over the next 15 years. That's the difference between the Liberals and Labor. They think education is a cost. We see it as an investment, and we understand that teachers are at the core of it—that they are the ones that make all of this possible. That's why, as I said a minute ago, a teacher on 80 grand a year will get a tax cut of $1,679. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That side of the House has adopted Soviet tactics. They want a command economy. It's going to be all funded; the losses will all be there; the taxpayer subsidies will all be there with centralised planning, which is why they hide the costs—because it simply doesn't stack up. There isn't a single investor, a single bank, a single financial institution. Not even their mates are queueing up to say, 'I've got some money for nuclear reactors,' and that's because it doesn't stack up, which is why they are hiding the costs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:20</span>):  on indulgence—Mr Speaker, can I echo your welcome to the delegates from Bowel Cancer Australia who've been here today talking to members across the chamber about their personal, powerful stories and welcome them this afternoon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Swan for her question. Two years ago she promised her electors in the City of Perth a stronger Medicare, and over the last two years we have been busy delivering on that promise: through tripling the bulk-billing incentive, which in just seven months has delivered almost two million additional free visits to the doctor; through our network of urgent care clinics, which has already seen 450,000 patients—every single one of whom have been fully bulk-billed; and through cheaper medicines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In just the first three months of our government, we slashed the maximum amount that millions of pensioners would pay for all of their medicines in a given year by 25 per cent. In our first 12 months, we delivered the biggest cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the PBS. In our first 18 months, we finally allowed doctors to prescribe common medicines for chronic conditions for a 60-day supply, not just 30. And in three months time, another 100 medicines will be added to that list, which I am sure the Leader of the Nationals will welcome. And in our first two years, we've made more than 200 new or expanded listings to the PBS, giving Australian patients access to the best cutting-edge treatments available anywhere in the world at affordable PBS prices. Already Australians have saved more than $400 million from these measures, delivering real help on cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know that we can provide even more help, which is why, in last month's budget, this government introduced a freeze on medicine prices for up to five years, which will save patients another almost half-a-billion dollars. This cost-of-living relief would be important at any time, but, as the member for Swan says, it is particularly important coming on the back of a decade of cuts and neglect to Medicare, which of course were kicked off by the Leader of the Opposition's famous horror health budget from a decade ago. Along with cuts to hospital funding and a GP tax for every visit to the doctor, this man tried to make medicines more expensive—not cheaper; more expensive—by jacking up the price by up to $5 a script. That's not our approach. It's an approach he's never disowned, but it's not our approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Better bulk-billing arrangements, cheaper medicines—that's how you deliver real cost-of-living relief. Not through a GP tax, not through more expensive medicines and certainly not by pushing up power prices through nuclear reactors.</span>

The Greens-led inquiry into supermarkets said price gouging should be illegal and obscene profiteering should stop, but all Labor has done today is make Coles and Woolies agree to a code they were prepared to sign up to anyway. Prime Minister, how much cheaper will groceries now be? Or is Labor just tinkering around the edges again with a code, that will be good for farmers but do nothing for consumers, instead of just making price gouging illegal?</span>

                  </a>  The member for Melbourne's main job is to issue angry press releases about the action that the government is taking to get a fair go for farmers and families and to make sure that we're making what was a voluntary code mandatory, dramatically increasing the penalties and providing bigger and better avenues for people to make complaints and have those resolved. I would have thought, even in a world where the Greens political party wants the Labor government to go further than we have, at the very least the Greens would welcome the progress that has been made. If they were fair dinkum, they would. If they were fair dinkum about what's happening in the supermarket sector, they would welcome these important steps. And they wouldn't stop there; they would also welcome the fact that we've empowered the ACCC to play a much more active role in this sector. They'd also welcome the fact that we've funded the consumer group Choice to provide the kind of price transparency that we need in the market. They'd also provide support for our efforts to strengthen and streamline the mergers regime in our economy. But the Greens political party are not fair dinkum about these issues, and that's because they always prioritise having a barney with the Labor Party over doing the right thing by consumers. And that's what we're seeing here, and we see that question in this light.</span>

That's what the Australian Energy Market Operator has put in its Integrated System Plan, which of course costs less than 10 per cent of what they allege that it costs, as well. But it's all there on the website, and that was the basis of the plan that we actually took to the election.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Integrated System Plan was in place under them; it's just that they didn't act on it. But we've acted for a 43 per cent reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050. There's the safeguard mechanism and the Capacity Investment Scheme. We're making sure that we provide appropriate support as well through programs like the Solar Sunshot program, the hydrogen program and the program for batteries, which will make a difference for jobs and also make a difference in reducing energy prices.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People who've had a look at this know that that's the case, and that's why, earlier today, with the minister, I announced it in a press conference with Matt Kean, who has taken up the position of Chair of the Climate Change Authority. This is a guy who was the New South Wales treasurer and the New South Wales energy minister and environment minister in a coalition government. That lasted for three terms—for longer than the last coalition government did there, opposite. At the same time, as serious policies were being introduced, they had 22 policies and didn't land one of them. But none of the 22 had nuclear as part of the system. Indeed, even last year you had the Leader of the Opposition saying he was opposed to large reactors. He said this on 2 March as a birthday present for me! He said this: 'I don't support the establishment of big nuclear facilities here at all. I'm opposed to it.' That's not ancient history; that was last year! And why? It's because experts say it'll push up power bills by a thousand bucks. It'll cost hundreds of billions of dollars—at least eight times more than solar or wind. It will only deliver, according to Grattan, about 3.7 per cent of the energy that we need. Six of the seven sites have said no. They can't even get the support of the Queensland LNP leader or any of the other Liberal leaders around the country to remove the ban that is in place. It's even the National Party leaders in places like Victoria—</span>

                  </a>  On Friday 7 June 2024, Senator Thorpe used the cover of parliamentary privilege to raise a number of allegations about me, essentially insinuating that I had engaged in corrupt conduct—not in relation to my work as a politician but in relation to my previous job. I should point out that I had effectively finished up in that job long before the last federal election. My last day acting as CEO of the Northern Land Council was 15 July 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The insinuations against me were made in a theoretical and hectoring manner in Senate estimates hearings. In the course of questioning senior staff members of the Northern Land Council, statements masquerading as questions made imputations which were clearly aimed at damaging my reputation. They wrongly attributed to me conduct which I deny. I have not been allowed anywhere near sufficient time just now to go through the content and context of those denials, but I have set them out in a response statement document which I am releasing publicly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not the only NT female Aboriginal politician who has been irresponsibly targeted in this way by Senator Thorpe. It is not the first time she has made gratuitously false allegations relating to me under the protection of parliamentary privilege. This time Senator Thorpe has gone beyond just speaking about me in the Senate or in a parliamentary committee. Once she had finished her participation in the formal proceedings of her committee, she went online to a number of social media platforms and sent out a personal broadcast of her attack—questioning accompanied by self-congratulatory comments. These comments extended and aggravated her imputations, leaving no doubt as to her malicious personal and political motivation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Thorpe does not respect the institution of parliament and what it stands for, but she is happy to use it to attack people who she sees as her political opponents, especially when they are other First Nations women. What I don't expect is to have one aspect of the system deliberately weaponised through social media in relation to something which has nothing to do with my performance as an elected member and by someone who seeks to augment her First Nations identity and credentials by claiming association and relationship with Aboriginal Territorians. She has nothing to do with us.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:35</span>):  As I was saying earlier, my contribution at the hearing included a letter from Wesley and Louise Hagboom from Dowerin, which eloquently detailed the impact this ban will have on their farming business and the broader community. The turnout at the hearing was incredible, with almost 2,000 people coming along to support the Keep the Sheep campaign. Cars stretched for multiple kilometres down the road from the Muresk Institute, such is the passion to defend this industry and regional Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate that some Labor members on the committee were able to hear directly from concerned stakeholders and community members. But I do struggle to believe that it would be impossible for them not to be moved by the powerful testimonies of those who were able to speak directly to the committee. Former senator and veterinary surgeon, Chris Back, made a great point during his submission: that this decision to ban the live sheep trade for the minister was an issue of mind over matter. The minister's approach has been, 'I don't mind, and you don't matter'. I think that sums up the issues pretty well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important point is the inevitable toll this legislation will have on the mental health of farmers and the broader community. The $107 million transition package announced by this government acknowledges the seriousness of the mental health fallout this bill will have on members of WA rural and regional communities. Unfortunately, I believe the impact is well underestimated. I do not believe any amount of counselling can ameliorate the damage being done en masse to each and every member of the supply chain, their forebears and their future generations. They will not only see their livelihoods ruined but also their reputations sullied, leaving them pigeonholed as animal abusers by an animal welfare lobby hell-bent on ending all livestock production and transportation. As stated by the WoolProducers CEO, Jo Hall:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The mental health impacts of the decision to ban live exports cannot be overstated. As a cohort, primary producers are already overrepresented in suicide rates as compared to the general public, a responsible government should be developing policies to reduce this incidence, not making decisions that add further stress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The announcement of this ban only adds to the pain farmers are currently suffering due to severe decline in the price of sheep, Labor's cost-of-living crisis and a period of drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll conclude by reaffirming that the coalition's commitment to the future of Australian agriculture is iron-clad. I will not be supporting this disgraceful and cruel bill. I'm proud to say that we are united on this side of the House. The Liberal Party stands in solidarity with Australian farmers and the agriculture sector in strongly condemning and opposing Labor's destructive policy to shut down live sheep exports. We are committed to upholding the highest standards of animal health and welfare while supporting a lawful and sustainable live export trade. If this bill is passed by the House and Senate, when we are elected to government—in not such a long period of time—we will introduce legislation to reinstate the live sheep export industry. Given the constant attacks on regional Australia, I can only hope that this will occur sooner rather than later.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  I rise to speak on the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024. Over the years, for too long now, we've heard in this place, and we've seen many images on TV news reports et cetera, that live sheep exports have raised serious ethical concerns. That's why this government promised at the last election to phase them out. We will fulfil that promise, and that is what this bill is about. We said so, and we're now taking action to do so. It's time to move away from this very outdated practice and focus on creating more value, right here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a demand for boxed or frozen meat; there's a big demand, worldwide. We are growing our exports in frozen meat, sending it all over the world, and this will create more jobs and value-add to a particular product that we export. As I said, it's time to move away from the outdated practice and focus on creating more value and creating jobs right here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't have to look far back in my home state of South Australia; we had the Gepps Cross meatworks, where thousands of people were employed. They shut down back in the nineties, when there was a move to export live overseas, losing thousands of jobs. We can recreate those jobs right here at home in Australia over the next few years. We've consulted extensively with farmers, industry experts and the community to ensure that we get this transition right—that we get it right for the farmers, right for rural areas and right for the economy. It's about ensuring a fair go for everyone involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Change is never easy, we know that, but we're backing it up with a $107 million support package to support people in the industry. This funding is crucial for helping those farmers and others in the supply chain to adjust to those new opportunities that exist. As I said, this funding is absolutely crucial. As a government, we've taken the time to get this right, and we know that farmers and other industry participants need time to prepare for the pathway forward. This approach strikes the right balance, based on extensive industry and community consultation. The government's $107 million package and plan support the sheep industry to seize the opportunity for more onshore processing. This means more local jobs and value-adding to a product, helping the economy right here at home and creating jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're determined to build a strong and sustainable future for the Australian wool and sheepmeat industry, and we want that future to be right here in Australia. I'll give an example. Currently, we're exporting live sheep to Kuwait, which has one of the largest abattoirs in the world. They then slaughter the sheep and export to the entire Middle East and other countries. They're value-adding to our product and making money out of it, which is benefiting their economy. We could do that right here in our own country. We can do that right here, providing jobs and value-adding to the product. We want the future to be here in Australia, and we're giving certainty to sheep producers and to the supply chain by legislating a date and providing a well-planned, collaborative transition away from this trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The live sheep export industry has been in decline. It has actually been in decline for many years—down from $415 million in 2002-03 to $77 million in 2022-23. But processed sheepmeat, both here and overseas, has been in high and increasing demand. Every contributor to this industry has been taken into account—and we will continue to do so—from farmer and truck drivers to shearers and processors. That's because we are committed to ensuring, as I said earlier, that no-one is to be left behind. Australians overwhelmingly support ending live exports because they expect the highest standard for our animals and for animal welfare. And by managing this phase-out thoughtfully, more opportunities for work and economic growth will remain here in Australia: that's our goal. This isn't just about meeting expectations; this is about leading with integrity as well. This is progress. This is about creating jobs and ensuring that the cruel live sheep exports are ended. As I said, this isn't just about meeting expectations; it's about leading with integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To those who stand opposite and oppose this, I'd ask them to take a moment to think about the opportunities that this transition will have for all of our constituents, in rural areas and in the cities, and to work to ensure that every Australian is looked after and heard in every electorate. I know every electorate is diverse, with varying views, opinions and concerns. I ask that they consider the industry and those directly affected and listen to the voices urging us to act on this phase-out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can do better; we should have done better many years ago; and we will do better. What I'm saying is: let's work together to get this phase-out right for the farmers, for the regional areas and for the entire population of Australia by value-adding to a product, by creating jobs and by exporting, in a humane way, boxed meat or frozen meat, which there is a growing demand for. I support this bill, and I know that it will build a better future right here in Australia, value-adding to our product.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:45</span>):  I have a great deal of respect for the member who spoke previously, but I will make this point: he's a city expert on a regional issue. That's what I'd say. With all due respect to the previous speaker, this bill—I say this on a lot of bills that we're debating at the moment. with what the government are bringing forward—is showing a city-elite attitude versus a regional or rural attitude. What this bill is all about is city elites saying to country people either (1) we don't like what you do or (2) we don't like how you do it. This is another example. It's getting quite depressing. I'm sure the elite teals would feel the same and the inner-city Greens would feel the same, and, obviously, we're seeing the same thing from the inner-city Labor people. They know best! They know what country people should do. They know what farmers should or shouldn't do. How do they know that? They know that from a TV program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">About 10 or 15 years ago we saw when this first started. This ideological obsession they have started from a <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program that ran a negative thing on live exports. We saw within a few days that the then Labor agriculture minister shut that industry down. It caused great distress to the farming community here and, let's not forget, it caused great international relations problems too, with us and our trading neighbours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a term that's become a little bit infamous, if you like, in Australian politics. It was tweeted—or now x-ed, if you like—by a left-wing journalist, who accused a previous prime minister, a Liberal prime minister, of 'ideological bastardry'. That was the term that she used in relation to what he was doing. I can tell you right now that this Labor Party bill is ideological bastardry. I don't think you'll see that journalist tweet that about anything that the Labor government does or that the Greens talk about, because that suits her ideology. But, obviously, things that the other side of politics did didn't suit her ideology. You'll never hear that term—ideological bastardry—come from her about what this Labor government does, but that is exactly what this policy is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All industries reform and all industries, hopefully, get better over time. There have been—and I've heard a couple of speakers on the other side talk about this—instances where what happened on some of these ships and boats was not okay. The industry admits that. They've reformed and they've got better. We are a world leader in animal welfare with live exports. We have become a world leader. We should be proud. We are proud, on this side of the chamber, about what our farmers do, how they've reformed and how they've got better at what they do. They do that across everything.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But from the elite teal people and the elite greenies to this side—no. They have an ideological obsession—'ideological bastardry', as Laura Tingle used it—about what we do, about what our farmers do and about what we do in the country. I could go on about a whole lot of other industries that they have this on, but I won't. This is another example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have said very clearly on this side of the chamber that, if we win the next election, we will reverse this decision. I went to a meeting near where the member for Forrest lives—not in your electorate, Member for Forrest, but in Katanning, a big sheep-producing area in WA. They were sitting there, about 300 or 400 of them, going, 'Look, maybe if somehow we could move the wharf or the export terminal from where the live sheep get exported from out of Perth, maybe if we moved it to a different area'—that would be an issue—'maybe that would change their minds and they'd be more accepting of it.' I said to them: 'Look, unfortunately, it doesn't matter where you do this. It doesn't matter where the terminal is; they hate you. They hate what you do, and they do not want you to do what you do. You could have this in a terminal 100 kilometres down the road and they will close you down, because they don't respect what you do and don't respect who you are because of what you do.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we said, we will reverse this. I know the member for Parkes spoke earlier—a great farmer himself. One of the things he raised was animals give you really good feedback if they are being well looked after. Because of the reforms in the industry, what happens when sheep go on to these live export ships is they put on weight. I'm a far more modest farmer than the member for Parkes. I know that my cows and calves, when they are happy, put on weight. If they have enough feed and are content, they will put on weight. That is the experience of these live export ships. But do these people want to hear that? No. Because it doesn't matter what the industry does. They want to shut it down because they know best. They know best from social media or media stories. It is just unacceptable. I would like to challenge how many of them have been to a live export ship. I have. I have had a look. I would like to challenge them: Who has? Who has gone out? Who's gone and spoken the Western Australian sheep farmers and asked them, eye to eye: 'Why do you think what you do is okay? Why do you think you should continue what you're doing rather than take your news from a left-wing media source?' That, again, is one of the problems we are having here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go through some of the amazing reforms that have happened within the industry. They don't do live export all year round. It was decided that, in the really hot Northern Hemisphere summer months, we wouldn't export at that time because it is less comfortable. There was improved ventilation, there was automated environmental monitoring, there were independent government observers on decks, there was a system called LIVEX to ensure consistent data was being collected, there were selection criteria at farm level to make sure sheep were more suitable, lower penning numbers and a whole lot of other stuff. But they don't care. They're not interested in the reviews. Their review was half-hearted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I want to end on is what this does to our international relations. In the Middle East, we are looking to do a comprehensive agreement with the UAE. We export now to the Middle East and to Indonesia too, a country close to us that we live export beef to. What are we saying to those countries when we say, 'We are not going to do this anymore.'? We are saying to them, 'What you do is not okay.' This is causing international issues. Again, what the inner-city elites are saying is they know best not only about what we think on this side of the chamber but what should happen around the world. That's unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the perverse outcome of this legislation? This is the perverse outcome: if you want good animal welfare standards, you have just made them worse because this industry isn't going to disappear. There are countries, for cultural reasons and for other reasons, who demand and want to process their own beef or their own red meat. They demand that and that industry will stay. So what's going to happen? There will be countries who step in to fill this void who have worse animal welfare standards. If you are going to be completely altruistic about this, what would you say? You would say, 'We should stay in the industry because we are improving the animal welfare standards worldwide because we're the best at it.' When we remove ourselves from this, when these bastardry ideologues opposite remove us from this, what will this do? It will mean the animal welfare standards around the world fall. So what will that mean for the animals involved? It will mean they have worse welfare than they currently do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the hypocrisy of those opposite; they are not interested in what is actually a good outcome, or in what is a good outcome for the farmers, or in what is a good outcome for our exports, or in what is a good outcome for our trading partners, or even in looking to continually improve the industry. They are interested in their ideology of satisfying the left-wing, inner-city entitled groups of who they are. I felt a lot of empathy for the farmers I spoke to in WA a month or two ago. It was clear that the writing was on the wall that the Labor Party was never going to listen to them, no matter what they did, said, changed or improved. The government were never going to listen to any of that because they'd made up their minds with their own ideology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a very sad day for the farmers, their families and a lot of the communities. This is a big industry in some of these communities, and the sole industry in some of these communities. The supply chains they have, the carters, the truck drivers, a lot of the industries around that support them—again, this is Labor, for ideology, killing off an industry. It's going to have a detrimental effect, which will be felt and already has been felt; other people have raised this issue. When you can't export something, when you have all these animals that were going to be live exports staying onshore, it floods our market. We don't have the processing capacity. They go, 'We should be value-adding and selling them ourselves offshore.' We do that, and we satisfy that demand. This is a market that exists because they want live exports. I know the member for Parkes said this when he spoke: the stock stays onshore, and the stock floods markets over in the eastern states and everywhere else around the country. What does that do? That makes really low prices for people's sheep. What will that do? That'll hurt every sheep farmer in the country because we're going to have oversupply and we're not going to have the processing capacity—and we don't have the processing capacity—to process these sheep.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government don't care. They talk about this compensation package which does nothing for the people involved and won't help them in any meaningful way. It is very disappointing to be up here again talking about how this country is now divided between inner-city elites—the teal elites, the Greens elites and the inner-city Labor Party elites. It is to the detriment of the good people of Australia, especially regional and rural Australia—good, hardworking people who want to earn a living and generate jobs and wealth for this country. This industry is doing that. The government are doing this simply to keep <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> and the people who watch it happy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  I'm very pleased to speak on the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024. There are many issues that the people of Macnamara deeply care about, and this has been one where they have advocated for a long, long time. For multiple elections the Labor Party has committed to ending the export of live sheep because of too many incidents of animal cruelty on the way to a very long and hot journey across the world for our sheep. I've been contacted about this on countless occasions by people in my community, and they have expressed to me their concern of animal welfare standards on those long and hot journeys of our sheep. This has been something that should come as no surprise to those opposite. This should come as no surprise to those interjecting; we have taken this policy to successive elections because, time after time, industry have been given the opportunity to clean up their act and have failed to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was first elected in 2019 I started a petition against live sheep exports to take with me to Canberra. It was signed by hundreds of members in my community. Despite numerous reviews and reforms and even private members' bills from those opposite—I remember that the then member for Corangamite, now a senator for Victoria, Senator Henderson, and even the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the member for Farrer, both had a private member's bill looking to phase out live sheep exports after those countless times sheep were facing the most awful of circumstances on these hot journeys overseas. Even the Liberal Party members themselves were putting forward bills to phase this out. Instead of sticking with their convictions and sticking with those policies, the now senator and the now Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party were both promoted to the cabinet and—very surprisingly!—dropped their own bill. They dropped their own bill because their own promotion was apparently more of a priority for them. There have been numerous reviews and reforms, but my community still holds the same view, that this needs to end and this bill will provide an end date.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently met over 30 locals who came and made it clear that they wanted to see us follow through on our commitment. I went outside my office and I spoke to each and every one of them. They were polite, they were passionate, and they were advocating in the way in which politics should be conducted. I was very pleased to go and speak to them. I committed to them on that day outside my office that I would come in here, into this place, and advocate for an end date to be legislated and I would advocate for us to follow through on our commitment that we made at the election. I'm pleased to say that this bill does exactly that. On 1 May 2028, this bill will legislate the end to live sheep exports. It gives people time but also sets a clear date that will bring this practice to an end. For the past two elections, we've committed to this. It matters to not only people in my electorate but to people right across the country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite those opposite putting on crocodile tears right now, the decision is based on the best of expert advice. The reality is that, despite reforms and despite small improvements to the treatment of sheep during export, the live sheep export trade is simply not acceptable. An analysis of the trade led by RSPCA scientists revealed that between 2018 and 2023 activities inconsistent with the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock, which they like to champion, were noted in 70 per cent of all reports. In 70 per cent of all reports, the RSPCA found that we weren't meeting up to the standards of animal welfare that those opposite like to talk about. That simply isn't acceptable. Sheep were loaded with obstruction to access to food and water onto ships. Sheep with wool length greater than 25 millimetres, leading to a higher risk of heat stress, were also loaded on. Over 60 per cent of voyages since 2018 have reported heat stress in the sheep. The RSPCA said this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The science supporting this position is clear and irrefutable … years of this scientific evidence that prove that sheep undoubtedly suffer in live export, both on the lengthy sea voyages and in the country of destination …</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just earlier this year, more than 14,000 animals were subjected to a 34-day journey from Australia to the Middle East, and this journey was in addition to the prior 38 days at sea these animals were subjected to before being offloaded back in Australia in February to stand waiting for several weeks before departing again in March. That was the single longest journey for animals in our history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's make a few facts clear. Australia is one of the largest exporters of sheepmeat and wool, yet live sheep exports are only one per cent of Australia's sheep industry and exports are 0.1 per cent of Australia's agricultural production. The trade itself has declined 90 per cent from 2001-02 all the way to 2022-23. That's a 90 per cent decline. This industry is shrinking, and it is continuing to shrink. Seventy-one per cent of Western Australians support the phase-out, including 69 per cent in rural and regional parts of the state. National polling in 2022 placed support for the phase-out of live sheep exports at 78 per cent. Of the 13,000 submissions and correspondence received by the Standing Committee on Agriculture, over 85 per cent expressed support for the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our agricultural trade is a vital part of Australian industry. There is no doubt about that. But the reality is that we must do things in the Australian way, in the humane way, and we must exercise our humanity when we are conducting our business. The live sheep export simply cannot provide that and cannot comply with that. That is what we have committed to on successive elections. It should come as no surprise to those opposite. As I said at the start of these remarks, even the Liberal Party themselves, even the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party herself, thought that it was time to phase out live sheep exports. That's why she introduced a private member's bill. But, like what often happens with those opposite, they say a lot and then, when push comes to shove, aren't willing to follow through on what they apparently stand for. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we will do what's right, while ensuring the jobs and livelihoods that are impacted are supported with that process. We have given time to be able to support those who are no doubt facing a difficult time in this transition. I take no joy in knowing that there will be people impacted by this—we don't shy away from that—but it does mean the end to a practice that, frankly, has been unacceptable for too long. There have been too many awful instances of animal cruelty. That will come to an end. We will transition away from live sheep exports, and there can be other things that are taken advantage of. We will do this through an orderly transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people have made it clear that they expect the government to uphold standards of welfare. We don't need the live sheep export trade. It's been shrinking. It has had too many chances to repair itself and it has not done that. This bill will bring an end to live sheep export. It is an important reform—one that we have committed to for the last two elections—and the Labor government, just as we said we would, is introducing this bill.</span>

But I had over 500 contacts the last time this issue reared its head in previous parliaments. I attended a live export loading with the member for Petrie and others back in 2019. I think the member for Forrest was there as well. Mia Davies, a current MLA in the WA state parliament, posted on Facebook at the time:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The overwhelming majority of Australians have no direct involvement in our food supply chain; they simply don't. They don't really understand what it takes to produce the protein that they rely on, how it is delivered to them or what arrangements must be made. But, coming from a regional area and knowing people like the member for Forrest, they love their animals. They don't want to see losses, because losses cost money. No-one wants to lose any of their product, whether it's part of a dairy herd, a single sheep or a single lamb. But every single day in this country there are stock losses, whether it's from an accidental death, a fall, wild dogs, a snake bite, illness, sickness, getting caught in a fence or drowning. This is the reality of agricultural life. For the producers who are putting protein on our table, unfortunately this is a regular event. But the idea that they would stock a ship knowing there'd be enormous losses and afterwards a direct impact on potential profits is just false. It is wrong. They won't do that; it's not in their interest. It's not in the interest of them, their industry, our nation's reputation, the supplier and the buyer. All the people who are in that supply chain are now going to be effectively unemployed because this Labor government has made the decision that they just don't like the industry. That's the reality. There's nothing else about it; they just don't like it. Sure, they've made some other commitments as a government, but when you have even WA Premier Roger Cook reported as stating the federal government's $107 million transition support package for the industry is just not good enough—a Labor premier—surely you would listen to the Premier in the state where the actual impact is on the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at the supply chain—agents, saleyards, shearers, transporters, feed growers, millers, live exporters, Australian government regulators, vets, all the technical science and support, the people involved at the other end—every single one of them rely on this industry to pay their bills, to pay their mortgage, to feed their family, to clothe their children, to educate them, to give them an opportunity. They've taken enormous risks because they've invested in an industry they support—an industry which is actually legitimate, has been around for a long time and fills a need in the world's demand for protein in countries where there's basically no refrigeration. How else do you do this? As many before me have pointed out, if they are not supplying sheep from our country with our standards they'll come from somewhere else. Animal welfare is not on the list of things those other nations are interested in; it is simply volume and value. Every single individual involved in this trade in Western Australia will have an enormous detrimental impact from this decision by the federal government. Imagine showing up in two months and you can't pay your mortgage, because the federal government put you out of business with a decision which is simply about what they believe. It's not about science, the facts or the impacts. It's not about the fact that they're feeding the world and are part of a very important supply chain out of WA; it's just that the federal government don't like them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are lots of other things around. We have seen accusations and allegations from the Animal Justice Party in what I'd have to say is just a disgraceful chapter if it's true. According to the Animal Justice Party, 11 May 2024:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are proud that the AJP could deliver the knockout blow by demanding the end of live sheep export as a requirement for our preferences at the Dunkley By-election in March.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What an incredible statement. Every single one of those Australians who are invested in this trade have been sold down the river, if this is true, by allegations that this is about a preference deal. If this is the case, my question is: what's next? Who's next? Which industry is on the chopping block because a deal needs to be done? If we look at the opportunities, I'm sure Animal Justice has had plenty to say about some of these sorts of things. I'm quite confident they don't support jumps racing; in fact, I'm very confident. Is that the next deal necessary in a by-election or a federal election—the jumps? Are they out there; are they done? What about the dogs, the greyhounds?</span>

                    </a>  There are lots of people involved in the horse industry, as the member for Forrest says. What about the Melbourne Cup? We've seen lots of protest from Animal Justice and others about the Melbourne Cup, something that puts literally half a billion dollars into the Victorian economy. Are they next? Is that the next opportunity? Are they the ones that will be sold down the river to do a deal like this? I can understand the outright anger—it is not frustration anymore—from the producers in Western Australia. They are furious, they are white-hot angry and they should be, because they have been absolutely sold out. Can you imagine any individual in this place losing the ability to pay their mortgage, educate their children and make their own way in this world, because someone, somewhere, decided they didn't like their industry for some particular reason and, potentially, a deal was done and they were out of business? We make tough decisions here all the time, but this one is absolutely unnecessary. We have the highest welfare standards in the world, bar none. Why shouldn't this industry be allowed to continue what they've been doing? Where there were changes necessary, they have made them. They have invested. They have taken risks. They have borrowed. They have employed. They have paid taxes. They are entitled to exist.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the next industry that's going to get rolled? We have members in here who are absolutely against the gambling sector. They don't like pokies, for example. Is that next, if a deal is necessary to form government—maybe if there's a minority government? Is that next? Is that industry going to be wiped out as well? The idea that any federal government, a government of Australia, would shut down an industry like this simply because they just don't like it, I find just appalling. So I 100 per cent support the 'Keep the Sheep' program that they're running in Western Australia. Their anger will continue to grow. The closer they get to losing their businesses, the worse this will be.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And imagine the damage it does to our international reputation—the reputation of this country as a reliable supplier—one that held us in incredibly good stead throughout the COVID period, whether in resources, or in agriculture or anything else that we exported. People come to this country because they know Australia can be relied on: when they put in an order, we deliver. And in the midst of one of the most difficult periods of time, this country continued to delivered. We kept the lights on in Japan, South Korea and everywhere else. We kept food flowing to the world, including live sheep, because we can be relied on. Yet now we have statements from the Japanese ambassador, for example, that there is sovereign risk in this nation, and these types of decisions back up exactly what the ambassador from Japan has said. We rely on trade; trade is an enormous part of this nation, its economy and its ability to employ people in this country, and we must continue to protect it—not destroy it. So I want to congratulate the members for O'Connor, Durack and Forrest, the WA Nats, the WA Libs and the WA Labor Party, who also oppose this and who also say it's not right because it directly impacts the people in their state and that it is absolutely unnecessary.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask again of the House: what is next? Which industry is it that will upset Labor's sensibilities? Which industry is it that will be sent down the river because they need a deal on preferences to win? We all know statements from the Hon. Graham Richardson, the former member of the other place, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Whatever It Takes</span>—I get all that. But 'whatever it takes' shouldn't be at the cost of an Australian's livelihood in an industry which has been in place for a long time and which fills a need and a demand. It's an industry that's necessary because of the circumstances. We don't live in a world that is made up of fluffy clouds and unicorns running around providing layers of gold for every individual. In the world of reality, particularly if you're an agricultural producer, you get stock losses. You do! It doesn't matter if you're in livestock or you're in horticulture, you get damage and you get loss. It is part of the risk of farming. But, in this industry, they've done everything they possibly could to reduce that risk. Will there be incidents? Of course there will be incidents. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of heads of sheep. It doesn't take very much for one of them to fall over, to break a leg. It happens. But we have to accept that if we want to provide protein to the world, particularly in places where there is no refrigeration and no refrigerated logistical transport then live export is what there is.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll come back to where I started: is the cattle trade next? If you're in the Northern Territory, if you're in the Far North or if you're in Queensland and you rely on what is a very import of trade for that area of the country, are you at risk? I think the answer is: absolutely you are under this federal government, because they've done it before. Overnight, they closed down live cattle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've all read the media reports on the costs—which are significant and yet to be paid, if I recall correctly—and the impact they had on Australia's reputation. These are live animals. Regardless of what the federal parliament decides, they continue to grow. They continue to move outside the bracket of where it works for them to be exported. They continue to produce wool. They continue to do a whole pile of things. Ultimately, the result of this policy in Western Australia will be hundreds of thousands of head of sheep that have to be destroyed because they are valueless and cannot be fed. They will end up in a hole in the ground, and there will be more heartbroken farmers, because they established an industry, they took the risks that were necessary, and they did everything right apart from causing an upset to this federal Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say again to the ministers involved: you don't need to do this. Listen to all the individuals that keep the sheep. Listen to your WA counterparts. Listen to the ones who are directly impacted, because it is they who pay the price. It is not individuals like the member for Macnamara, and I heard his speech just before. If you live in an inner-city seat, you don't see most of this. Some of them will come from regional areas, but they don't live in the world of reality. The reality is that these things take effort and risk. If you take the risk, you want the reward. Every single person involved in this supply chain deserves the respect of every individual in this country, because they are providing food for this nation and food for other nations. They are ensuring that we do not have further sovereign risk and further reduction in agricultural production in this nation. I oppose this bill absolutely and wholeheartedly.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  I rise today in support of the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024. This bill is an incredibly important milestone for our parliament's commitment to animal welfare. When I was first elected in 2019, live sheep exports quickly became one of the issues that constituents were contacting me about more than many other issues. Many hundreds of my constituents emailed me to express their outrage after a whistleblower made public footage of a voyage to the Middle East. More than 2,000 sheep died on that vessel. The video showed sheep crammed into dirty pens, panting from heat stress and leaping over one another to access food. Carcasses piled up, with some thrown overboard. Newborn lambs were caught up in the carnage despite laws meant to prevent pregnant ewes onboard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ending the practice of live sheep exports remains one of the key issues that Canberrans raise with me, and I want to thank them for their ongoing advocacy. I also want to thank the many members of the Canberra community who got in touch to thank our government for this legislation. When we were in opposition, in my first term, I was pleased to raise this issue with the former minister for agriculture, the member for Maranoa, calling on him to follow the lead of New Zealand and put an end to live sheep exports. I was proud when, in opposition, we committed to getting that done in both the 2019 and 2022 elections. I was proud to write to our new minister for agriculture, Senator Watt, calling on our government to honour this commitment as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, with this bill, the government is honouring our commitment to end the live sheep export trade. As Benjamin Anderson, Madeline Stewart and Aiden Whitfield, three young people from my electorate, recently told me when they presented me with their petition on this issue, nothing justifies live exports. This bill will prohibit absolutely the export from Australia of live sheep by sea on and after 1 May 2028. This date reflects the recommendations of an independent panel. It provides certainty to farmers, supply chain businesses, the Australian community and trading partners. It will support a more successful transition to onshore value-adding through domestic processing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have claimed that this will end farming in Australia. We have heard many of those opposite talk about people representing city electorates like my own speaking in support of this and not understanding the industry. What I would say to that is that I have the deepest respect for farmers and people who work in agriculture, including many in my own family. I do appreciate the critical role that they hold in our economy and community, but this is about moving on from a particular part of this industry that I feel is not justified. This cruelty to the sheep that we see is not justified, and our government is working to support those farmers and communities through this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite are also ignoring the fact that the live sheep export industry has reduced by 90 per cent since 2001, from 6.5 million head of sheep then to 652,000 head of sheep today, and ignoring the fact that live sheep exports by sea were worth only $77 million last year compared to the $4.5 billion in sheepmeat exports. Ending this trade will not be the hit to farmers that those opposite claim. This is an industry that is already on the decline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is not just leaving those farmers who currently work in this industry to fend for themselves. We have put $107 million on the table to ensure an orderly and well-planned transition away from the trade. Knowing farmers in my own family, I know that farmers are adaptable—they have to be—to the conditions they face. They know when an industry is in decline and when something is no longer working. Support is on the table now so that the industry can start to plan, so that those affected by the phase-out are well-positioned, resilient and ready when the trade ends in 2028.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, ending the trade will ensure more sheep are processed here in Australia, employing more people through the supply chain. It means more people employed in Australian abattoirs, more Australians employed as butchers and so on, value-adding to our economy and to our agricultural industries. And importantly, it means we will have full oversight and confidence that our high standards for animal welfare are adhered to. This is something that many of those opposite have in the past supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw attention to 2018, when the now deputy leader of the Liberal Party, the member for Farrer, introduced a private member's bill supported by Senator Henderson—the then member for Corangamite—the member for Leichhardt and the member for La Trobe. That private member's bill would have ended the live export trade then. The member for Farrer said at the time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The case for continuing long haul live sheep exports fails on both economic animal welfare grounds … The live sheep trade is in terminal decline … The litany of animal cruelty in the live sheep trade makes a mockery of the industry's "no fear no pain" mantra … Unfortunately this is an industry with an operating model built on the suffering of animals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a joint media release with Senator Henderson, the member for Farrer also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our personal conviction on this issue remains and we will continue to advocate for a change in Coalition policy and for a phase-out of this awful trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the cruelty of this industry remains, and the only thing that has changed is the conviction of some of those members opposite, who have seemingly sacrificed those beliefs. I hope they will support this bill because this is an important step we are taking for the welfare of animals in this country. I am proud to be a member of a government that has followed through on its commitment to end the live sheep export trade. I have been pleased to hear from members of my community who have been supportive of this bill and I want to thank you again for your advocacy. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  It will not be any surprise to anyone who knows I am a farmer that I strongly oppose this bill. I support WA's efforts to Keep the Sheep and I thank every farmer out there working their heart out. And don't forget: no farmers, no food. For goodness sake, Labor, for a change, how about listening to our hardworking common-sense farmers and not just elitist fanatics and activists? We know with this legislation that, if you are a farmer in Australia, Labor is coming for you and your right to farm in some form or another, because as farmers we know we just don't matter. No industry is safe when the government gets into bed with the latest outrage elite city based extremist, and certainly not agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are literally biting the hand that feeds them. As a farmer, I know farmers might be only small in population and therefore don't matter to this government but we produce the most fabulous and critically nutritious food that supports and sustains all Australians and many overseas as well. Even worse, what we Western Australians absolutely know is that this is an east coast Labor city elite-focused federal government, dictating to as well as being prepared to sacrifice WA farmers and communities. They are pandering to people who literally don't like or don't approve of the work regional people do, in spite of the over $400 billion generated from regional and rural areas to help fund the very basic services that all Australians rely on. Labor doesn't have to care about us as farmers, primary producers or people who live or work in the regions. Those of us in ag and mining who kept Australia out of recession during the global financial crisis are those who, as I said, are right now paying for the services and supports Australians need through royalties, taxes and export revenues. We just don't matter to Labor. Labor doesn't give a damn and we are totally expendable; that's what we know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has the best farmers in the world, who feed and clothe us. That excellence is front and centre in the live export trade. The industry introduced world-leading animal welfare reforms in 2019 in both the transport and processing of sheep in the Middle East. In the live sheep export sector, Australia is literally world and global gold standard. If we don't support our farmers there will be increases in food prices and losses of intergenerational and hardworking farming families who have quietly, efficiently and effectively sustained our nation. Who do you trust to produce your food? I hope it's an Australian farmer, because that's what we do well. It is going to have a devastating impact on those farmers that are affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all need to protect our future food supplies. I'm asking you, if you're watching, to support our Australian farmers, because right now the Labor government is constantly choosing to support and empower radical, extreme activist fanatics instead of our farmers. If you're a Western Australian farmer you are directly at the mercy of eastern states Labor politicians, who simply want to put you out of business. None of us feel safe, no matter what we're farming. This is a shot across the bow for all of us as farmers. I've said before that I've never been as worried about the future of farmers in my 50 years in this industry as I am right now. We're seeing a deliberate and calculated Labor government approach to directly and indirectly get rid of more and more farmers, and more and more production animals, giving in to those elite city extremists. Make no mistake, Labor is coming after us, one sector at a time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After this, that will mean more land is available for Labor's renewables-only policies. The more farmers that are gone, the more land there is for endless wind turbines, solar panels, transmission lines and our water. Labor is shutting down live sheep exports now, but in WA this effectively means that, in the southern part of the state, it's shutting down live cattle exports as well, because it's the sheep carriers that deliver WA's live cattle to markets. Seventy-five per cent of sheep ships out of WA have cattle on board. We know Animals Australia have said they're coming after live cattle exports next. Labor will say yes to this; they've done it before. And we know that if there is a minority government made up of Labor, the teals and the Greens, Labor will say yes to shutting down live cattle exports, simply continuing to destroy without any compunction the livelihoods of small communities, based on fanatical activist petitions. There are endless attacks on us as farmers, whether it's the biosecurity food tax levy or aggressive and anti-farming provisions in the nature positive bill—it goes on and on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I actually felt quite sick when I saw the ag minister hold up Labor's document and there was almost a smirk on his face. That smirk said, 'We're putting farmers either at risk or out of business.' He is not only openly celebrating the end to an industry; that smile was about the impact this will have on small, rural and regional communities, and small family farming businesses mostly in WA. He doubled down on that with that contemptuous comment at his post-budget address, when farmers left in protest—just as well I didn't talk about it earlier in the speech. What contempt! We heard in this chamber today a terrible comment—that it's just crocodile tears from any of us objecting. Try them being crocodile tears when you're losing a third or more of your income overnight. What utter contempt both he and Labor are showing for our farmers. We've even heard the Prime Minister making a joke about the end to live exports. Is it really a joke to directly cause harm to small regional communities? How disgusting to announce that the government is taking away farmers' livelihoods and then flippantly dismissing our reaction—what an indictment! Unlike Labor, I believe that the majority of Australians actually respect our farmers and value the wonderful, high-quality food that they put on their tables. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, in Australia, livestock is an essential part of sustainable land management in WA. It is especially important in managing land that is not suitable for cropping, which in some areas is around 20 per cent of the land. It's because of our farmers that the majority of Australians, unless they've fallen on very hard personal circumstances, have never been hungry. The food is always on the shelves. Australians know that we farmers are working day and night, in all weathers, to get the job done and to put that beautiful food on the table for them and their children. But, without the help of Australians, we can't fight a Labor government that's hell-bent on putting us out of business, that's compromising our children's and grandchildren's futures in farming, and that's directly and deliberately undermining the sustainability of those small regional and remote local communities, small businesses and contractors—the truckies, stock agents, shearers, schools, vets, retailers, coffee shops, garages, mechanics, fuel suppliers, sporting clubs, and volunteer emergency services organisations in towns from York, Kojonup, Boyup Brook and Beverley right through to those more remote communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Each one of those businesses keeps their community going by buying from one another and supporting each other. The dollars circulate around a small community. We haven't got big communities to draw on. They support local community service and sporting organisations as well. Each one is interdependent and each one helps to make our community sustainable and survive. There is the farmer, the sheep or grain producer who buys locally—hardware, machinery, feed, super, food, groceries, tyres, mechanical services. If you haven't lived in our world, you don't understand how interdependent they are. Clearly Labor doesn't, and it does not care either. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's the local livestock transport operator who buys locally. It's the same with the shearing contractor. In turn, each one of these small businesses buys from and supports each other and the family businesses in those local communities. Every time we lose one of those families it means fewer kids in our little local schools, reductions in teaching staff and maybe closures. So what happens to the few kids who are left? As those families leave the community, there are fewer parents to help out at the schools. The local pub closes, the local shops close and communities shrink. It is brutal, but that's how it works. If you take a source of major income out of a small community, that is the result. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those of us who live and work in regional or remote Australia, we know it firsthand. As my colleague the member for Durack said recently, the consequences of this legislation are not merely political; they are deeply personal and devastating to the livelihoods of hardworking Australians who rely on this industry. Please don't underestimate the industry. It underpins our farming systems and creates thousands of jobs, from the paddock to small local communities and the broader WA economy. Why on earth would Labor think it's a great idea to make these small regional communities less self-sustaining, less viable and less cohesive—or simply disappear altogether? It's death by a thousand cuts. That's how it works. It's gradual and it happens. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ban won't create demand for chilled or boxed meat. It will simply push the live trade to countries with far lower—if any—animal welfare standards, because this is the product the market needs. As I said, the industry introduced world-leading animal welfare standards in both transport and processing. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a harsh climate and the reason sheep have thrived in this state is because they are resilient and WA farmers are so professional and know how to manage them, no matter what is thrown at them!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have the best sheep husbandry practices and to be told that we don't by people who have no interest and no part in the industry is a kick in the guts!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the facts were presented and the powers that be wanted to listen, they would realise that we are world leaders in sheep husbandry, production and export, and removing this vital option for selling sheep will only result in the most terrible outcomes for the stock, and regional WA. The first thing being that countries with much worse animal welfare outcomes will come in and sell sheep where we have been, is it case of we don't care if we are not involved? Instead of setting the standard for sheep production and export, and making the world step up to where we are by leading the way.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second thing will be that this is a giant nail in the coffin of regional WA. Our small towns survive on the people who are needed for all facets of farming sheep.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Not just the farmers, staff, their children, schools, shops, small businesses, medical facilities, volunteers, sporting groups, shire councils, stock agents, shearers, agronomists, grain merchants, the list goes on. The numbers will continue to decline in the communities the more that gets taken from us, when there are no people needed on farms to work with these sheep.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overseas markets, both historic and new markets, want our livestock. They know that Australian farmers are producing high-quality livestock that meets their needs—and these sheep actually put on weight on the voyage. Let me tell you, as someone who actually farms livestock, that animals don't put on weight if they're not really doing well. They just don't. For those in this place to say otherwise is just an absolutely false statement. The industry continues to deliver quality sheep and cattle, partly due to historic breeding improvements and the quality of our stock, along with the highest live export animal welfare standards in the world. That should say it all. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to any farmers that are watching: I met a lot of you when I was at Wagin Woolorama, and I was very worried about what this was doing to you personally. I said to you, 'If you need mental health support because you're not doing well because of what Labor is doing to you, can you please get the help you need?' You don't have to be alone in this space, and I know the trauma that this is bringing you, because some of you were very personally direct with me about this. Please get the help you need, in spite of what Labor is putting you through.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  The Albanese government supports strong animal welfare standards, and we know Australians do too. For years now, Australians have called out the live sheep export trade, describing it as cruel and inhumane. This is especially true for locals in my electorate of Corangamite. Since the people of Corangamite elected me as their representative in the federal government, they've been writing to my office, calling the trade 'barbaric and disgusting'. Many of them added their signatures to last year's 40,000-strong petition calling for a phase-out of live sheep exports. Through this petition and the many that came before, Australians have told government they want the trade to end, and the Albanese Labor government has listened. Our party went to the last two elections committing to phase out live sheep exports, and now, in government, we are acting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024, will prohibit the export of live sheep by sea from Australia. The trade will be completely phased out by May 2028. This date, and our approach, strikes the right balance. It is based on extensive support for the industry and community consultation. Our plan acknowledges that farmers and the supply chain need time to prepare, and we do acknowledge that farmers are at the centre of our food supply chain. We will support farmers, and that's why we're proposing a $107 million support plan for industry to transition to onshore processing. This will deliver more local jobs and a strong and sustainable future for the Australian sheep wool and sheepmeat industry. Importantly, our supports will be available to help all parts of the sheep industry supply chain, from farmers to truckies to shearers and processors. These workers play an important role in rural economies, and our government wants to help these workers to thrive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be said the industry has been in decline for many years, down from $415 million in turnover in 2002 to $77 million in 2023. This equates to less than 0.1 per cent of Australia's estimated agricultural production. At the same time, the trade in chilled and frozen lamb and sheepmeat has grown by 369 per cent, with exports to North Africa and the Middle East region more than tripling in value over the last two decades. In 2022-23, chilled and frozen sheepmeat exports earned $1.5 billion, compared to $85 million for live sheep exports in that same period. This is a huge difference, and it shows that much of this live sheep export trade has been replaced by a higher value, humane alternative that is already worth 58 times more to our economy—58 times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the debate today, it's worth noting that this decline in live sheep exports occurred under the watch of the Liberals and the Nationals. Over the past 10 years, when the Liberals and Nationals were in government, live sheep exports decreased by $144 million and over 1.5 million sheep, yet they stand here today claiming they back the farmers. It was on their watch that the industry declined, and not a cent of government support was provided to facilitate a transition that has been underway for the best part of 20 years. I do not often have the opportunity to acknowledge the words of a former Liberal member for Corangamite, but in this case her words in 2018 in support of ending live sheep exports still ring true. She said the following:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Overwhelmingly, the people of Corangamite are saying, 'Enough is enough.' After decades of noncompliance, after decades of inhumane treatment of sheep, after decades of tolerating a trade which continues to tarnish our international reputation, Australians are saying, 'Enough is enough'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, after receiving an assistant ministerial position in the former coalition government she withdrew her support for ending of the trade. I call on the Geelong based senator, the former member for Corangamite, to stand by these convictions and support this bill in the Senate, and I call on her colleagues here in this place to do the same and support the bill. It is time to act on the evidence. It's time to recognise the myriad opportunities we have onshore—opportunities that will deliver new jobs and support for our farmers and at the same time deliver a sustainable, humane future for the industry. It is time to phase out live sheep exports.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="247742" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOWARTH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  I rise to speak on the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024. Farming, agriculture and trade play pivotal roles in Australia's economy and national identity. Agriculture is a significant contributor to our country's GDP, providing employment in rural communities and supporting livelihoods across the nation, and many small and family businesses are involved in agriculture, including a number of members in this House, particularly on our side of the House. The Middle East is Australia's largest export partner for sheepmeat, and this demand for Australia's live sheep exports is mostly driven by Middle Eastern customers who prefer freshly slaughtered meat that adheres to specific cultural practices. Also, given their infrastructure and electricity supply over there, boxed meat isn't always applicable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, the Liberal and National parties, argue that the live sheep export ban—that's exports of sheep by sea—will have enormous consequences for local jobs, local communities, local farming families, small and family businesses and the Australian economy. This industry provides jobs, hundreds of jobs, for people who reside in Western Australia. We're going to see many of these people unemployed. We're going to see many of these people leave their communities. This would include farmers, vets, tradespersons and other people that are the backbone of those local communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Farming and agriculture are deeply ingrained in Australian culture. So to hear that the Labor Party, with this bill, wants to ban live sheep exports by sea is absolutely astounding, particularly when we look at some of the evidence that the member for Hinkler spoke about before—it's well documented—in relation to the recent Dunkley by-election in Melbourne, where a political party was giving preferences to the Labor Party, in return for, possibly, bringing this bill to the House now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Labor Party are not for farmers, small and family business, or those in rural areas. This bill further proves this. I couldn't help but hear the member for Canberra speak before. She said that when she came into parliament, in 2019, she received hundreds of emails from constituents during that time. I understand that. As a member of the House, with a marginal seat, you do look at emails from constituents. Sometimes you might get a couple or a few. At other times, in relation to live sheep, when you have a campaign on the back of Animals Australia, you might get hundreds. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was the same. When I was on the backbench, in the lead-up to the 2019 election, I received hundreds of emails about it as well, so I took note. As someone that loves animals—I've got all the animals: dogs, cats, birds and everything else—I want to make sure that animals are treated properly. So what did I do? I decided to go over to Western Australia and take a look. I don't know if the member for Canberra went over to Western Australia when she was elected in 2019. She could have. She was receiving hundreds of emails from constituents. It might be a good idea to go over and have a look at what they're emailing you about so you've got some idea of what you're talking about. That's the way I do things. That's the way I see things, when people contact me. So, on 17 January 2019, I, along with the member for Hinkler, flew to Western Australia where we were met by the member for Forrest and the member for O'Connor, whose communities are going to be particularly impacted by the Labor Party's closure of this industry. We found that trip to be very beneficial. I went there with a very open mind to look at the good things in the industry but also what could have needed improvement. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was there, on that trip in Western Australia, I met with Holly, an Australian accredited veterinarian. She's a vet who actually travels with the sheep on the ship when they go to the Middle East. Holly is also a compliance manager for live export companies as well as a vet. She travels on these ships to look after the sheep. She explained to me that there are lots of animal welfare quality assurances, from Australian farms all the way to the importing country. Regarding moving onboard, she said that what's involved with the daily routine is getting all the sheep moving around and making sure they have access to clean, fresh drinking water and food. I saw that when I boarded the ship. There were eight or so levels on the ship. Each of the pens that the sheep go into had water containers, and food containers were distributed. There were lots of those in every pen, and they were quite accessible. Also, the sheep couldn't be jam packed into the one pen. Only about two-thirds of the pen was full, so there was room to move around and so forth. There were massive vents that came out into each of the pens. It was basically like aircon. They suck fresh air from the ship into every deck. That's what I personally witnessed. I don't know if the minister or the member for Canberra has been there, or their team, but, when I looked at that and saw what was involved with this particular ship, it was excellent. It was very, very good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Holly was telling me that her job is to make sure that these sheep are looked after, there's fresh ventilation and there's food and water, and, if there are any sick sheep, they're quarantined. There is also a daily crew of about 30 people on board as well as independent observers ensuring that all processes are followed and welfare quality is ensured. The industry average of livestock mortalities from these voyages is about 0.3 per cent to one per cent. These ships have roughly 66,000 livestock on board. They're big ships with multiple decks, as I explained. Fewer than one per cent of animals would die on the journey, which is often a two-week journey. Before the animals even board the ship, they are quality checked. Any sick or injured animals or pregnant ewes are taken care of and removed from the rest. If animals become sick or injured on the vessel, they are removed and put into a quarantine facility, and the main risks for sickness or injury are lameness, pneumonia and gastrointestinal issues.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that visit to Western Australia to this live export ship, I watched all the trucks, the road trains, come in and unload the sheep as well. I put it all on social media and out there for my constituents to see. Rather than give some sort of bland response that I got from an adviser in my office or something, I actually emailed all the constituents in my electorate and said: 'Here is a video of me on site. This is Holly, the vet. This is what we're looking at. These are pictures from each of the decks.' You know what? Probably 60 per cent of the people who emailed me were satisfied with that. They said: 'Thanks very much, Luke. Thanks for going over there and actually having a look.' It's good to get some firsthand knowledge, eyeball it yourself and see what's going on with it. It's common sense, you'd think.</span>

                    </a>  Yes, Bindi Murray. The member for Forrest knows her. She is a lovely woman who has live sheep cropping. They have a challenging environment, and it becomes very seasonal. Bindi highlighted the importance of completing these live sheep exports ethically and doing it well. Bindi spoke about the transparency of the live sheep export process and how she has become more engaged with the process to have the best outcomes for the sheep. The sheep manure on the journey becomes quite dry and compacted and turns into a powder consistency. That also makes it easier for the sheep when they're laying down or standing on their hooves—for the sheep to stand on—until the area is hosed down at certain intervals. I saw all of that firsthand. I asked how Australian standards are regarded as the best in the world when it comes to live sheep exporting. Bindi said that it's quite extraordinary that Australia can go in country—to these properties overseas, the destinations where the sheep are going—and make changes the whole way along the supply chain to benefit the animal.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are basically saying—as the member for Forrest, the member for O'Connor and others speaking on this bill have said and as I heard firsthand from Bindi and from Holly, the vet—is that having Australia in the live sheep export business improves the animal welfare of every sheep in the world. What more can someone who loves animals ask for? What more can you ask for? Those opposite, I don't know if you've visited these places in Western Australia or had a look, but that is important. Don't just blindly get up here and do some sort of little speech supporting your agriculture minister because you made a promise to win the Dunkley by-election or whatever it may be. The reality is that our involvement in the Western Australian industry improves sheep lives all around the world. And, when we exit in the not-too-distant future, as the Leader of the Nationals said in his speech as well, what's that going to do? Who's going to be there to uphold the highest standards in the industry?</span>

If the industry falls and isn't as good, bad luck for them. To people that are emailing their senators or members in relation to Animal Australia's email list, what about all the other animals?

For $77 million, if you've got families that farm and they're all turning over a million dollars each—I don't know what the figures are exactly; it's probably a lot less than that—that's 77 individual businesses worth a million dollars that are gone. They're gone! They have no more income. What's going to happen? There are a lot of those businesses. They're going to pull their kids out of school. They're going to move out of that industry. They'll have to sell off their land for whatever it's worth. Where are the abattoirs here? What is the government actually doing?

A petition to reverse the government's policy and continue live sheep exports by sea received 10,000 signatures. Several members of the opposition are on the record as opposing live sheep exports from Australia. So these changes are in line with the current views of many, many Australians. But they also do affect communities, particularly in Western Australia, and we acknowledge that. It is important, however, to understand the careful scope and timing of this legislation and the transitional supports that we have put in place in order to support those communities who will be affected. This is how we do things as a government—implement important change in line with community expectations in a timely fashion and provide support and a way forward for those affected. We are trying here to strike the right balance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change has been a long time coming and has been comprehensively researched. An independent four-person panel that also included a previous CEO of the RSPCA engaged with over 2,000 attendees at in-person events and 330 people in virtual forums. They held over 80 meetings with organisations and farmer representative groups and received over 800 written submissions and 3,300 survey responses. This was incredibly comprehensive. The panel provided its report, containing 28 recommendations, to the government in October last year. Of those, 23 recommendations have been supported and five have been noted. The resulting bill before us prohibits the export of live sheep by sea from Australia from 1 May 2028. It allows the export of live sheep by air to continue.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2024-25 budget includes $107 million over five years from 2024-25 for transition support for the phase-out of live sheep exports by sea. Specific measures include $64.6 million for sheep producers and the supply chain to plan and implement transition actions and expand domestic sheep-processing capability. It will also support community and wellbeing activities and rural financial councillors. There's $27 million allocated to market sheep products in Australia and overseas, $2.6 million to continue to improve sheep welfare standards, $1.7 million to appoint a transition advocate to facilitate two-way communication between industry and government and, finally, $11.7 million for the implementation of the phase-out, including a stocktake of transition progress in 2026-27.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a change that is simply the right thing to do. It has community support and is designed for an orderly transition for industry. The end date provides certainty to farmers, supply chain businesses and trading partners. The change will encourage onshore value-adding such as domestic meat processing, creating more local jobs. A period of transition also allows for the humane management of existing stock.</span>

You have shown that your government upholds its commitments and has integrity and that you do what you say you will do.' Hear, hear! I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:10</span>):  I rise in opposition to the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024. This bill is a slap in the face and a major career- and business-ending piece of legislation. The response in Western Australia of those people concerned is overwhelmingly sad and angry at seeing their livelihoods destroyed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People have to realise that live sheep export to people in the Middle East has been a longstanding business which has attracted controversy and that improvements have been made to address the issues of heat stress. There are plenty of places in the world, particularly in the Middle East, to which Australian animals head by live export because those nations can't produce that amount of animal protein. As we know, the grazing capacity for Australian agriculture is much greater. These sheep have grazed in open pastures and are clean, healthy sheep. Their life on this planet is not taken for granted. Any farmer who is producing sheep for meat or for wool is very proud of their flocks and has cared for and tended to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since man has walked the earth, sheep and other animals have been a source of sustenance. A lot of people don't like that, and I fully respect the choices they make in their lives. A lot of strict vegans and vegetarians don't like the idea of eating animal meat, but there are millions and millions of people for whom this is the most effective way of keeping their nutrition up to the standards they require.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has been a world leader in improving the standard of transport of live animals out of our country. We've done a great deal by introducing ESCAS, which not only looks at all the steps up to hopping onto the ship but also follows the animals into the market where they are sold, and it has changed the standards in places in the Middle East where the abattoirs have been upgraded so that the cultural and social norms of having sheepmeat can be observed with their religion and their beliefs. We can't dictate to them what they do in their civilisation, with their cultural norms, or anything they should be doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What will happen if this ban goes through? You will find that other countries in Africa and in the Northern Hemisphere that have no concern for animal welfare will be there in a flash. We have to realise that the other consequences of this are that the whole blowback on the sheep industry in Australia will be much more than just what occurs in Western Australia. There were 654,000 sheep exported in 2023. This is the exact opposite of what opponents of it said was happening. A lot of the opponents said: 'It's a fading industry. People don't like it. You have to ban it.' The figures the year before, following on from COVID, were only 380,000, but a year after that they were up to 654,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sheep staying in Australia means the price the farmers and graziers will get for their sheep will go down dramatically. We saw this happen back in 2011 when there was a summary banning of the live cattle export to Indonesia. A lot of the cattle that go to Indonesia are going there as live exports because Indonesia have similar cultural and religious practices about the consumption of their meat, and they also didn't then and still don't have the widespread refrigeration in every house and every shopping centre that we have in Australia. We can't judge them by those standards. But I can tell you the same thing will happen. Even with the announcement, the price of sheepmeat has, in the marketplace at least, been deleteriously affected, and it will ricochet across the country into South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and even Tasmania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you have 650,000 sheep who generally go because that's the end of their life span and they won't be shorn any more—they are in their prime and they have good nourishment and good animal protein—it means all that value will have to fit into the eastern market, so the price will go down. What does this mean? For people who invested in years of genetic improvements for these sheep, all that value is going to evaporate overnight. A lot of their loans might have covenants on them, depending on the price of their sheep and value of their flock. It will do all of these things to all the people in the industry, who know this industry inside out. It will affect the haulage contractors, the feed suppliers and the towns in which the markets operate. All of the ramifications of banning exports mean the whole value case of those sheep will be diluted and will reduce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To do it because the government made a commitment to get preferences at the Dunkley by-election and were happy to put their principles aside to get a few votes in a by-election in another state just shows you why people are so annoyed. We're not making this up; the Animal Justice Party proudly announced it on 11 May 2024:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are proud that the AJP could deliver the knockout blow by demanding the end of live sheep export as a requirement for our preferences at the Dunkley By-election in March. Ongoing conversations behind-the-scenes between AJP and Labor leadership has helped to finetune government policy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For 20 pieces of silver the government, by this decision, is sending many businesses possibly to the wall, because their whole business case evaporates at the stroke of a pen when this goes into action. Admittedly, it's delayed till 2028, but it won't stop magically on that day; it'll be winding back from now, because people want to have certainty of supply. They want to know they have a viable industry going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our trading partners think of this very poorly. The member for Maranoa, the Leader of the National Party, actually travelled over to Kuwait and other parts of the Middle East and spoke to their industry people, and they were quite blunt and open. They're not going to buy our boxed lamb, because they don't want boxed lamb. There's a certain part of their market that wants to have freshly slaughtered animals, and that's why they built special abattoirs where the cultural practice of choosing your animal can be observed. They follow religious rules, which are up to the highest standards, for the slaughter. The standards on the vessels are a far cry from those that we saw in public several years ago on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awa</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">si Express</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package the government is offering as a readjustment package will not replace an existing driving value chain around live exports. People in the cattle industry have connected the dots: the same Animal Justice Party who congratulated themselves on trading livelihoods for a few votes at a by-election have live cattle in their sights. We will revisit this, I am sure. People are speaking about this already in those circles, because it is their firm commitment and they can hold it. But you can't destroy what is a social or cultural norm in our trading partners' countries and destroy the industry that supports them as well as their food security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I travelled to the Middle East many years ago when this was an ongoing industry. Members were speaking about it then. We travelled to the United Arab Emirates where they displayed how they developed a country that was underdeveloped at the end of World War II through developing their natural assets and have turned the place into amazing cities. Other countries in the same area, as their populations grow, have to feed people but they don't have hundreds of thousands or millions of acres of grazing country to run animals. They can only have a limited number of cattle and sheep and goats. All those animal protein industries are at risk as a result of this. The message, loud and clear, that this government needs to hear is that people in the Middle East also supply oil that runs our liquid fuel transport industry. We depend on Middle Eastern providers of our oil and we provide them with lots of other technology but particularly food security—grains and fruit as well as animal protein.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other side of the House needs to realise this will be to their detriment. The industry will not support them at the next election if that is what moves their dial. They need to know that Animal Justice have established petitions. I have heard of numbers of 10,000 or 12,000 people signing petitions to end this trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since this was announced, in Perth, in the space of three or four weeks, 60,400 people have already signed up to support the Keep the Sheep campaign, which is aimed at getting the government to change its mind. So we have only 10,000 or 12,000 across a whole country people signing a petition yet in three or four weeks, in one city in one state, we had 60,000 people put pen to paper and sign up to the Keep the Sheep. The whole idea, whether they like it or not, is not going well in WA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, I'm sure you are really enjoying being in government, because people voted you there, but a lot of those voters didn't realise that you were going to ruin agriculture, and this bill is the latest measure that will make agriculture more difficult.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Murray-Darling Basin area, which has a lot of sheep graziers and large, large flocks in Victoria and New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, they are all watching this closely. The ramifications of this ban won't just be felt in Western Australia. This is a really bad piece of policy. We do defend the rights of people to export their sheepmeat and their cattle. We insist on very high standards. We've improved the standard internationally, but this will mean that other people who get judged by Australian standards won't have to compete with us anymore; they will be given open slather. I don't support this bill— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  I rise to speak on the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024. Why is it that the Labor government continues to bite the hand that feeds it? This legislation is part of the government's promise to shut down the live sheep export industry in Australia. And why do you think the Labor government is wanting to shut down the live sheep export industry? For Green left-wing citycentric preferences, that is why. This Labor government sold the sheep industry for a dirty preference deal with the Animal Justice Party in the lead-up to the Dunkley by-election in March 2024. When Minister Watt made his announcement on the shutdown deadline on 11 May 2024, the Animal Justice Party said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what did the Animal Justice Party say is their next target? All live animal export industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I completely back former prime minister John Howard's call for the Labor Party to put the extreme Greens last at the next election. There is no place in Australian politics for extreme Greens and their continual attacks on the hardworking men and women in the mining and agricultural industries. Mr Albanese has been silent on preference deals with the Greens, and it's time for Labor to show some leadership and commit to putting the extreme Greens last. If not, it will show their contempt for our agricultural industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the sheep and wool industries in my electorate of Flynn are quite small compared to the likes of Western Australia, I speak against this legislation as I have grave fears for what industry will be next. I'm of the firm belief that we should keep the sheep and ditch this terrible legislation. Labor cannot be trusted to look after the agricultural sector with their history of attacking the beef industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Meat &amp; Livestock Australia's 2021-22 figures, Australia's red meat and livestock industry turnover was $75.4 billion. This is 7.7 per cent higher than the revised 2020-21 figures and an increase of 10.7 per cent over 2017-18 figures. In 2021-22, the Australian red meat and livestock industry employed approximately 433,389 people. In 2022, Australia produced approximately 1. 9 million tonnes of carcass weight beef and veal. In 2022, 2.7 million grain-fed cattle were marketed, equal to 47 per cent of all adult cattle slaughtered. In 2022, Australia exported 67 per cent of its total beef and veal production. The value of total beef and veal exports in 2022 was $10.4 billion, with almost 11 million head of cattle being in my home state of Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Central Queensland is the centre of Australia's beef operations, and Labor's move to cuddle up to their Greens mates while making a commitment to ban live sheep exports could be a clear call to all our beef producers: don't judge Labor by their words, judge them by their actions. Their intended actions are now loud and clear. Labor shut down the live trade before, and now they want to do it again. They've started with sheep and then they'll move on to beef, just like they did in 2011 when, at a moment's notice, they shut down the live beef trade—costing Australian graziers many millions of dollars and harming our international relations. This kneejerk reaction from the Labor government back in 2011 meant some graziers went bankrupt and had to sell up. Some, tragically, took their own lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2020, a group of cattle producers, exporters and service providers won a class action in the Federal Court, which found that the former Labor government's 2011 decision to ban live exports to Indonesia was unlawful. The beef industry won that battle all the way to the High Court, and Labor have now indicated that they just want to kick the industry in the teeth rather than stand up and protect those who create wealth for our nation. In the years since, according to the ABC, only the lead claimant, the Brett Cattle Company, has received compensation. In January, the Labor government rejected the 215 remaining claimants and offered to settle the case for $510 million plus costs and interest, which could have resulted in a total figure of more than $800 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does this Labor government hate our agricultural industries so much? The previous coalition government invested billions in upgrading core infrastructure for the beef industry, including roads, rail and sales complexes. Labor is now plotting how they can sacrifice the sector in return for the support of inner-city ultra Greens. They are not on our side and they need to be held to account for their betrayal of the livestock sector. The biggest concern from producers in the electorate of Flynn is, 'Will the beef industry be next?' The Labor government's policy to end live sheep exports is shameful, blatantly ideological and reckless. Labor's policy to shut down the live sheep export industry fails to acknowledge the importance of this sector to supply a chain of people: our trading partners, their food security and the Australian economy. Live sheep employs thousands of Western Australians—more than 3,000 people—and has delivered important and comprehensive animal welfare reforms in recent years. It is crucial to recognise that the live sheep export industry employs shearers, truck drivers, fodder suppliers, livestock agents, farmers, producers and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has the highest animal welfare standards in the world, and this should be a source of national pride. Labor should be backing and supporting our farmers instead of attacking and destroying these live export industries. Since Labor embarked on shutting down the live sheep trade, confidence in the market has fallen. Prices for sheep plummeted in 2023 and thousands of Western Australians who rely on this industry are desperately worried about their futures. The timing of Labor's legislation to ban the industry is appalling, when Western Australian farmers are battling the effects of a very, very dry autumn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's decision carries enormous consequences for the agricultural sector, and if we allow this policy to be implemented it will set a precedent for any lawful agricultural industry. If this decision proceeds, our farmers will ask, 'What industry will be next?' This policy sends a frightening and alarming message to all animal production industries. The Labor government's policy to end live sheep exports is not based on science, evidence or data. Good agriculture policy must be driven by science, facts and solid evidence, not by extreme activist agendas which hurt innocent people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ending this industry will damage Australia's trading relationships in the Middle East, where our sheep are currently exported to, as this product is very important for their food security. Shutting down live sheep exports will damage our trading relationships and hurt food security in the Middle East. Our trading partners do not want chilled or boxed meat. They will secure their sheep from elsewhere, potentially from nations with poorer animal welfare standards than Australia. If Australia doesn't export live sheep, our existing trading partners will source alternatives from countries that do not have Australia's exceptionally high animal welfare standards, resulting in perverse international animal welfare outcomes. This was highlighted, tragically, in June 2022 when 15,000 sheep drowned due to a foreign boat having over 6,000 sheep beyond its limit. These are the animal welfare standards that will fill the void if Australia exits this industry field. And the government's $107 million so-called 'transition' package for the live sheep export industry is an insult and a disgrace. The package will do very little to assist the whole supply chain to plan and implement transition actions and to expand domestic sheep-processing capacity.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation to end live sheep exports is another horrific blow to the agricultural sector and to regional Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In just two years under this Labor government, the people, families, communities and industries in regional Australia are doing it tough, and it's a direct consequence of policy decisions this government is making. What we have seen in the 24 months since the Albanese government was elected is an unprecedented, targeted assault on regions. This includes billions in cuts to infrastructure and road, rail and water projects. More than $7 billion was taken out of water infrastructure in Labor's first budget in 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To make matters worse, the Labor government has betrayed the Bundaberg and North Burnett regions in their most recent budget by slashing funding to restore Paradise Dam. Prime Minister Albanese sat in the ABC Wide Bay studios and promised Labor would repair the dam. Now they have cut the funding that the previous coalition government secured. They've torn up dedicated agricultural visas despite crippling and widespread workforce shortages and attempted to impose the shambolic $150 million biosecurity protection levy—a new tax which will force Australian farmers to pay for biosecurity risks to their international competitors in bringing their products into this country. They've committed to the reckless rollout of wind and solar factories and 28,000 kilometres of transmission lines across agricultural land in the pursuit of a disastrous all-renewables approach to our energy grid. There are around 60 projects proposed in the electorate of Flynn alone, forcing havoc in local communities and the environment. There's a tax on new vehicles, where Australian families, farmers and tradies will pay more for SUVs, four-wheel drives and utes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost-of-living crisis continues to worsen. Labor's homegrown inflation remains high. On their watch, Australians are paying 11 per cent more for food, 14 per cent more for housing, 13 per cent more for rent, 20 per cent more for electricity, 25 per cent more for gas, 11 per cent more for health, 11 per cent more for education and 15 per cent more for insurance. The Labor government have also turned their backs on regional communications, falsely claiming that the Mobile Black Spot Program has not been cut to zero. The communications minister has been attempting to argue that the program has not been defunded. But the facts are that the budget papers show that zero funding has been allocated to mobile black spot programs in 2027-28, and Labor specifically refer to the conclusion of the program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Asked about these issues recently, Minister Rowland told the host of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sounds of the Mountains</span> program that the budget papers need to be read as a whole, not in isolation, and clearly show that the program has been funded through the better connectivity plan, so the assertion being made is absolutely wrong. Unfortunately, Minister Rowland, the budget papers reveal that this is not the case. In 2027-28, funding is cut to zero not only for the Mobile Black Spot Program but also for the Better Connectivity Plan for Regional and Rural Australia. The minister said the Mobile Black Spot Program will be funded by the better connectivity program, but that is not the case, because there is no money at all in the budget for the better connectivity program in 2027-28. It is not possible to fund a program with zero dollars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time the government was honest about the axing of the funding of the Mobile Black Spot Program. The Albanese government is not being upfront with the people, especially those in rural and regional Australia who rely on this program. We can see again that the Labor government is not serious about improving connectivity in rural Australia. It was the coalition government that set up the Mobile Black Spot Program, and once again we see Labor crab walking away from supporting it. Minister Rowland must reverse the decision to defund the Mobile Black Spot Program and must ensure that the people of the Flynn electorate and other regional communities have the same connectivity rights as the rest of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be opposing this legislation, as it is another example of the government once again biting the hand that feeds it. Today, I call on the Prime Minister, Mr Albanese, and the minister for agriculture, Murray Watt, to come to Central Queensland, look our graziers in the eye and make the commitment that they will not ban live cattle exports. Keep the sheep, and protect our critical agricultural industries.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  In 14 years in this place, I have never heard as much misinformation, disinformation and downright drivel as I've heard during the opposition's contribution regarding the phasing out of the live sheep export industry such as the claim I heard from the member for Maranoa about the conditions on live export vessels. Heavens! It sounded like he was describing a Carnival cruise with the conditions described as being so luxurious for the sheep. This is patent nonsense. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality about the conditions on the vessels is to be found on the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry's own website where, among other pieces of very valuable information, there are reports from independent observers that travelled on 53 journeys between 2018 and 2023. Of the reports the independent observers filed, 64 per cent documented indicators of heat stress, ranging from increased respiratory rates to sheep with extended necks and extreme heat stress; and 30 per cent reported marked heat stress, measured as open-mouthed panting or worse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Activities inconsistent with the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock were noted in approximately 70 per cent of the reports from the independent observers, cited by the agriculture department. The inconsistencies with ASEL included poor loading practices; poor handling of sheep; poor management of ill sheep; lambing on board; wool length greater than 25 millimetres—leading to a higher risk of heat stress; loading of sheep with horns; obstructed access to food and water; and sheep with pre-existing health issues and injuries. In other words, any claims that the conditions on the vessels are like a cruise liner are patent nonsense. Then, of course, there are the numerous exposes over the years. Who could forget the most shocking expose, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awa</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">si </span><span style="font-style:italic;">E</span><span style="font-style:italic;">xpress</span>, with lambs born on board, drowning in the faeces, urine and filth on the decks of that vessel. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding the claim that no country has better animal welfare standards than Australia, every country that doesn't participate in the live animal export trade has better animal welfare standards than us. For example, New Zealand banned live animal exports years ago. There's currently a bill before the UK House of Commons that would ban live export from the UK. Germany is tightening safeguards. It is patent nonsense to maintain this fiction that Australia is leading the world in animal welfare standards. We are not. You only have to look at these figures from the agriculture department and compare us with countries that have banned the trade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the ridiculous claim that the live sheep export trade is somehow growing when in fact it's shrunk by 90 per cent over the last two decades. The only reason there's been a small bump in recent numbers is exactly that: just a small bump in the numbers. But, when you look at the trendline since 2003, it has been down, down, down and down. In fact, WA live sheep exports are now valued at less than $100 million. That is less than two per cent—not much more than one per cent—of the value of Australian sheepmeat exports. What is growing is exports of processed sheepmeat now valued at almost $4.5 billion. That's right: the live trade is worth less than $100 million; and the processed sheepmeat trade is worth something in the order of $4,500 million. We are now supplying more than 50 per cent of the global sheepmeat trade. Is this going to the Middle East or is this another fiction that customers in the Middle East will only buy live animals? Well, processed meat to the Middle East is going up in the United Arab Emirates and it's going up in shipments to Kuwait. Our sales to Qatar are going up. Our sales to Jordan are going up. Our sales to Saudi Arabia are going up. In other words, customers in the Middle East and North Africa are craving our high-quality processed sheepmeat, be it frozen or chilled. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What of this very significant claim—and I should add that I have all the respect in the world for our farmers—that the ban will destroy their farms and destroy the towns in those farming regions? I would say to those farmers: stop listening to the nonsense from the opposition and face the reality that your industry is in terminal decline. In fact, it's the politicians who want to help you pivot to a different mix on the farm and different practices on the farm and to provide $107 million of assistance so that farmers and towns—</span>

                    </a>  The fact is that the industry is in terminal decline, and, if people in this place really care about the farmers and don't want to be just using the farmers to score cheap political points in this place, then they would get behind helping the industry to pivot, for the farmers to change the mix on their farm and to change the practices on their farm so that, rather than crashing into the end of the industry with no preparation, under the government's plan they have four years to slowly transition across and be ready for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't make this point lightly, but it seems to me that the opposition—and, in particular, the National Party members—are desperate for some issue to latch onto to look like they're fighting for farmers. But the reality is that, by fighting for the farmers on this issue, what they're doing is letting the farmers down by preventing or slowing down their transition to an alternative mix of farming on the property.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most bizarre claims by the opposition is that only a minority of people want reform. This is a crazy proposition. In fact, polling conducted by McCrindle research in May 2023 found that 71 per cent of Western Australians supported the phase-out, including 69 per cent of Western Australians in rural and regional areas of the state. So it's not a case of how many signatures are on a petition; it's about proper research done by proper research companies which are finding that almost three-quarters of Western Australians—almost 70 per cent of Western Australians in rural and regional areas—want this trade done away with. National polling also conducted by McCrindle research in 2022 placed support for the phase-out across the whole country at 78 per cent. In other words, this is a trade that is not only systemically cruel and not in Australia's economic best interest but has very low levels of support. I'm delighted and I'll give credit where it is due. Here's an issue where the federal government are actually in step with the wishes of the vast majority of Australians, and I applaud them for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say to the opposition that there are two claims that have been made in various members' contributions that do have merit at face value. I want to dwell on those for a moment. There is the point that some people in the Middle East want live sheep for cultural or religious reasons. I agree. That is an entirely valid point to make. But to suggest that not selling sheep to those people is going to break the back of our sheepmeat export industry is patent nonsense. Less than two per cent of Australia's sheepmeat exports are live sheep. I make the point that, if these people are going to be provided with live animals, why on earth would they come from just about the furthest place on the planet and have to endure just about the longest sea voyage that any animals could have to endure? What about those people sourcing their stock from Spain, Romania or other nearby countries that, as best I can tell, don't have animal welfare standards worse than Australia and are much closer, ensuring that the journey that those suffering animals go on is much shorter?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point made by the opposition—and I see face-value merit in this—is that customers will just get their live sheep from somewhere else. I offended honourable members in this place recently when I likened that to the drug dealers' defence. I wasn't calling the members of the opposition drug dealers, but we all know that that is the defence used by drug dealers: 'If they don't get the drugs from us, they'll get them from somewhere else.' I don't buy that. We need to, as a country, act with integrity, do the right thing and set an example for the rest of the world about what is the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to genuinely get behind our primary producers and grow their exports to the rest of the world, then we need to do everything we can do to foster our reputation as a clean, ethical primary producer. That's so if you buy anything from Australia then it has been produced in the best country in the world, to the best standards in the world, and it has been produced with real integrity. That's what will grow our primary production—not by being seen on the world stage as a pariah which continues to send animals virtually to the other side of the planet in some of the most shocking conditions imaginable. I applaud the government for pushing through with this; I know it isn't easy. Yes, I want the ban to be in place sooner and, yes, I do want to shut down the life beef cattle export trade. I do—and I'll turn my mind to that now and keep campaigning on that. It is a difficult policy area for reform, so I will applaud the government. And I won't be moving any amendments, even though I'd like to see a shutdown sooner than four years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bottom line is that the live export trade is systemically cruel. That anyone would come into this place and dispute that beggars belief. They either haven't been paying attention or they are trying to fool people who might be listening in. It isn't in Australia's best economic interests. Surely we would do better to raise these sheep and the beef cattle here, and to process them in Australia? We already have a lot of spare capacity in our abattoirs. And, where we don't have enough capacity to process these sheep, then we should build capacity. And, if we have trouble getting workers for these abattoirs, then we should work out how to fill those jobs—there's an important role for government into the future. And the trade has little public support; as I said, the research by McCrindle Research put support for a phase-out at 78 per cent, nationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to phase it out because history shows that the fundamental problems in the industry can't be remedied. You just can't get numbers on these vessels so low as to achieve genuine animal welfare and for those voyages to be profitable. They will always be overcrowded as far as animal welfare goes. Remember the filth, remember the suffering and remember the barbaric conditions that we've seen in media revelations over recent years. It's not a luxury cruise liner, as the opposition would have us believe—no. I make the point again: the only way to end cruelty is to end the trade, full stop.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BATES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  I rise to speak on the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024. The Greens welcome the government's decision to ban live sheep exports from 1 May 2028 and to fund a package to help farmers and communities transition out of the industry. This win belongs to the brave whistleblowers and the determined animal welfare organisations who have fought tirelessly for decades for the inherently cruel and morally bankrupt live sheep export trade to be shut down. The Greens have introduced two bills since 2011 to ban live exports and have continued to fight for an end to this practice for decades. It's good to see, many years and many deaths later, that Labor finally accepts a ban on live sheep export is necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it's great to see the government commit to an end date, 2028 is still too far away. Thousands of sheep will continue to suffer and die on sweltering, packed death ships until then. The Greens intend to introduce amendments to the bill in the Senate to ensure that the industry doesn't ramp up the cruel exports in the years leading up to the ban and to protect sheep until the ban comes into force. The Greens have stood firmly against live export for decades because animals are not mere cargo; they are living, breathing, sentient beings that deserve a dignified life, free from suffering, just as much as anyone else does. The reality is that the live export trade cannot be made safe for any animal. It is a business model built on cruelty that causes untold animal suffering. It is a business model that will always put profit above animal welfare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments have facilitated this trade for decades, condemning thousands upon thousands of animals to horrific death and unimaginable suffering. Mortality is just one measure, though. So many sheep suffer in extreme heat and crammed, stressful and overcrowded, filthy containers, going hungry and thirsty. The disasters have continued even into this year. After more than 9,200 sheep and 3,700 cattle were subjected to torturous heat on the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Bahijah</span> for eight straight days back in 2018, in January of this year a further roughly 14,000 sheep were left sweltering through a heatwave off the coast of Western Australian on the very same ship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The industry has long tried to hide and diminish the true extent of suffering involved in live export, and the government has enabled this. To this day, there is little transparency about the suffering on these ships. It is only thanks to the tireless and courageous efforts of animal welfare advocates and whistleblowers who, time after time, have exposed the cruelty of this industry. There have been dozens of reforms, reviews and inquiries since the industry started, but the cruelty has always continued. It is crystal clear that we cannot stop animal cruelty in live export, because animal cruelty is inherent to live export. We won't be alone in doing this either. In New Zealand there have been no shipments of live animals for slaughter purposes since 2008, and the sky did not fall in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that the community is firmly in favour of banning live sheep exports, with poll after poll showing huge support from the Australian public. In fact, in June 2023, the Greens commissioned a poll that showed 85 per cent of Australians support a phase-out of live sheep export. This is one of the reasons the live sheep export trade has already declined by over 70 per cent since 2018, accelerating a longer term decline that has been happening over two decades. This needs to end, and it needs to end as soon as possible.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024, and I certainly will not be supporting this bill. We've heard the last two speakers, and their whole speeches were dripping in sanctimony and ideology, but I'm here to offer the real story and the realism. I've been very fortunate to be on two committees in parliament. I'm on the joint agriculture committee and I'm also on the coalition ag committee, so I've had the opportunity to go across to Western Australia, to talk to sheep farmers and to have a good look around. So I don't get my information off the back of a cornflakes packet like some of the people do. I'm a farmer by trade, and I get to be able to see and feel the real story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During my last visit to WA, I toured the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Dareen</span>, which is a live sheep ship, and I toured that with export manager Paul Keenan from Livestock Shipping Services. It was really interesting to go through that ship and do it from start to finish. He took my tour at late notice, because no-one actually knew that I was going to go there, so nothing was set up. It was exactly as it is. I went aboard the ship, and the bottom couple of layers actually have cattle on the bottom. We've heard from the honourable member for Clark, who said that he's happy to get the live cattle industry killed off as well and not just the sheep industry. I just wonder: is that the cunning plan for those opposite? Is it sheep first, and then is the live cattle industry going to be killed off as well?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know, in my electorate of Dawson, how they've killed off the gillnets. About 90 fishermen, not to mention the auxiliary businesses, have lost all their business. You can just see the modus operandi here—how it seems to be one primary industry after another facing the axe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's go back to the ship. When you go on the ship, there are cattle on the bottom couple of rows, and then you go into the live sheep decks. They have the live sheep pens on the side, nice open walkways as you go through, sheep in the middle, walkways again and then sheep on the side. And all the sheep are divided up. In each pen there's 30 per cent space, so there's plenty of room for all the sheep to move around within those pens. There's also a hospital pen on there. In case any of the sheep get crook or they're not feeling so well, they're taken from their pen and put in the hospital pen to be nursed back to health. There's ventilation on the top. You can't feel it quite as much because it's open air, so you haven't got a vacuum, but when you go down within the ship you can actually feel the air ventilation going through. This is the lived experience. This is actually what happens and is the real story. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Food and water are delivered to the sheep. Every single pen has feeders across it and water going through it. All the sheep are constantly monitored. People are walking through them. They have vets. Even the captain, who I met on the ship, takes a personal interest in that because he knows, as does the crew, that to have successful outcomes and successful voyages you have to have happy and healthy sheep. If they don't, then they don't have a job. Pure self-interest makes them do the best possible job they can. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is Paul's business model. He bought these sheep. He's got a feedlot, so he fattened the sheep up a little bit more. He made sure they were nice and strong and ready for the voyage. Then he loaded them onto the ship. When they come off the ship they go into another feedlot and then get sold for processing. Let's just have a look at that. If you've got a business, and your business model is to have happy and healthy sheep, wouldn't you do every single thing possible to make sure that those sheep are healthy and looked after? I certainly would, because that's how you make money in the real world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People were talking about temperature. Now they only send the sheep in the cooler times of the year. They have learnt what the best possible time is to send sheep, and that's what they do. That is real animal welfare. But don't just take my word for it. Dr Holly Ludeman, a renowned vet, provided this evidence when I was on the joint ag committee. The success rate of the sheep is now 99.85 per cent. So they're actually safer and better off when they're on the ship than when they're in the paddock. They actually have problems when they're in the paddock as well. I suppose it's like cars. When they're driving down the road, every now and again they have an accident. Some things do go wrong. But, with the live sheep trade, when they're on the ship, they're looked after exceptionally well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were over there, I talked to the farmers. A lot of these farmers have been on the land for three, four, five generations—one for up to six generations. They are really concerned about their livelihoods and their welfare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard some of the members of the Greens and the crossbench talking about transition. Some of the farmers said to me: 'Andrew, we can't transition. Our land is not suitable for this. Our land is suitable for sheep. We can't grow crops. The soil type is not in the right condition that it needs to be in.' These farmers are actually hurting. I know we're talking a lot about sheep and their welfare, but let's digress a little bit and talk about farmers' welfare. Are we concerned about how farmers are and how their mental health is? Are we concerned about how they've got to go home and explain to their kids, 'We're going to have to walk off the land here because it doesn't work'? Let's think about their mental health. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 1,300 people in a rally in Perth, and thousands of people attended the hearing in Muresk, telling their stories. They're not just stories that have been made up on the back of a cornflakes packet. These are real people and real people's livelihoods. I'd like to read an open letter from a sheep farmer: 'We have been sheep farming for 46 years and haven't sent a sheep on a boat for over 25 years, but I would like to know that that is still an option. They used to say that Australia rode on the sheep's back. This is true, but there are many things that keep us prosperous. Wool and sheep are seen as valuable commodities, so much so that in the 1980s and nineties a government-backed reserve price scheme was introduced. This created an oversupply, and as a result over four million bales of wool were stockpiled, because alternatives like cotton and synthetics were more affordable—a lesson learned that market dictates the price. The solution to this was another government backed scheme called the flock reduction scheme, which involved sheep farmers rounding up their youngest breeding ewes, digging a hole and euthanising them to receive $6 per head in compensation. I never participated, but many did—another bad policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's debate is different. From the dark days of the tragic <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi</span>, our sheep industry has imposed its own restrictions to achieve a goal in animal welfare standards that the world is proud of, without government intervention. Why step in and ban an industry that is progressive and expanding ethically? Mr Watt is quoted as saying that 70 per cent of Australians are against live export. I do recall a referendum around that number, but that was certainly not with regard to live export. I ask that you people in government think seriously about opposing this legislation based on the facts I've given.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's signed Vanessa O'Brien from Pingelly, WA—an accurate testament. The lady handed me that letter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard from the crossbench again that the trade is decreasing. It has over a long period of time, but in the last couple of years it has been increasing. That's what happens when you have market forces. Some things go down and then up, but now we're in an upward trend. If it is so bad and we're going to lose it anyway, why not let the market forces take their course? Let them sort it out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard some heartfelt pleas from local government, mayors and counsellors, and they said: 'This is going to decimate our shires and decimate our region. All the businesses are going to be affected, the farmers. It's going to affect schools. The schools will be closing, and it's going to cost hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.' I think the transition is $107 million or something. They said that is a pittance. It will not even touch the sides. Plus there's no modelling on how that $107 million is going to work, but that's a little bit of a side note.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">International reputation is another one. What does this say to our people over in the Middle East that we are currently serving with the live export. Are we saying, 'You're not good enough to eat our sheep now'? They will then have to go and buy that sheep from someone else, someone who doesn't have the same standards as us. In the whole animal welfare debate, is a sheep not a sheep not a sheep across the whole world? If you're looking for animal welfare, why not support the Australian industry, which actually has the best standards in the world? Would it be just because of cheap political point scoring? Would it be for those opposite? I can see in question time I think the Labor-Greens coalition is in a little bit of trouble. There's a bit of argy-bargy backwards and forwards. Is that what it is? I'm not exactly sure, but I think we need to make the decision on facts and we need to make sure that we are supporting our farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are different types of sheep as well. You have lambs, and as they grow a bit older they grow into hoggets, two-teeth sheep, and then you have mutton. People say, 'We'll just process these sheep locally.' The fact of it is, as farmers have told me, the sheep that they're actually sending to live export aren't suitable to be processed locally. They have no commercial value. Again, this is a trade that underpins and provides some certainty not for just the meat industry but for the wool industry, because they are sheep that they can shear five or six times and then put on a boat and actually make some money out of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is a coalition government will reinstate the live sheep export industry. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with our farmers, support our farmers and make sure we're there for them. There are so many businesses involved: the truck drivers and the shearers. Let's talk about the shearers—isn't that where the Labor Party started, in Barcaldine, with the famous knowledge tree? Now, all of a sudden, the Labor government is turning its back on those very shearers and the workers. When I was a kid we were told that the Labor Party looks after the workers. But no—not anymore. They just want to look after their votes in the cities and their little deals that they've done with their Greens counterparts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest: the inquiry we did was quick. It was quick and dirty, to be honest. Two or three weeks, then bang! We had to go over and get the information, and there were a whole lot of submissions that weren't even fully analysed. So what I'm calling for is to make sure that we have a Senate inquiry. This one needs to be shelved and we should have a Senate inquiry, where these people's livelihoods and where the live sheep trade industry can actually have their say and have their information fully analysed and treated with respect and dignity so that we can keep that vital industry going. And, for heaven's sake, let's make sure that we keep the live cattle trade open and thriving as well, and not listen to some of our members from the crossbench.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  I rise to speak on the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024. Most of us will remember the sickness we felt in our stomachs when we saw the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">7</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span style="font-style:italic;">30</span> footage on board the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> back in 2018. We remember the sense of anger and injustice as we witnessed the appalling conditions those 60,000 sheep were exposed to—conditions that ultimately resulted in the inhumane death of 2,400 of these helpless animals from causes like heat exhaustion and dehydration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is because of this, and incidents like this, that the live sheep trade has lost its social licence in Australia. Over the past two years, I have received an ongoing stream of letters and calls from dozens of my constituents, horrified by these reports and images. Few issues have attracted such prolonged and emotive attention by my community, because animal welfare is an issue that cuts through Australians regardless of location or industry. All of us live among animals and we are collectively appalled by instances of cruelty and traumatised by the helplessness. I promised my community to fight for the end of live sheep exports and the government too promised the people of Australia to put an end to this trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that under this bill the export of live sheep will be phased out by 1 May 2028. I am also pleased by the recognition of support needed for those adversely affected by the transition of this industry. That's because, while I support this bill, I do acknowledge that people's livelihoods are affected by this bill and that many farmers, particularly in WA, will need to adjust their businesses or leave the industry entirely—and this is hard. I have been moved by the scenes last week of Western Australians lining the streets and tuning into the House standing committee. I have even been contacted by concerned Western Australians, outlining the impact they feel it will have on farmers, businesses and communities in Australia. I have heard your concerns. And while the industry has introduced new animal welfare measures since the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>, such as mandatory vets on board for long voyages, I am just not convinced that any measure can guarantee the end of suffering during live exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Alliance for Animals, for instance, found that 60 per cent of voyages since 2018 have experienced heat stress while travelling across the equator and the Persian Gulf. Sheep are still exposed to cramped and unhygienic conditions, 24-hour lighting, constant loud noises and inadequate food and medical care on compliant vessels, resulting in distress and death. Furthermore, I do not believe that our duty of care for these animals stops at the point of destination. Despite our best advocacy efforts, Australian sheep continue to be handled poorly in overseas markets. The only way we can guarantee humane treatment of animals through to the end of life is to process these sheep here, where we can monitor and hold the industry to account effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard it said that Australia's treatment of live exports sets a global standard and that withdrawing from the industry will result in a void being filled by even worse conditions. This may be so, but doing something wrong better does not make it right. There will be an economic cost as the remaining exports are gradually phased out and that is why I am glad to see an economic support package included in this bill. This transition support includes $107 million, with $64.6 million of direct funding allocated to assist sheep producers and exporters transition to new opportunities, including the expansion of meat processing facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For some years now, the industry has been in natural decline, with live sheep export occupying a smaller and smaller fraction of the exported sheepmeat and the Western Australia economy. From 2002 to 2023, in financial years, the number of live sheep exported decreased by 90 per cent. Last financial year, live sheep exports by sea made up 0.02 per cent of WA's gross state product and only 5.4 per cent of WA's total value of sheep exports, because the industry is already moving away from live sheep exports. However, I know that this ban will make it hard for some, and it is for these communities that the support package is essential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents progress but 2028 is a long way away and our job is not yet done. The promise to end the export of live sheep was made two years ago, ahead of the 2022 election, but it will be another four years before this ban is fully implemented. While we work towards the deadline in 2028, we need to do everything possible to minimise animal suffering in the meantime, as well as work with the farmers affected to support them in their transition. We are headed in the right direction but we're not moving fast enough. I'm pleased the government is consulting on its Australian animal welfare strategy with the stated commitment to a national approach to animal welfare. That is essential in this country. I know the people of my electorate expect better for animals across Australia, including those live sheep exported, and they want this parliament to take action. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  This bill is a treacherous act not just against the good farmers of Western Australia and those involved in the live sheep export industry but further, to the Australian people who go out there every single day and work to put money in the coffers that this government spends irresponsibly. What government in any country would shut down a billion-dollar industry? We have an $80 billion agricultural industry and this government, this Labor-Greens-teal government, wants to shut down a part of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But put the billions of dollars aside—put that aside—what about the cost to those generational farmers, those people who have worked the land for decades and decades, who have put it all on the line year after year, who have paid their taxes, who have done their dues, who will have it all pulled out from underneath them? The government says, 'Well, that's too bad. You will be right; you can retrain. We will give $107 million to share between 3,000 individual farmers and tens of thousands of subcontractors indirectly linked to the industry.' How much money do you think those farmers and subcontractors will see? Not much—nothing. If it's any reflection of the policies that Labor puts out, half of it will go on consultancy fees. That is where it will go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a decision based on two things: ideology and a deal done between Labor and the Greens on a by-election. That's exactly what this is. So, to get the numbers and to get the power—speaking of power, the power is going out!—the Western Australian farmers are being sacrificed. They are lambs to the slaughter, because this government—this Labor, teals and Greens government—doesn't care about the Western Australian farmers. It doesn't care about farmers in general, and we saw that through the biosecurity tax only recently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's look at the logic. Yes, in the past, there have been poor practices. We accept that. We have acknowledged that, but what did we do about that? In 2019, we implemented the world's best practice for exporting live sheep. Nobody across the floor has disputed that fact. That is a fact. We measure the fleece on those sheep down to the millimetre before they get on the boat. We weigh the sheep before they get on the boat. There is technology to examine the air that flows through the boat during the trip. We have veterinarians on the boats; we have inspectors on the boats. The results show for themselves. The sheep that get on the boats are putting on weight on the trip. A distressed animal doesn't gain weight. We've had plenty from this side who have had experience in farming with sheep and cattle, who tell us you that you will not get a beast to put on weight in distress. We have an industry with world's best practice which this government, hand in hand with the teals and the Greens, has decimated for ideology and for a dirty deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to the Western Australian farmers, you are justified in being outraged, because you have been crushed by the government which is supposed to be protecting you. They have said, 'We don't care about you,' and they have crushed what you have worked for—what your fathers and mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers have worked for for decades and decades, and they don't care. Coming up to the next election, I know that you will remember that—that they said to you: 'We don't care. We're going to crush your industry. We don't care if you lose your home. We don't care if you have overheads. We're going to be the nation that bans live exports even though they have the world's best practices.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's step aside and ask what else we could do—say, 'Let's build an abattoir here, and let's kill the sheep here and pack the meat to go overseas.' There are two things there. Firstly, that is not what the countries that we export to want. Why should we be telling them how they should be receiving their export goods? That's the first issue. Why should we be so sanctimonious and carry on like elitists and tell other countries how we will deal with them in trade? Secondly, sheep export is seasonal. If you were to build an abattoir, you would have to run it 24/7, 365 days a year to make it viable. It is just not possible to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the biggest issues about live sheep exports is the cultural aspect for other countries. It is a cultural and deeply religious issue for them. We see in Dubai and other places that their abattoirs have viewing rooms for up to 2,000 people to watch the process of that beast or sheep being slaughtered. It is done so culturally, and it is done so humanely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For us to tell our trade nations how they should be doing things or what they should be thinking is, in fact, an insult to them. It is damaging our reputation with our international trade partners. But is this a consideration that was taken into account in crushing the live sheep trade? No. We just went ahead arrogantly. We know best. Australia knows best. In turn, what's going to happen now? We're exporting 500,000 sheep a year. Where are they going to go? Where are they going to come from to go to these alternative trade nations? They're going to go from Somalia and African countries that have zero animal welfare—none in place. They work on volume and value. They couldn't care less how many animals die.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For sanctimony, ideology and symbolism, you are going to see a substantial increase in the deaths of sheep being exported from other nations. Yet there's nothing from the other side. 'Australian sheep are safe now.' Don't worry about sheep from Africa. Don't worry about the fact that we have the best practices in the world, and they've got the worst practices. They don't have any animal welfare practices; they just load them on. 'Get them on; make sure the boat doesn't sink. We'll toss the carcasses over the side for the sharks once they die. And we'll make money on how many survive at the other end.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just complete contempt from this Prime Minister and, quite frankly, complete contempt from the agriculture minister, who made jokes in a speech at a budget night function just recently, when the farmers walked out. He said, 'I'm lucky I didn't say that earlier.' He couldn't even go and face the farmers in Western Australia. He increased the carbon footprint by flying over to Western Australia to go to the Commonwealth buildings to make an announcement. He could not eyeball the farmers. I know why he couldn't. It's because he knows he's wrong. He knows he sold out the Western Australian farmers, the Western Australian people, the truckers and the shearers—all those people involved in the industry. He couldn't stand there and eyeball them. If you believe you're right, Minister, why didn't you do that? And, Prime Minister, why didn't you go over there, speak to them and say, 'I'm sorry I'm ripping away your generational legacy. I'm sorry I'm ripping away your job'? Prime Minister, you'd want to hope that the ideology that we shouldn't have prime ministers in this country doesn't come out of there. I'm sure that won't happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contempt speaks volumes, and not just from the Prime Minister or the minister but from those opposite, particularly those on the crossbench. We hear about how terrible this industry is. Well, I haven't seen any sheep roaming down Victoria Road in Sydney or through Wentworth in Sydney. You might go to a petting zoo every now and then, but that just doesn't cut the mustard. Go and walk a mile in these people's shoes. Go and sit with them at the kitchen table now they know their industry is about to be decimated because you've done a dirty deal with the Greens and teals to get your numbers. That's not how a country runs. The government is here to support our industry. This is a billion-dollar industry. You have kicked it into the gutter and you are going to literally kill these hardworking families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of the most abhorrent bills that I have seen any government introduce. They don't care about the farmers. They say they care about the welfare of sheep, yet what we'll now see is sheep from countries with no protections. We'll see no welfare protections for the animals on board. It'll be worse than ever. But that's not taken into account because they've achieved what they needed to achieve, and that was the dirty deal with the Greens. It will be forever remembered. God hope that we get back into government, because we will repeal this, and we will work with the Western Australian sheep farmers—all farmers—because they need to be appreciated. We, on this side—the National Party and the LNP—are very grateful for their existence.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  I was in this chamber earlier today when the member for Paterson delivered the parliamentary committee majority finding. I was also here when the member for O'Connor tabled the dissenting report. I believe the member for Paterson; I found her a fine person. She's a nice lady. I think she works hard for her electorate. But I am really surprised. She has a significant agriculture sector in her electorate. I know it's the Labor Party and dissension is simply not allowed, but I would be surprised if her heart was in that finding that the committee delivered today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She was in Western Australia recently with the committee. Around 2,000 industry representatives confronted her there at a recent hearing. She must have heard the same voices I heard when I led a coalition agriculture backbench committee to Western Australia in March to meet with growers, shearers, truckies, stock agents and young women in the sheep industry to discuss the government's proposed ban on sheep exports. She and that committee must have heard the same story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say that this is seen as a Western Australian issue. It is not only a Western Australian issue. I don't currently farm, but I own a farm in South Australia, and part of that farm has sheep on it. Following the government decision last year—I think it was back in about March—to announce the phase-out of the industry with, at that stage, an unknown time reference to just how they were going to go about it, there has been a collapse of confidence in the Western Australian sheep industry in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Growers are sick of interference and not just on this issue. Whether it be managing staff, maintaining and managing their machinery, farm practices or water management, they're sick of interference. The government has their fingers in the pie at every level, and this is another insult on top of all those things before. That's why farmers in Western Australia are fed up: 'I can't handle this anymore.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not everywhere do people have the opportunity to say, 'I'm not going to run sheep anymore.' Perhaps they could run cattle. But, in fact, this decision affects the cattle industry too, because the cattle in Western Australia, in the south, that are exported out live are actually travelling on the live sheep ships. So there'll be no ships for them, and I expect this to kick through to the cattle industry as well, when the boats cease. They don't all have that option, but a lot of them do. There's very fine agricultural land throughout Western Australia. They can grow crops instead, so, in terms of feeding the world, I suppose others will argue that the farmers are still growing stuff and whatever. But what they're not allowed to do is actually run the farming system that they want to run. This is taking away the options. It's taking away balanced management of farmlands, and that's very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At that time, when that confidence collapsed, they started pushing stock over the border to South Australia. I don't know what the current rate is of stock coming into South Australia. I was talking to a prominent Western Australian agricultural identity the other day; he was in South Australia, drumming up support for the Keep the Sheep campaign—I'll get to that a little bit later. He said: 'I feel bad. I've punted 6,000 lambs over the border through to Thomas Foods down at Murray Bridge. We had to get rid of them. We had to get them off the properties because everybody is trying to unload sheep in Western Australia at the moment. I know that's had a serious effect on the South Australian market. I feel bad telling South Australian growers that, but it is really between a rock and a hard place.' I said: 'Don't feel bad about it. I think everybody understands in South Australia that you are being forced into this position.' It's worth noting it costs about $35 a head to ship sheep from Western Australia to South Australia, and some of them are going through to New South Wales—I presume that's $55 or $60 a head—and the farmer has to absorb that cost. It's smashed the South Australian market, so it's much more than just a Western Australian issue. There is interest in South Australia in bringing the boat trade back for exactly the same purposes that exist in Western Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the government appointed an independent committee to go to Western Australia and advise the government on how they were going to phase out the industry—not if they were going to phase out the industry but how they would go about it. They sent this independent committee over there—no minister, no Labor backbenchers and no courage to go and face Western Australians and tell them to their faces that they were going to abolish the industry. In that light, the coalition backbench ag committee, of which I am the current chair, decided it would go to Western Australia instead. First of all, we held a meeting in Adelaide. Around 100 people turned up for that; people say this is a Western Australia thing, but we had 100 people turn up in South Australia. As part of that meeting I organised for a grower from Western Australia, Steve Bolt, to come to South Australia. He's in the eye of the storm. He's a producer, and he's been one of the public faces of the campaign in Western Australia. He put it in a nutshell for me. He said the Western Australian industry on average produces 125 per cent of the requirement of their slaughter chain. This means that, in a time of undersupply, they have enough animals available for the industry to keep their slaughter chain open all the time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens when you've got undersupply in that situation? The price goes up and the ships disappear; they go and ship sheep from other countries. But when you've got an oversupply situation, and the price trends down and farmers need to offload their sheep but not pay $60 per head to get them through to New South Wales, the ships come back. They put a floor in the market, which is about $120 or $130 per head. That's why it's the safety valve that Western Australia needs. It is perfect. It covers back and puts a floor in the market. Currently, because they can't keep up, it's down well below that point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is the government thinks you can build new abattoir capacity. The abattoirs will thrive when there's an oversupply situation, but what happens when, inevitably, there is an undersupply situation, when we've had a recovery of drought or whatever it might be? You close the abattoir—somebody has invested millions and millions of dollars to build an abattoir—and put the staff off. I can tell you: it's hard enough to staff an abattoir on a good day, let alone to tell your workers to nick off for 18 months or so while the sheep trade comes back and then be expected to re-recruit skilled staff at that stage. It simply will not work. This will be a death spiral for the industry. When they've got undersupply an abattoir, a slaughter chain, will shut. And when they've got oversupply farmers will start to exit the industry. It's difficult for me to see how the WA industry thrives without this safety valve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was probably an average of 100 people arriving at seven different meetings across Western Australia. They were confused, angry and unbelieving that a government would scuttle an industry which had turned itself inside out meeting new requirements coming towards it. There is no science that can possibly justify this phase-out. We have lower stocking rates on board. We have increased ventilation. We have onboard vets. We have specifically designed feed. We have a northern summer ban. And we have—get this, Deputy Speaker Goodenough—onboard stock hospitals. When vets are wandering past pens on a daily basis, if they see a sheep that is looking a bit peaky, not on its feed, they'll get that little beastie and take him up to the hospital and give him a shot of this or that. That's why the onboard mortality rates are now on the same level as an on-land feedlot, which is first class and which is not much different to having sheep out in the paddock, quite frankly. So there is no science and no good reason to shut down this industry anymore. It is a purely political ploy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This industry supplies more than 3,000 regional jobs. These are not jobs in large, central abattoirs; these are jobs out in the regions. And I can tell you, as someone who represents regions, that one of the toughest things I have had to confront while being the member for Grey is the decline of our inland towns. Anything that takes jobs out of a small inland town, I'm against. I cannot stand by and let that happen without passing judgement on it, as I do in this particular case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who have friends in the city and want up-to-date information on what the live export industry looks like, I urge them to visit the Livestock Collective website, where they can see video footage of stock on board today—not from 13 years ago, as the parliamentary committee heard about recently, from a vet that worked onboard ships between 2005 and 2011 or thereabouts. The committee accepted information from a vet who hasn't been on board a ship in 11 years as being up to date. It simply is not up to date. It is old news.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a first-class industry. It sets the standard, as the member for Cowper talked about, with our ESCAS, which actually traces our livestock overseas and has led to investment in new abattoirs and better handling practices in other countries. We are the only country that insists on down-chain upskilling of workforce in the handling of stock. Shutting down the Australian export trade will not lessen the numbers of those that actually go on ships around the world. It will just mean they don't come from Australia and they're not treated in an appropriate manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At those hearings in March, we heard the cry of Western Australian farmers. We said to them: 'We will fight your battle here in Canberra to our utmost, but we can't win on our own. You've got to be prepared to fight as well.' They've taken that advice on board, or perhaps they were going to do it anyway—I don't claim to be the author of all of these great outcomes—and they have now launched this Keep the Sheep campaign. Over 60,000 people have already signed the petition, and it's raised around $400,000. The Keep the Sheep campaign is determined to take this battle into the next election and to the marginal electorates in Western Australia. We think there are five or six of them that they will campaign in. They will wear T-shirts that will say something along the lines of, 'Keep me on the land,' 'Support Keep the Sheep,' or 'Keep the industry that supports you and supports Western Australia.' I imagine there are five or six Western Australian Labor members right at this moment that are going: 'What the dickens have we done? Prime Minister, do we really have to do this?' Let's hope they can change their minds, but it doesn't look they will. We know what happens to insurrectionists in the Labor Party: they get thrown out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the live sheep trade that's under siege in Australia. I talked about growers being sick of interference. There's the recommencement of indiscriminate water buybacks along the Murray-Darling Basin. There's the closing of the fully sustainable Gulf of Carpentaria gillnet fishery. There's the building of 10,000-plus kilometres—maybe 28,000 kilometres—of high-transmission lines and energy parks across the farmlands of Australia. There's the abolition of the Native Title Respondents Scheme, and this was brought up with me by three councils last week that feel as though they have been completely disempowered. There's the reduction in the instant tax write-off, and imposing biosecurity levies on farmers. We've simply had enough, quite frankly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think that the Labor Party hate farmers. As I said, I started off talking about the member for Paterson. I think they actually quite like us. I don't think they want to abolish farmers. I'm pretty sure they realise that farmers are quite useful to the nation. But I do think that they think farmers and agriculture are a totally tradable chip. It's a chip in a game of poker. They think farmers drive four-wheel drives and they've got big budgets to put those crops in. They send their kids away to school. They think they're, obviously, filthy, stinking rich. They think farmers will whinge for a while because that's what farmers do, but they'll be alright. Well, they're wrong. You can only push them so far. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know many farmers that are struggling to balance the books. It's not easy being a farmer, and the input costs are through the roof—and a lot of those are actually delivered courtesy of the government. And then the farmers find that the Labor Party did a deal with the Animal Justice Party for preferences at the last election on the basis that Labor commit to phasing out, getting rid of, the live sheep trade. And guess what? They are now negotiating—this is the Animal Justice Party, not me—to get rid of the live cattle trade. This is a disgrace. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="198084" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  I thank the member for Grey for his contribution but also, as the chairman of the coalition policy committee on agriculture, for bringing that committee to Western Australia, as he said, in March. We had a series of meetings around WA regional areas—I think six or seven different meetings—and, as the member for Grey said, they were very well received because the farmers of Western Australia are feeling hurt, they're feeling frustrated and they're feeling kicked around, and at least to be able to turn up and have someone who frequents this place listen to them and take their concerns on board was, I think, a great fillip to them at that point in time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we are here today debating the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024, which is what those farmers that we spoke to in Western Australia desperately wanted to avoid happening. We've seen, since those meetings across Western Australia, a very difficult start to the season. It's starting to pick up now. We've had some winter fronts come through. But there was a very difficult period through April and May where farmers were under extraordinary pressure and weren't able to quit sheep. Processing was overbooked, with months-long waiting lists. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, under the legislation which we are debating today, the adjustment package actually includes a $6.7 million mental health component. Now, I'm not too sure how many pieces of legislation we've stood up and passed through this place, and certainly while we've been in government I can't recall where, by our own admission, we were going to inflict serious mental health issues upon a particular section of the community. But that is what is contained in this bill—an admission that the farmers of Western Australia are already under incredible pressure, as the member for Grey said, and are going to be under even more pressure now and might require these services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, interestingly, the Western Australian agriculture minister has said in the parliament that she can't see how she can work constructively with the federal minister, so I'm not sure who's going to deliver these mental health services. Normally, it would be a state government. In the case of Western Australia, the Mental Health Commission would deliver this assistance to those farmers who require it. The federal government are going it alone because the state have said, 'This legislation is clearly going to impact negatively on the WA farming community,' so they've said that they are not going to work with the federal government. WA minister Jackie Jarvis has said that very clearly. So I'm not sure who's going to deliver that package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people who have spoken on this bill, particularly those on the other side, do not have any particular understanding of how this industry works—and I don't blame them for that—and why the live sheep component of the Western Australian self-replacing merino flock is fundamental to the profitability and ongoing viability of that industry. Eighty per cent of the sheep that are run across Western Australia are merinos. Merinos are bred not for meat—although that's considered to be a byproduct—they're bred to produce wool. When a merino eats a kilo of food, most of the energy it consumes goes towards producing wool and only a small proportion goes towards producing meat. A crossbreed or a British-bred lamb, or a shedding sheep—an exotic sheep—has completely different genetics. They're bred to put the larger proportion of that energy into growing meat and fat, and those are the sheep that the processor is seeking when they go into the marketplace to buy sheep. Bear in mind that 80 per cent of the sheep in Western Australia are merinos, and that's a major component of the flock. It has fallen because of lower wool prices since 1990, with the collapse of the reserve price scheme. The Western Australian flock has fallen from 30 million sheep in its heyday to 12.9 million sheep, I think, at the start of this year. It's estimated it will be down to 12.2 million at 30 June, but, interestingly enough, the Wool Forecasting Committee forecasts numbers to drop to nine million sheep at 30 June 2025 and 7.2 million at 30 June 2026.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, effectively, we're not just looking at the demise of the WA sheep industry, because once we get down to those numbers we lose critical mass and even the processors that we spoke to at the recent House Standing Committee on Agriculture hearings in Muresk in Northam admitted that once we go below a critical mass it's hard to keep processing plants going. It's very hard for them to be viable and, as the member for Grey said, we can't turn these things on and off; we have to keep the workforce working for 11 months of the year. There's a one-month shutdown when we do maintenance and so on, and then everyone comes back from their holidays and we go for another 11 months. That's the only way to maintain a viable abattoir. So once sheep numbers in WA fall below a certain level and those abattoirs can't keep going for that period of time then their viability goes out the window and we see the sheep industry contract even further and go even further downhill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why it's such an important industry; the merino industry is far more labour-intensive than either the lamb industry or, indeed, the cropping industry. Other evidence that we heard from various farm lobby groups was that the assumptions by the department of agriculture, that sheep producers will move from merino sheep to fat lamb sheep or meat sheep, is actually a false dichotomy. That's because sheep are actually in competition with cropping acres. That's the way these mixed farming operations work, and it's another reason why sheep numbers have dropped—because cropping has become more attractive. Machinery and techniques have improved; Western Australia produced a record crop of over 24 million tonnes in 2022, massively up from previous crops because we're getting better at it. The machinery is getting better and more technical, and the techniques are getting more tailored to the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What will actually happen is not that people will move from merino sheep today; once they lose that live export market, they'll move to cropping acres, which, once again, means lower numbers of sheep.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is that important? Why does that matter? Because the inland rural towns across my electorate of O'Connor, the member for Durack's electorate and also the member for Forrest's electorate, rely on the labour force that supports the sheep industry. It's a highly labour-intensive industry compared to cropping and meat sheep. Once we lose those shearing teams, the trucking contractors, the mulesing contractors, the stock-handling contractors and the stock agents, there's not much left in those rural communities. They're already in decline and struggling to keep the schools open. Once they lose a couple of families out of the school, the next thing is that they've lost their school. And once they've lost their school, how do they attract people to come and work in their town? If they have a family, what do they do? They aren't going to send a primary schoolkid away to a boarding school or to a hostel at the government schools in Albany or Narrogin. They just can't attract people to come and work in those towns. That's why it's so important that we continue to keep the industry viable and to keep those jobs happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on the animal welfare issue. We all know that we're here because of the incident on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>; it has been mentioned by many others. A lot of Western Australian farmers still want to hear what actually transpired between Animals Australia and the whistleblower. There was a lot of money that changed hands. There were allegations made by another whistleblower that the footage was contrived and that it was manufactured because of the amount of money—we're talking around US$107,000—paid to a deckhand whose monthly salary was US$350.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not a lawyer, but I'd reckon that any evidence that was produced in a court of law that had been obtained by that sort of money changing hands would be considered to be tainted. Anyway, that is an issue which we'll continue to pursue. I have 52 questions on notice to the department of agriculture which they have brushed off with a statement of a couple of paragraphs. However, I will not let this issue lie. I can say that to the people at the department of agriculture and others in the minister's office. We'll continue to pursue this until we get a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that incident, there have been dramatic changes to the way that the animal welfare and the conditions on these boats are conducted. These have made an enormous difference. Things like the stocking density in the pens and the ventilation as measured by the pen air turnover have made an enormous difference, as have the supervision and the reporting on these voyages. The wet bulb temperatures on each deck are recorded every hour; everything about the voyage is recorded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the recent House standing committee inquiry, we took evidence from some vets that were part of the Animals Australia, RSPCA and Vets Against Live Export group. One of those vets, Dr Lynn Simpson, alleged that feed shortages on the boats were leading to animals dying of starvation. She also suggested inanition, which is animals not feeding—specifically, that sheep are not accustomed to eating pelleted ration. We had Dr Jane Vaughan, who stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sheep exhibit heat stress in the majority of equatorial crossings … This was demonstrated in 37 of 41 independent observer report summaries between 2018 and 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She said that temperatures on voyages with little diurnal reprieve mean that sheep are experiencing heat stress conditions. She also described manure pads:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Damp, wet, tacky, sticky, sloppy faecal bedding is all indicative that sheep are failing to dissipate heat adequately.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the evidence that we heard at the inquiry on Wednesday the 12th here in Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Subsequent to that, Dr Herbert Rebhan, who is a veterinary surgeon, made a rebuttal submission to the inquiry. He was the registrar for production animals at Murdoch University's veterinary school from 2008 to 2014; from 2014 to 2019, he worked for the department of agriculture in the live animal export division in Perth; and, from March 2020 to November 2023, he worked as a shipboard Australian-accredited veterinarian on live sheep export voyages. He said, 'During this time, I cared for sixteen voyages that exported 899,315 sheep.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to a couple of the points that Dr Rebhan made in response to the allegations from Dr Simpson and Dr Vaughan. He said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My mortality rate ranged from 0.08% to 0.29%, averaging 0.19% (Two sheep out of one thousand). To put this into perspective, the mortality goals on a sheep farm are &lt;2% for the rams and weathers and &lt;3% for ewes and feedlot lambs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over my sixteen voyages, the total number of sheep hospitalized and treated was 2182, of which 2056 (94%) walked off the ship healthy and in market condition.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the sheep that are identified in a pen that are looking a little bit weak or thrifty. They are taken out of the pen, they are put into the hospital pen and they are treated.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to close by saying Mr Rebhan is an American. He studied and did his degree in America. In America, they swear an oath as a vet, similar to what doctors here in Australia do—the Hippocratic oath. The oath is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the guts of what, as a vet in the United States, your oath is. He goes on to say over and above the oath:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I'm disgusted with the lies and deceitful tactics used by those with little to no firsthand experience or knowledge of the live sheep export industry who are trying to shut it down.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch finally on the Keep the Sheep movement, which has sprung up. I know that many on the other side, particularly those on the east coast, would look at 60,000 sign-ups in the first month—$350,000 raised without a great deal of effort on their behalf—but let me tell you: this movement is a political movement which is gaining strength. It is the proxy for many farmers who are not involved with the live sheep export trade—they might be cattle producers and others—to get behind this and say: 'We have to draw a line in the sand here. If we allow the government to shut down a perfectly legal industry which has done everything that has been asked of it by the regulator, then what industry is next?' Is it cattle? We know that the animal welfare lobby are going after cattle next. They have made that very clear. Is it glyphosate in the cropping program? Is it atrazine in canola programs? So this movement is real. It's going to be effective, and I give it my 100 per cent support. So #keepthesheep.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300006" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHANEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  This bill has been closely watched, discussed and debated in my electorate of Curtin. I've been inundated with emails and calls from farmers, current and retired, and those involved in the live sheep export industry who don't want the market to end, as well as inundated with emails and calls from constituents who want to see the market end as soon as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear to all that the halting of the live sheep export industry will disproportionately affect Western Australia and Western Australians. WA has been the only state exporting live sheep since 2019. According to the WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development, in 2023, 12 per cent of sheep disposals by WA producers were by live sheep export. In relatable numbers, this means that nearly 671,000 sheep were exported, which contributed $70 million to the economy. Geographically, WA is isolated from the large eastern states' sheep market and, for the last 50 years, has exported live sheep as an integral part of the sheep industry. So it's understandable that WA sheep farmers are very concerned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because this is such a divisive topic in my electorate, I've been trying to learn as much as I can from all sides of the debate to ensure I can make a positive and pragmatic contribution. In December last year, I held a live sheep export round table where I invited a farmer, a representative from the Australian Livestock Exporters Council, a vet, an academic and a representative from the RSPCA into a room together to discuss the, at that stage, proposed ban. Needless to say, after a 90-minute discussion, I came to the useful conclusion that it was very complicated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The attendees who were in favour of continuing the live sheep export made some good points: animal welfare in the sheep industry is now better than it used to be and better than many other countries that export sheep; the mortality rate on sheep ships is now fairly low; ending the live sheep trade will have a significant economic impact on many WA farmers; and live exported sheep play an important and integrated role in the viability of many WA farms. The attendees who were in favour of banning the live sheep export industry made the following points, which also seemed to stack up: it's hot on our sheep export routes to the Middle East, without much relief at night, and the sheep are likely to suffer heat stress; we don't have very sophisticated measures of distress and heat stress; the reform in the Australian live sheep industry has been largely reactive; and self-regulation doesn't seem to work particularly well, because of a lack of transparency and accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are a number of statements that were disputed by both sides, like whether the live sheep export decline in recent years has been because of the anticipation of a ban or if it was declining anyway. Also, there was conflicting data presented on public sentiment relating to live sheep export.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At its heart, this issue comes down to economics and livelihoods versus values and animal rights. This is not an argument where one side can convince the other. Those against the industry believe that the slaughter of sheep should happen as close to the farm gate as possible to reduce stress. Farmers who stand to lose financially believe this is a politically populist decision driven by the eastern states. As we know, in 2018, the ALP announced that it would phase out the live sheep export industry. It was a pre-election promise for the 2019 and 2022 elections. It is an ALP platform issue and I'm not going to argue against this position. I understand the animal rights concerns and I'm equally concerned by the stories of animal suffering. I've seen the figures that show the live sheep export market has been declining and sheepmeat exports have been increasing, so I will be supporting this bill before the House which will end live sheep exports by sea by 1 May 2028.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I want to discuss the government's announcement that it will commit $107 million to a transition support package to support the Western Australian sheep industry supply chain. I see my role as advocating for those in WA and in Curtin who are affected by this policy and making sure they get the best possible deal as they transition to a new industry. It's an unusual step to ban an industry, and farmers should be looked after during the transition. The transition is focused especially on the expansion of the Western Australian onshore processing market, with refrigerated product to be transported to international and domestic markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to represent the largely retired farmers in Curtin, I sought input on what the transition package should look like from Curtin constituents who contacted me in favour of keeping the live sheep trade. I asked three questions: Firstly, what are the biggest needs for affected farmers and others in the supply chain during the transition? Secondly, what's the best way to support more onshore processing of sheep in Western Australia? Thirdly, what other types of support should be included in the program?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased that so many constituents were willing to engage with this process. Based on the replies received, I've made a submission to the minister in relation to the transition package. All reiterated their dismay about the live sheep export phase-out. The feedback specific to the live sheep ban transition package illustrated a number of important points—firstly, the need for a long-term perspective. Constituents were clear that the focus should be on genuine transition rather than short-term cash handouts. Many considered the package grossly inadequate, especially given the need to apply to the entire supply chain, from farmers to exporters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, extensive planning is needed for abattoir infrastructure. Expanding onshore processing of sheep will require more abattoirs. The reality is abattoirs in Western Australia require migrant labour and associated accommodation to operate effectively. These are already proving to be very difficult in the current economic conditions. Infrastructure will need to be built and housing provided. The challenge for a successful transition to build this industry and provide farmers with an alternative is therefore significant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the mental health implications for communities need to be considered. Mental health support for affected individuals and communities will be required and will be significant. When livelihoods are jeopardised, the impacts cut deep and undermine whole communities, including schools and the social fabric of towns. These are tight-knit communities who pride themselves on looking out for each other. Transitioning workers and ensuring meaningful employment and opportunities tie in with this mental health support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, there are significant supply chain issues. The lack of refrigeration in largely Middle Eastern country importers need to be addressed to facilitate the market for packaged meat. Freight subsidies for processed meat should be considered, and new markets for processed meat need to be opened up to enable a proper transition pathway. Appropriate subsidies should be considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I recently supported a motion to refer this legislation to a committee because it will have a significant impact on the farmers affected. The size and make-up of the transition package needs to be carefully considered. I recognise that the ALP made the banning of this industry an election promise and is unlikely to reverse that decision and break its election promise, but I also recognise that banning an entire industry is a bold and unusual move. This is an industry that operates largely in Western Australia. Adequately supporting the transition is essential, and I will give voice to my affected constituents in this transition process. I urge the government to engage deeply with those affected and ensure we are finding viable alternatives to protect our important agricultural exports from Western Australia. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  There is a deep concern for animal welfare and safety amongst Warringah residents. This includes concern for the welfare of animals being shipped overseas as live exports. I have consistently said that it is our moral and ethical responsibility to bring an end to live animal exports. The science and research on the issues in the live animal trade is clear, showing the devastating impact on these animals. Our live export industry has consistently shown its willingness to condemn animals to extreme risk of suffering and death in the harshest of conditions. And, with temperatures ever rising during summer periods due to the climate crisis, we are already seeing examples from overseas where there are mass deaths of animals being transported in sweltering conditions. For example, during the 2022 UK summer, some 18,500 chickens died in transport, compared to 325 in the same period the previous year. It's clear the conditions are changing, and so too must the regulations and laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the efforts of the Independent member for Clark and others in this place who have kept advocating for an end to live animal exports. As I've said before, the standard you walk past is the standard you accept. This is an issue we have walked past for too long. It's also an issue that has been on the agenda for some time. So, whilst I appreciate there is a concern for many communities—and I will go to that in a moment—this is not a new development. This has been on the cards for some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the UK just last month a new law came into effect banning the export of live animals for slaughter, including their cattle, sheep and pigs. New Zealand brought a live animal export ban by sea into effect in April 2023. Now Australia is beginning to catch up. We have a proposed law before us to stop the export of live sheep from Australia, the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024. Now, let's be clear: it is not coming into effect immediately. It has a long lead time for that adaptation to occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's lamb and mutton export industry was worth some $4.5 billion last year, but live sheep exports by sea was, in fact, less than $77 million in 2023, so about 0.1 per cent of Australia's agricultural production. Historically, we've supplied a large volume of live sheep to Middle Eastern countries, peaking at around $415 million over two decades ago. The overall volume of live sheep exports by sea has been decreasing steadily over the last two decades, dropping by 27 per cent between 2018 and 2019, and then again in 2022-23. Over the last two decades our sheepmeat exports have grown in value by over 300 per cent—that is processed, not live animals—including exports to the North Africa and Middle East region, more than tripling in those situations in value over this period. This means there is a market for processed meats, and there are more jobs in the meat processing and slaughter industry available to Australians. That is where the opportunity lies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia has been Australia's only source of live sheep exports by sea since 2019-20. It now directly employs fewer than 100 people, but I do appreciate that there are communities and farms where it's a long family tradition that will be significantly impacted. It does set the scene, though, when we appreciate the constantly decreasing size of this industry and when we start appreciating the growth in the processed meat industry. We can see where the opportunity is to combine economic opportunity, jobs opportunity and ethical and moral opportunity to stop this inhumane treatment of animals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government commissioned an independent report into the phase-out of live sheep exports by sea, which reported back in October last year. That report acknowledged the polarised feeling in the community on the issue of live export bans, in particular, from those Western Australian communities. However, the review panel concluded that the WA sheep industry can remain viable and sustainable following a live export ban, provided there is appropriate government support. That's what this bill puts into effect. It bans the live export of sheep by sea and provides support to those who will be affected by this change. Again, I appreciate there is debate and discussion in relation to the appropriateness of the support proposed by the government and whether or not this is adequate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to be clear, though, that it doesn't ban all live animal exports. Live sheep exports by air will continue. Exports of other animals, including live cattle, will continue by sea and/or air. Following the passage of this bill, sheep producers, related businesses and markets have a clear timeframe of four years to manage the transition from the trade into new activities. It is not like they're getting the rug pulled out from underneath them. There is a four-year transition period. This bill does provide certain support to affected stakeholders. The $107 million proposed transition support package will be necessary to assist all parts of the sheep industry supply chain, from farmers to truck drivers, shearers and meat processors, to adjust to that future without live sheep exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do hear, though, the concern in relation to the size of that transition package, in that it does not seem to be adequate when one considers the size of what is being lost and the number of areas that need to be covered. The industry was valued at around $77 million in 2022-23, so we should have a package from the government that ultimately helps create new opportunities to grow the domestic sheep-processing industry, grow local jobs and contribute to regional development. Already, the sheepmeat export industry is worth some $4.5 billion, so it clearly has the potential to take over and assist these communities in the transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this bill, but it is worth sensibly raising the issues it presents. Firstly, as I mentioned, I question the size of the support package at $107 million over five years. I would encourage the government to be open minded on whether further support will be needed to properly address the transition. Within the $107 million, the government has committed some $64 million over five years for supporting sheep producers and supply chain participants affected. If you start dividing that over those five years, it really does highlight that it is not a big support package, and so that really needs to be the focus of the government. This involves providing funding for more rural financial counsellors, expanding domestic sheepmeat-processing capacities and developing plans to help businesses re-orient their operations away from live exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that in WA, where 85 to 90 per cent of exports originate, the Premier has said that the ban of live sheep export would cost the relevant industries up to $123 million per year, implying that the government's $64 million over five years might be less than one-tenth of what is in fact needed. The government has also allocated some $27 million in funding over five years—again—to enhance demand for Australian sheep products in interstate and international markets, but this is unlikely to stretch far enough, given the diversity and unique needs of the various international markets. Again, we all know how to divide by five, so just announcing a number to be a package over the course of five years does not in itself make it a significant package. When we divide that up over five years, it's clear the package falls short in many areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also remain concerned that the live sheep export trade will continue in its current form for another four years without any caps or quotas and with only existing regulations in place. Unfortunately, we know those regulations are all too often inadequate and insufficient. I would strongly encourage the government to reconsider the lack of caps and quotas over the next four years and instead implement measures to achieve a gradual phase-out of live sheep exports over these next four years. The existing regulations that apply to live sheep exports appear to be inadequate, given the cases of inhumane treatment of sheep on ships seen as recently as January this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be considering the live export of cattle as well. I acknowledge that the live cattle export market was worth some $1.2 billion in the 2022-23 year, and there are much greater economic consequences of banning the live export of cattle by sea, but the government should still further consider what it can do to improve the welfare of cattle being exported overseas by ship. In many cases, cattle and sheep are transported on the same ships, and, in March this year, more than 100 Australian cattle died on a live export ship to Indonesia. That's one of the highest mortality rates ever reported on an Australian live cattle shipment. The government should be considering further measures to ensure the welfare of live cattle and all live animal exports to ensure that the inhumane treatment of animals is not occurring. Examples that have been proposed include mandating vets on all cattle shipments, as recommended by the RSPCA, or installing real-time monitoring systems to track cattle conditions, such as temperature, humidity and health indicators. Live cattle exporters should be required to plan optimal routes to reduce stress and health risks and also avoid transport during extreme weather conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will support this bill; it's a good start, but it's clear that there's a lot more work to be done to balance animal safety and welfare and to prevent cruelty within live export industries, particularly with the growing challenge from heat that we'll see as the world warms with the climate crisis. I absolutely support ensuring that communities which are being asked to change can do so with the support of government through packages that adequately meet the needs that they face.</span>

Our cattle producers would be very nervous if they were listening to that speech by the member for Warringah. They would be very, very nervous because, rest assured, once Labor, the teals and the Independents phase out the live sheep trade by sea, they'll be coming after cattle next. And then what?

                    </a>  Dog racing! I just heard 'dog racing' from the member for Warringah. It's because they want to ban everything. The dog-racing ban didn't work so well for the New South Wales government when they tried to implement that. The member for Warringah, who represents a sprawling electorate of 68 square kilometres in leafy coastal Sydney, would know all about the feelings of our cattle producers and the work that our sheep farmers do! I know—and I know that the member for Flynn knows, because he comes from cattle country. And the member for Wannon, who was a very, very good trade minister in the Morrison government for two years, represents an electorate which produces fine sheep, just like the Riverina produces. Why should our sheep markets here in the eastern states be affected by a decision made by this Labor government, albeit for over in Western Australia? But, rest assured, when the sheep are phased out, there's going to have to be something done with those sheep. They'll be shipped to the eastern states and our markets will suffer as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor, through a kneejerk reaction to a television program on the national broadcaster, shut down our live cattle trade in mid-2011, the cattle prices at Wagga Wagga slumped the next week. That's because they were fearful—and markets are driven by fear and greed. There were concerns that cattle from the northern part of Australia would end up in our saleyards, end up in our abattoirs and end up competing with the prices of our locally produced cattle in the Riverina. It's not too distant to say—and my local stock and station agents are already saying this—that a shutdown of the trade in the west will affect our markets in the east. It will affect our markets in Wagga Wagga. Just last December, because of any number of factors, sheep were selling for a dollar a head in the Wagga Wagga saleyards. Imagine trying to make a buck when your sheep are being sold for just a dollar. It doesn't even bear thinking about how much it cost you to transport those sheep to the yards, let alone paying the agents and all the rest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a folly. The Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System is in place and is working well, and it's something that other countries, which will now fill this trade, do not have in place. What we have is the situation where the sheep are very much looked after. The sheep have pens in which to move on the ships, and their panting, their breaths, are measured. They have veterinarians on board making sure that their welfare is first class. But that market will now be filled by countries which do not have the ESCAS system, or one like it, in place. What the teals and Labor would have you believe is that, well, Australian sheep will be okay, but to hell with those foreign-bred sheep. I say: shame on them!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was watching television last night—one of the rare opportunities I ever get to sit down and watch TV—and there was an advertisement by the RSPCA no less boasting about the fact that, because of their diligent work, free-range hens are now able to lay in peace and indeed pigs are able to have big pens in which they can roll around in the mud. The RSPCA, no doubt cheering this home too, was very satisfied with that outcome. This is the same organisation which twice visited a farm near Wagga Wagga where re-homed brumbies were being allegedly slaughtered. It is now the subject of a police inquiry and of another state government inquiry as well and that is a good thing. But the RSPCA saw no problems there. They pick and choose which animals they are going to look after and which animals they are not. Rest assured, sheep were being very well looked after when they were exported to the Gulf states. The trade minister knows that, the former trade minister knows that and everyone on this side speaking in favour of the amendments put to this bill knows that as well. Indeed, the minister, Senator Murray Watt, three days before the budget, skulked his way over to the west, did a Zoom meeting, didn't face up to the farmers, didn't eyeball the farmers, and announced this terrible, shameful policy which is going to see the trade shut down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the member for Rankin, just three days later, stood at that very dispatch box and said he was going to put up $107 million to stop farmers doing what they have done for generations. Think about that—$107 million to stop farmers farming. I mean, it makes no sense. The member for Warringah also stated in her contribution that there will be money for rural financial counsellors. We want to make sure the mental health and mental welfare of our farmers is everything it should be, not paying money to counsellors in Western Australia to go and see if those farmers are okay because the rug has been pulled from underneath them by this anti-agriculture government, and that is what Labor are. They are anti-agriculture, as evidenced by this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 3 June, Minister Watt wrote to the House Standing Committee on Agriculture and instructed it to conduct an inquiry into the bill. However, it only involved two public hearings, offered just a week for submissions and provided a report on 21 June, two weeks after the inquiry started. This is not stakeholder engagement. This is not consulting our farmers, who deserve better. Our exports need to be upheld just to pay for the cost-of-living crisis brought about by this government. And, of course, a rushed process led to the chair recommending support for the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal coalition stand in solidarity with Australian farmers. We always will. I am the son of a sheep farmer. I can just imagine what he would be thinking. The only time he ever protested in his life was when he came out the front here when the Hawke government came into power and was so anti-farmer, so anti-agriculture. It was the only time Dad ever protested.</span>

                    </a>  He was right to do it, member for Wannon, indeed he was. The coalition will reverse this ridiculous, insane decision. We will reinstate the live export industry when next we are elected to government, and hopefully that will be at the next election. I admire the police officer in Western Australia who is riding around on his motorcycle with a 'Keep the Sheep' sticker on his bike. That takes guts. That takes a bit of courage and well done to him for doing that. This is just nonsense. Even after the consultancy panel, an independent panel apparently, developed a report on the phasing out of the industry and submitted its final report to the Minister for Agriculture on 25 October, it took Labor more than six months to release it. Why the secrecy? It's because they knew about the backlash that they were going to cop and will cop right up until the next election and beyond for doing this, for phasing out live sheep exports. It's simply not good enough in this day and age when we've got the animal husbandry provisions in place. Those ships are very safe. In fact, those ships are so safe for sheep that more sheep die in paddocks on Australian farms than on those ships going to sea to those Gulf States.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  The Dohles Rocks Road on- and off-ramps in Griffin are one of the most eagerly awaited and anticipated infrastructure projects in the Petrie electorate. It's a very fast growing area in the Moreton Bay city. With more than 150,000 road users travelling this section daily, this project, when constructed, will benefit local commuters, freight drivers and holiday-makers. Residents in Griffin are crying out for this infrastructure. We've had a lot of rain in Queensland since the new year, the start of 2024, and, when it floods, the intersection at Dohles Rocks Road as you head southbound onto the highway goes underwater. As part of this project, it will be upgraded with an on-ramp north and an off-ramp south.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, this project is six years overdue. The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Dickson, Peter Dutton, and I, along with the help of the people of Murrumba Downs and Griffin, secured 80 per cent of the money for this project back when Malcolm Turnbull was the Prime Minister. That's how long ago it was. It was back in 2018. Do you think we can get any action out of the state Labor government or the local member, Steven Miles? There's been absolutely nothing.</span>

They're going to start it. I have to say that in 2018 we secured $120 million of the $150 million needed by the previous federal coalition government. Have a guess what the cost to build it is now. Six years later, it's $290 million. It has gone from $150 million to $290 million. The member for Wannon knows what I'm talking about, because he is from the great state of Victoria. The Queensland government's Department of Transport and Main Roads have said that they could have started this project a lot earlier. This should have been done straightaway.</span>

It's because of your determination and advocacy that we were able to get the state Labor government to start. The upgrade will see north-facing ramps to help increasing traffic and local connectivity. The project will make a big difference to those local communities. Steven Miles, the Labor Premier, has said that he basically wants people to forget the last nine years of his government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, two wonderful bowel cancer warriors from my electorate came to visit and advocate about the impacts of this cruel disease. Rachel Bernardo and Jodie Elisara from Deception Bay were both diagnosed with bowel cancer in their 30s. They are beautiful young women who you wouldn't expect to get cancer at such a young age. I was shocked when they told me about their symptoms and the fact that they were dismissed by multiple GPs who said they were both too young and not to worry. This is the case for many young people who are later diagnosed with bowel cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All the members of this House would know that bowel cancer is the deadliest cancer, and it's the sixth-leading cause of death overall for Australians aged 25 to 44. Early-onset bowel cancer in people diagnosed younger than 50 years of age accounts for 11 per cent of all new diagnoses. Bowel Cancer Australia's Never2Young's advocacy agenda seeks to improve care experiences and health outcomes for younger people by championing greater awareness; lowering the screening age from 50 to 45 and making sure that it's not opt-in but there for everyone; GP referrals for a colonoscopy for all young people who present with symptoms; improving pathways; better understanding of the challenges of early-onset bowel cancer; and further research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Too often, young Australians—people that we care about—have died of bowel cancer. I lost a friend, Sam Gunsser, to bowel cancer two years ago; he was in his 40s. I encourage constituents, if they'd like, to make a donation to Bowel Cancer Australia. It's 100 per cent community funded. All donations over $2 are tax deductible. They can donate at bowelcanceraustralia.org.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  The theme of this year's Refugee Week is 'finding freedom'. It highlights the role that family plays in the refugee experience. Refugee Week acknowledges and celebrates the remarkable resilience of refugees and people seeking asylum not only here in our Australian community but also beyond our shores, where it's estimated that today there are some 80 million displaced people on the move globally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia receives one of the highest numbers of refugees per capita in the world, and our refugee settlement program is second to none in the world. Australia is a welcoming country to those who have escaped the violence of war, persecution, the effects of climate and socioeconomic circumstances. Multiculturalism is about our unity within a culturally diverse Australia. Multiculturalism rejects divisive discourse, and Australians can be proud that our communities embrace and support those who have sought refuge and safety in our country. In my own electorate we have received some of the highest intakes of refugees from Iraq and Syria and other places of conflict around the world. More recently our community has received families and children fleeing the violence in Gaza. I want to pay tribute to the resilience and courage of my local refugee community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent this past week attending some of the many refugee events that have taken place in Calwell. Last week at the Good Samaritan Catholic Primary School the school community, under the amazing leadership of principal Paul Sedunary and vice-principal Leanne Murray, put on a morning tea for the refugee families that this wonderful school cares for, at a rate of 70 per cent of the overall student population. The school, in celebrating the resilience of its students and their families, created a video that captured the voice of recently arrived refugee families as they told their stories of leaving their home country, their journey and their settlement in Australia. This video, inspired by the theme 'Finding Freedom: Family', encapsulates the profound journey of resilience, strength and unity that defines the refugee experience by shedding light on the transformative power of familial bonds, emphasising the crucial role families play in providing solace, support and a sense of belonging to those forced to flee their home. This video will be used within the school community to help inform people within the Good Samaritan community of the enormity of the journey and the achievements of the local refugee community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vice-principal Leanne Murray, in her opening comments, stated:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We hear your stories, we learn from your journey, we keep in our prayers those still searching for freedom and those on the journey to freedom, we also keep in our hearts the many displaced people who are involved in the conflict in Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leanne went on to thank the families of the school students:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… for sharing your stories and trusting us to share in the care of your children, you teach us about courage, you teach us about resilience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our local refugee community have settled in the area, but the pain of displacement and loss is carried with them always. For my local refugee community, solace, comfort and hope is, in addition to the local service providers and community organisations, found in their places of worship. Theirs is a strong faith, and it's integral to their identity and connection to what they left behind, and the many family and friends that perished in the conflicts they fled from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I work with all our local faith leaders, and I want to recognise the importance and value of their stewardship to our local community and in particular to our local refugee community. I begin by thanking Father Thair, of Our Lady Guardian of Plants Chaldean Catholic Church, who was present at the morning tea at the Good Samaritan Catholic Primary School last week. I want to thank him for his work and dedication to his community. I also want to welcome Father Stephanos to our community. He himself arrived recently as a refugee from Syria and is using the Kalkallo Community Centre on a Sunday morning to administer mass to an emerging Antiochian Christian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to pay tribute to the celebration of Refugee Week at the Australian Chaldean Family Welfare association celebration event last Saturday. I want to thank Ms Dalal Sleiman, the chairperson of the association. We were given the opportunity to join with members of our culturally diverse communities to hear stories of courage, survival and relief from the many refugees present. I want to thank everyone in my community for embracing our multiculturalism, supporting community harmony and building the unity that defines the refugee experience and contributes to our social cohesion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="235654" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOLAHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  I rise to do something that often happens in this place, which is to take you, those here in the chamber and those watching at home, on a journey. I'd like to take you on a journey in time to one particular date, and I hope all of us remember it. It's 16 November 2005. Australia hadn't made the World Cup yet, and we had this huge game against Uruguay in Sydney. We were down a goal. We had to score at least one for the home goal in order to go to penalties and more than that to win in our own right. For a while, we weren't sure that would happen. We've seen this movie play out so many times before, where Australia got so close and fell short. But, in the 33rd minute, Mark Bresciano scored the goal that led us to penalties and that great moment when we went on to the World Cup.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People focus on John Aloisi, but I want to single out Mark Bresciano. For him to be there at that moment, at that time, and strike the goal into the net didn't happen by accident; it happened because of the love, affection and work of him, his family and the Italians in my electorate. Mark Bresciano was a proud member of the Bulleen football club. The Bulleen football club and the Veneto Club are one and the same. Recently, I had the great honour of being at the Bulleen football club's 50th anniversary gala dinner. There was Mark Bresciano! He was there acknowledging and thanking the people who made him the superstar that he is. When he stood up, he spoke with humility and gratitude first to his parents and then to everyone who mentored him—the people that he looked up to, the club that nourished him—and then said that, of all the things that meant something to him, that club meant so much. You could hear a pin drop in the room. I want to thank Mark Bresciano. I want to thank the Bulleen Lions and all of the parents, volunteers and coaches who have made that club the success that it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaker, I took you to 16 November 2005, but the seeds of that great moment started in 1974, when the Veneto Club was founded on 16 acres of land in Bulleen. It's where Italian migrants came and wanted a home away from home in which to gather, eat great food, have fantastic coffee and play the sport they're so good at and passionate about: football—or, as Australians call it, soccer. But, in my electorate, it's called football. When they did that, they were planting seeds for a future that mattered to their children and their grandchildren, and I saw them there in that moment. I saw them there watching Mark Bresciano, one of their own, say how much that club meant to him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Veneto Club is about the Australian dream. The club itself is quite distinct. If you drive up what is now the construction site of the North East Link, it stands out. It's amazing brutalist architecture designed by a very famous Italian architect Ermin Smrekar. You can't miss it. You can tell that thing has been built to last. When the club celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, the president Lou Kremer and his team were there. People from all around the world, particularly from the Veneto region in Italy, gathered to acknowledge this momentous occasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was there, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the club, there were some other great events to celebrate, other than the national ones that we know about. In 1987, they won the division 1 championship by one point against Ringwood City. In 1993 they became known as the Bulleen Lions. They won the premier's and the championship cup that year. Now they have a vibrant girls and women's team, and they're leading the way and breaking barriers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all the parents who cut the oranges, who wash the tops, who stand behind the bar, who run the sausage sizzle, who drive their kids all around Melbourne on weekends, I want to say: thank you. When the nation stops at that key moment, it is because of you. It is because of the Bulleen Lions, the Veneto Club, and the great Italian diaspora of our nation, of Melbourne and of my electorate in particular. I salute you, I am very proud of you, and I congratulate you on your anniversary.</span>

On 12 July last year the Albanese Labor government officially declared the zone, paving the way for cleaner, cheaper energy into the grid and job security for those in the Hunter Region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Newcastle last week, I welcomed the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, who announced the next stage of this orderly process that the Labor government is undertaking. We announced the granting of a feasibility licence to the Novacastrian Offshore Wind Farm, which is a joint project between a Norwegian company, Equinor, and Australia's Oceanex Energy. Environmental and other approval processes will follow, as they should, and there will be lots of time for community groups to be involved in consultations prior to any construction occurring. The opportunities for the community, along with First Nations people, to provide feedback kicks in now. Along with the opinions of our organised labour movement and marine users in our region, this will be very important feedback for the Labor government to consider. We are ensuring that there is a thorough and transparent process for the life of this project, because this is a government that cares deeply about getting this transition right. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Novacastrian wind project is expected to generate up to two gigawatts of wind energy—enough to power an estimated 1.2 million homes. For those of us in Newcastle, we might call that enough to power two Tomago smelters. You know what? When you come from a region with some heavy industry—</span>

                  </a>  Members opposite might want to listen to this. When you come from a region that actually does industry, a region that is well versed at generating, storing and distributing energy in Australia, you might want to listen to what communities like ours have to say, because it's the people of Newcastle—not those here that want to bury their heads in the sand—that are going to lead the way in this nation on how to do this transition, how to do it well and how to do it right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Communities like mine have a lot of skin in this game. We've got a lot at stake here. But we have the highly skilled workforce. We know how to generate, store and distribute energy as needed. We've got a world-class university and an outstanding TAFE system to educate the next generation of people working in the new energy sectors. We've got the strong, consistent offshore winds, which are obviously pretty important for the setting up of any wind farm. We've got the deepwater port of Newcastle, which knows well the need to diversify its economic base. And we've got the proximity to the grid and all of the key critical infrastructure that is required. So when people ask me, 'If this is so good, why isn't it in Sydney?' I explain exactly the reason that it's going to be in a region like Newcastle. It's because energy is what we do. We've been doing it for generations and generations, and now we're going to keep doing it with a different form of energy. That's how it's going to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will tell you why people in Newcastle are pretty excited, and members opposite might want to listen to this. They are pretty keen about the 3,000 jobs that will be provided during the construction phase of offshore wind, and we are pretty damn excited about the 200 or 300 permanent jobs that will be there maintaining and supplying those offshore winds. My maritime workers in Newcastle are very excited about having some jobs, because those opposite cut their jobs, decimated Australian shipping and gave them no hope for the future, but not under the Albanese Labor government. We understand well the benefits of offshore wind and what it can bring to our communities. This is a brand new industry we are trying to stand up in Australia, so there are some genuine questions, but don't be fooled by the misinformation and disinformation that is continuously spread by members opposite. Your new-found love of marine life fools no Novocastrians. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  The Albanese Labor government have shown disdain for the digital economy in many aspects but one of the most important is their conspicuous failure to deliver on the Consumer Data Right, which was an important micro economic reform initiated under the previous coalition government. The Consumer Data Right allows consumers to safely share the data that businesses hold about them. It helps consumers compare between products and services to find offers that best meet their needs. It encourages competition between providers, leading to more innovative products and services. It is an opt-in service—nobody is compelled to use it—and it is buttressed by strict privacy and security provisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Consumer Data Right already operates in the banking and energy sectors, thanks to the hard work and heavy lifting done by the previous coalition government. So if you are a banking customer—and let's face it, just about every Australian is—you can use the Consumer Data Right to find a bank with a product or service that best suits your needs, and you do that by authorising your data, showing personal history of transactions, payments, receipts, to be made available to such banks as you authorise and allow, in turn, for it to be determined which bank has the best product or service to meet your needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side saw great value in the Consumer Data Right. We invested $111.3 million to accelerate the rollout of it as part of our digital economy strategy. According to a recent report by Fintech Australia and MasterCard, 99 per cent of all bank accounts are connected to the Consumer Data Right. Unfortunately, though, under this Labor government, the project has stalled. As the<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>Mandarin, the online news publication, reported last year, the Albanese government had quietly applied the handbrake to the expansion of the Consumer Data Right and the plans to take it into the superannuation sector, the insurance sector and telecommunications sector. Those plans, sadly, are now on pause, even though the project received $88 million in the 2023-24 federal budget. This is very disappointing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an insight into what is at stake, a report released earlier this year by Deloitte entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Consumer </span><span style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ata </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">volution: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">mpowering Australia's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span style="font-style:italic;">uture</span>, argued that the industry would be $16.7 billion larger by 2043 if the Consumer Data Right were to be expanded beyond the banking and energy sectors. The report also estimates that there would be 46,800 additional jobs generated due to the combined effect of greater competition and innovation by enabling cross-sector data sharing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This poor performance by Labor is disappointing but not entirely surprising. This is, after all, a government that does not have a digital economy strategy. It does not have a minister for the digital economy. Nor is it entirely surprising that the minister with responsibility in this area is the deeply underwhelming Assistant Treasurer and financial services minister, the member for Whitlam. He is not known for his passionate commitment to reforming energy. In fact, just about every project he is involved in has hurdles and roadblocks, such as the Modernising Business Registers program, which he axed last year, a program which sought to save business owners time and money by consolidating a range of business and company registers. The decision to abolish that program is very much to the detriment of Australia's much-needed digital transformation and our digital economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When he delivered his second reading speech for the Treasury Laws Amendment (Consumer Data Right) Bill last year, the member for Whitlam referred to the consumer data right as a game changer, and that is in fact an accurate statement of its potential. But has the potential been realised under this hapless and inept minister? Absolutely not. He's deployed all of his experience as a former trade union official, one of the many who infest the opposition benches—</span>

It's perhaps not surprising that a survey of financial advisers last year found the member for Whitlam to be the worst performing minister out of the last six to hold the portfolio. So I say to this government and I say to the member for Whitlam: improve your dismal performance and get on with the digital transformation of our economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  It wasn't a pleasant surprise for Blue Mountains residents and our Lithgow neighbours to learn that the coalition has selected their city as the site for a nuclear reactor. It defies logic that anyone would contemplate a nuclear reactor on the doorstep of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage area. There was no consultation with the people of Lithgow, let alone their neighbours. In the vacuum of silence that the opposition have left on their 23rd energy policy—what will be built, how many will be built, how much it will cost, when it'll be ready, how much power it would provide—I'm going to offer some facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All the experts say that nuclear energy is a bad idea for Australia. It's too slow and too expensive. Like international assessments, the CSIRO has found that the cheapest electricity comes from a grid that draws 90 per cent of its power from renewables, and it's close to half the cost of large nuclear reactors. We know that nuclear plays a role in some countries, but those countries all have an existing, mature nuclear industry, and they have something else in common: poor renewable resources. Nuclear will never stack up in Australia, because we have the world's best renewable resources, and we need to replace retiring coal urgently. We don't have time to wait another decade or more to bring new sources of energy into the grid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under their own optimistic scenario, the Liberals say that they won't get their first nuclear reactor up and running until 2035-2037, risking 13 years of rolling blackouts as they abandon reliable renewables. And, if they did hit their 2037 target, it would be the fastest nuclear rollout in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The waste is another problem. Unlike opposition claims about a can of Coke, it's actually about that much for every person the nuclear reactor is creating power for each year. So that's thousands of cans of Coke each year to be disposed of and, on average, around 30 tonnes of used fuel a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just call this what it is: a clumsy attempt to slow down investment in renewables and undermine confidence in the energy transformation that is already underway. It's a policy that will stick people with higher energy costs for longer and risk reliability. Australia's already halfway to meeting our 2030 emissions reduction target, with about 25 per cent more renewable energy in the national grid right now. We've doubled the approval of renewable projects, and coal and gas project approvals have fallen to a quarter of what they were. So this is what's actually happening in the real world, and it shows that the energy transition is underway. It's real, it's already happening, and that's the way we make energy cheaper and greener.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many people affected by Hawkesbury-Nepean flooding, whether it's Emu Plains, Ebenezer, Windsor or Wilberforce, I want to see tangible changes that make the valley a safer place to live. I'm now seeing the state and federal governments doing more to tackle flood mitigation and preparation than at any time in my 15 years in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, there's the release of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River flood study, the most comprehensive flood study done in New South Wales, reinforcing that we have one of the highest flood risks in the country. It's there for everyone to use, and the detailed data will be used in planning by Hawkesbury and Penrith councils and other levels of government, including in the work on the first regional disaster adaptation plan that's been developed for the valley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the $94.7 million investment in the SES which Premier Chris Minns joined me in the Hawkesbury to discuss. It's the largest ongoing commitment in the SES's history to help prepare for floods that can be far worse than what we've experienced in the last few years. It'll buy new equipment, support training and volunteer recruitment, and improve public information and warnings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the roads upgrades. Federal funding, which has helped the state identify and problem-solve more than a hundred road weaknesses, is aimed at improving drainage, lifting local roads and increasing culverts so roads stay open for longer during an evacuation. These are really tangible steps that are being taken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together the state and federal governments are building the new Richmond Bridge, which will be around 10 metres higher than the existing one and will be able to withstand a one-in-20-years flood, and we're improving evacuation routes via the Driftway. There's more to do, like the Pitt Town evacuation route, and it will take time, but it's happening under Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="text-align:center;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  The Sunshine Coast may indeed be the lifestyle capital of Australia, and indeed it's a beautiful, wonderful place to live, but the residents I serve here in this parliament are doing it as tough as any people are. Over the last two years, they've seen food prices and housing prices rise by over 10 per cent, insurance prises rise by well over 20 per cent and electricity prices rise by well over 30 per cent. Things are biting, and they're biting really hard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I had three days at the Sunshine Coast Agricultural Show and, there, had the privilege of talking with hundreds of constituents. The key message that came from them to me was that they're doing it tough. I'm seeing it myself with people I know. As I mix with other parents at school and so forth, I hear that people are doing it tough. You've got families who have cancelled their holidays this year. They can't afford it. I'm talking to senior citizens who are not even turning on the heater this winter, because they can't afford to do it. I'm talking about small businesses closing their doors. They can't keep things afloat. They're doing it tough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result, I've recently launched a community initiative asking my own local community if they have ideas for how government can ease their cost-of-living pressures—'Please come forward; let's have a chat about it.' Indeed, tedobrien.com.au, my website, is receiving a lot of input from constituents, and times like the sunny coast agricultural show and my own road trips around the electorate provide those opportunities. We cannot underestimate the importance of good ideas coming from local communities. Indeed, my own local community has already seen changes in Australian tax law because of ideas they put forward, especially with respect to men's sheds and women's sheds. Even how the then government dealt with JobKeeper through the COVID pandemic, especially facilitating payments to small businesses through the banks, came from ideas generated on the ground from Fairfax constituents on the Sunshine Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have a situation right now where Australians are feeling a lot poorer than they were feeling two years ago before the Albanese government came to power. There's a reason for that: they are poorer. But, if they can please reach out, make their concerns clear and put forward their ideas, they will be listened to and taken up where we can.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  I would like to mark the passing earlier this year of a true Labor hero in my electorate, Christina Lillian Phillis. Christina died peacefully in Alice Springs. From a very young age, politics and religion guided Christina and became the foundation stone of her deep faith and unbending commitment to achieving justice for all people. After moving to Whyalla in 1976 with her husband, a railway station master and having four growing boys, Christina became an advocate for a change in child care and practical support for single-mother families. She was elected to the Whyalla City Council on a childcare platform and in 1982 ran as a Labor candidate for the South Australian state election. While she did not win the seat, newly elected Premier John Bannon thanked her personally for her mettle and integrity in an extremely tough campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1983, Christina moved her family to Alice Springs. This was her second time in Alice Springs, and it didn't take long to become an integral member of the Labor branch in the Northern Territory, campaigning on behalf of candidates in both the Northern Territory and federal elections. During her time in Alice Springs, she travelled throughout the Red Centre, first as an educator and then, later, as a Centrelink officer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Christina valued her time with Aboriginal people from remote communities and saw education as vital for self-determination, development and independence. Throughout her life, Christina was a staunch social justice advocate and a true visionary for the Labor cause. Warren Snowdon, the former member for Lingiari, put it succinctly when he said, 'Christina was a friend to many and in every sense a true believer.' She was a vocal conference delegate and an active participant in debate, political activities and so much more. As Warren noted, Christina's wonderful legacy will be fondly remembered by many of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to leave the House with the following Bible passage from 2 Timothy 4:7, which so beautifully captures the life of Christina Lillian Phillis:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="124514" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  Last week I visited Rosebud Hospital with Felicity Topp, CEO of Peninsula Health, who steps down from this role on Friday, after six years. We wish her all the best; she has been a remarkable leader for our community. On my tour, we were joined by Karly Hudgson, nurse manager; and Sue Gilbert, strident community advocate for the rebuild of the hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rosebud Hospital sits on Point Nepean Road at what was once the spot of David Cairns's home, Eleanora, a building made of local limestone, which he gifted along with nine acres of land to Melbourne's Alfred Hospital back in 1935. Originally it provided respite for the hospital's metropolitan doctors and nurses, and the current hospital was built there in 1961. Today that hospital is quite elaborate, aged in parts and refurbished in others, with the last additions made 25 years ago. What the hospital lacks in structural excellence however, it makes up for in nurse and patient engagement and enjoyment. The staff love working there, and the patients love being cared for there. The hospital can hold 60 patients, with eight emergency beds. On the day I was there, as it is every day, the hospital was full to the brim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why most patients now, and certainly critical ones, bypass Rosebud Hospital and go straight to Frankston Hospital, which is 45 minutes away and, in the peak of summer, up to two hours way. Five years ago, a master plan funded by the Commonwealth was designed to rebuild Rosebud Hospital and bring it up to 160 beds. Fit-for-purpose buildings and equipment would hopefully have brought back surgery and maternity services to our local area. At the last state election the Andrews-Allan government promised hundreds of millions of dollars for regional hospitals, including $675 million for a new hospital in West Gippsland and $290 million to redevelop and expand the Wonthaggi Hospital. But, when it came to the Mornington Peninsula, there was nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My friend Sam Groth, now the member for Nepean, promised a future coalition government would provide $340 million rebuild the hospital, a promise never matched by the ALP. A local petition that we sponsored together garnered 3,500 signatures, and it now sits with the Victorian parliament—unaddressed. In the absence of action by the Andrews-Allan government, local fundraising has been required to secure upgraded equipment like new beds and wheelchairs. The hospital has been generously supported by the local community, including the Australian Legion of Ex-Servicemen and Women Southern Peninsula Sub-Branch, the Victoria Police Blue Ribbon Foundation and the Rosebud Yacht Club. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the Albanese government ripped $300 million worth of infrastructure funding out of the Mornington Peninsula, and at the time I pleaded with both the infrastructure minister and the health minister to direct some of that money to the Rosebud Hospital. Yet there remains no action on the part of this government or the state Labor government. No minister has come to visit; there are no peeps about future plans—just incompetent silence. The Mornington Peninsula deserves better. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  Australia is overwhelmingly a peaceful and collegiate nation. For millennia, we have been a multicultural nation. Overwhelmingly positive for our country, multiculturalism has improved our communities in Australia, and I see this every day in Werriwa. So many diverse communities come together to raise money for those less fortunate, helping in times of disaster and supporting themselves and each other. But, in embracing multiculturalism, we need to be sensitive and attentive to the concerns of our citizens. There's no space now or ever to disrespect people because of their ethnicity, religious practices or what they believe in. Our diversity is our greatest strength, and we all prosper by embracing this. Our communities in south-west Sydney are a prime example of this action. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I had the opportunity to host and more importantly recognise volunteers in Werriwa. This was the eighth occasion I've done this, and it showcases the very best of our community and our society. Each of the people recognised on the day have done wonderful things, not expecting recognition, often over many decades and in all areas of our lives. Often we assume these are paid roles, but they're not—they're volunteers. Whether they're a JP signing a statutory declaration or a referee at a kids football game, they dedicate their time for the betterment of our community, which is why they deserve to be recognised every single day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say congratulations and thank you to the 2024 Werriwa volunteer awardees: Antoinette Sulfaro and Grace Newcombe from Ladies Like to Lunch; Amy Lee Eldridge from the PCYC Liverpool; Quyen McGlone from St Anthony of Padua Catholic College; Sue Alcock from Liverpool Quota; George Wilson from the NSW Justices Association; Rajani Nayak, Mayasandra Sridhar, Ranganath Rao and Shivappa Muniyappa from Friends of India; Dee Martin from Middleton Grange Public School; William Dickson from Whiddon Glenfield; Dianne Young and Mathew Hay from Meals on Wheels; and Gautham Rao, Srikumar Ravikumar, Prakash Koovekal and Jyothi Angadi from Sewa. Sewa organise support for flood victims in Lismore, and others have provided JP services in our community for over 50 years. Some have delivered meals for those who can't do it anymore or raised money to support cancer victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the privilege of attending the national volunteer Whiddon lunch to mark National Volunteer Week. It was wonderful to be at this aged-care facility and congratulate them on all they do to find interesting things for their residents. Thank you to everyone in our community who volunteers every day, and congratulations to those who've been recognised this year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  I wish to name the members of the Qantas board because this is a name and a shame: Richard Goyder AO, Maxine Brenner, Jacqueline Hey, Belinda Hutchinson AC, Michael L'Estrange AO, Doug Parker, Todd Sampson, Dr Heather Smith PSM, Antony Tyler et cetera. Whatever Qantas once was, it is now the complete opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragedy is that many of the people that have been working with them are people that are still dedicated to the founding aspirations of Qantas. It was founded to shrink the tyranny of distance, and I speak with that knowledge because my grandfather was part of not the original but the second group of investors. There were three Katter boys—my father and his two brothers—and two of the three Katter boys died as a result of the tyranny of distance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, let me list of their actions. They had workers sleeping on concrete with blankets at airport baggage handling terminals—that was on national television three times—and they did nothing. They sent 1,500 aeroengineers, the mechanics that fix your aeroplanes, offshore. They sacked 1,500 Australians, and the ramifications for safety are serious. They've outsourced their cleaning and maintenance services to companies employing low-paid foreign workers. They jack up the price of airfares to regional and remote locations to subsidise their international locations. It's $609 to fly from Dubai to London, where there's competition. It's $1,446 from Mount Isa to Cairns, where there is no competition. They sacked 2,000 workers during COVID while taking government support payments worth 2½ thousand million dollars. These people brought out a magazine, and the CEO indulged his own sexual proclivities on two pages of that magazine. What would happen if someone here used a magazine of the parliament to promote their own personal sexual proclivities, whatever they may be?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But those, my friends, are just some of the sins of the Qantas board. Don't keep blaming this dreadful creature, the most hated man in Australia. You approved every single one of those decisions. If there were a corporation that should be shamed by the people of Australia, it is the Qantas board, not the people who work for Qantas. As for saying we all know whatever tribe when they land, in North Queensland 15 per cent are First Australians, but not one single First Australian is employed by Qantas in North Queensland. For an exercise in hypocrisy, that'd take some beating!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  For those of us who came into this place wanting to address climate change and wanting to move off fossil fuels as quickly as possible and ensure we live in a more sustainable country, the last few weeks in this political debate have been thoroughly dispiriting. We have seen a return of the climate wars, which first got kicked off by the Leader of the Opposition, who decided that they would not set an emissions reduction target by 2030, potentially meaning that we will pull out of the Paris Agreement. It escalated last week when we finally found out about their nuclear energy plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to steal a line here from Emeritus Professor Ian Lowe, who describes their nuclear energy plan as being 'legally impossible, technically improbable, economically irrational and environmentally irresponsible'. That line there best describes what we have been handed by the coalition when it comes to their nuclear energy policy. There are significant legal hurdles that we would need to clear. It is technically difficult given there isn't a nuclear energy industry in this country at the moment. It is economically irrational because it would be totally funded by the government because there will be no private investment in nuclear energy because they know that it is the most expensive form of energy. It is environmentally irresponsible because it pushes action on climate change to decades and decades down the track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An antidote to this terrible policy and the return of the climate wars for me was to go to the smart energy expo, organised by a group of committed locals, the Climate Action Burwood Canada Bay group. They are led by Ken Enderby, Robin Smith, Rick Eyre and Steven Du. They organised this fantastic expo at MLC School in Burwood to provide local residents practical advice on how they can electrify their home and about electric vehicles. People got to go for test drives in electric vehicles. They talked to home energy exports about installing heat pumps and solar panels as well as to doctors about the health impacts of gas. I want to thank all the organisations that were there: the Climate Energy Finance Corporation, Rewiring Australia, Solar Citizens, Doctors for the Environment and a great organisation called ZapCat, a social enterprise trying to make it easier for people to electrify their homes. Also present was Asian Australians for Climate Solutions, who were there using induction cookers to make delicious dumplings.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LLEW O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to Keith Barry Michael Ryder, who passed away on 4 April, aged 85. Keith was born in Brisbane in February 1939 to Beryl and Keith Ryder Sr. He had a modest upbringing, sharing his childhood with his younger brother, Paul. While at high school, Keith developed skills in shorthand that laid the foundation for a future career. In 1965, Keith married Noelene, a country girl from Gympie. They settled in Brisbane, where Keith began his Queensland court reporting bureau career, honing his shorthand and reporting skills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1967, Keith and Noelene shifted to Canberra and he commenced work at Parliament House as a reporter with Commonwealth Hansard. He climbed the ladder to a managerial position, and during this time he would also work as a reporter in the Queensland, New South Wales, Victorian and Solomon Islands parliaments. He also worked in all parliamentary buildings in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Upon his retirement in 1994, Keith worked at the ACT Legislative Assembly, during which time he introduced several reforms to modernise the production of the assembly <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. Keith worked casually, full time and then casually again before finally retiring at age 83.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Keith and Noelene were blessed with two children, Samantha and Joshua. He was never shy about expressing his love and pride for his family. Keith was a doting grandfather to Zac, Kade, Maeve and Amber. Keith and Noelene were married for 59 years at the time of his passing, and that's a testament to their enduring love and commitment to their family. Keith was a spritely 85-year-old. However, he had a few health issues. Twenty years ago, he had a triple bypass and then bowel, liver and, more recently, prostate cancer—all of which he overcame. While there were many things that tried to take him out slowly, it was ultimately a stroke that sent him on his way while watching the Raiders lead the Sharks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first met Keith in 1989 as a newly in love, very nervous 17-year-old meeting the extended family of my now wife. Keith was a wise, very gentle man with a big heart. Keith was at my maiden speech when I made it in 2016, and that was a very special moment for me, as he saw the development of my life from being that 17-year-old kid to where I am today. My condolences go to Noelene and the family. Rest in peace, Keith Barry Michael Ryder.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2024 federal budget invests in building a better and fairer education system for all Australians in early education and care, schools, TAFE and universities. Programs like the Schools Upgrade Fund are excellent examples of this federal investment. The Albanese Labor government is delivering on its promise to invest in our schools. I was pleased to see that Richardson Primary School and Isabella Plains Early Childhood School in Bean shared over $1 million in federal funding. Seven schools in the ACT will benefit from a share of $2.5 million in grants to build or upgrade infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding is part of the more than $250 million commitment to improve school infrastructure across the country. This fund provides more equitable access to resources to support schools to help keep students and school staff safe and get students' education back on track after disruptions caused by COVID-19. From upgrading classrooms to new outdoor equipment, this funding will deliver upgrades to public schools that need it the most and is another important step in building a better and fairer education system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I had the opportunity to visit Richardson Primary School and was shown how this funding will improve learning spaces by Deputy Principal Sally Alexander. I also joined Principal Simon Barker and toured where new outdoor play spaces will go at the Isabella Plains Early Childhood School.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public schools with the greatest need have been prioritised, including schools with higher numbers of students from a low socioeconomic background, First Nations students and students with disability. These school infrastructure upgrades are another great example of the ACT and Commonwealth government working collaboratively to deliver positive outcomes for Canberrans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is offering the biggest increase in federal funding to public schools that has ever been delivered. In addition to other announcements, the budget also included $4 million for the Together for Humanity program to expand their social cohesion programs into more schools. This will expand their reach into underrepresented jurisdictions and communities as well as increase activities aimed at addressing all forms of discrimination in schools—in particular, antisemitism and Islamophobia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is committed to working with states and territories to fully fund all schools across the country. The government is offering states and territories the largest investment in Australia's public education system ever delivered. The budget is a key step in building a better and fairer education system for every Australian, where more people will attend early education, finish school and go to TAFE or university.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="240756" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  The Berri and wider Riverland communities in South Australia are mourning the passing of a great South Australian, Malcolm Hill, who died late last month at the age of 85. Malcolm was born in Victoria in 1938 but moved to the Riverland in the early 1960s to run a fruit block, but Malcolm brought so much more to the region than just a blockie's toil and hard work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hawthorn Football Club supporters may remember Malcolm because, before he left Victoria, he played 22 games for that club, including as a member of their inaugural 1961 premiership side. That wasn't enough for Malcolm. In South Australia his sporting prowess continued to shine. He cemented himself as a star with the Berri Football Club. His reputation preceded him, so he was quickly sought out by legendary Sturt Football Club coach Jack Oatey. Jack convinced Malcolm to travel to Adelaide and to pull on the 'Double Blues' guernsey, and he continued to play locally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 1962 and 1969 Malcolm played periodically for Sturt. In fact, he played 62 SANFL games, three of those games as a member of the renowned Sturt premiership sides of 1966, 1968 and 1969. During this time he also won premierships as part of the 1966, 1967 and 1968 teams at the Berri Demons, taking out the award of club champion in 1966. The sporting success and acknowledgements continued. In 1975 Malcolm, as coach, took the team to a premiership. In 1977, having finished up as a club coach, Malcolm was honoured with a place in the Riverland Team of the Century and an inaugural place in the Berri Football Club Hall of Fame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His sporting skills have been passed on to his talented sporting family, including to his grandson Alexander, a champion rower and an Olympic gold and silver medallist who will represent Australia again in Paris shortly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Malcolm's accomplishments weren't confined to the sporting field. He was a well-known long-term manager of the Berri Hotel, steering the community hotel to become a major success story for the South Australian hospitality sector. In recognition of his business acumen he was awarded life membership of the Australian Hotels Association by the state council for that 17 years of service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A fierce advocate for the Riverland, particularly through the Riverland Grape Growers Association, Malcolm was admired for his knowledge of the Murray-Darling Basin. Never afraid to speak up and speak truth to power, he was a man of integrity and of conviction. But, above all, Malcolm was a family man, and a warm and convivial friend to many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to offer my condolences to his wife of 62 years, Ann; to his children, Peter, Amanda, Julia and their partners; and to his grandchildren and great grandchildren. Vale, Malcolm Hill.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  The Hunter Region Business Excellence Awards recognise outstanding achievements for businesses and individuals across the Hunter. Whether it's industrial trades, tourism, finances or personal services, it all comes back to our incredible community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Laxmi Nahar, of Morpeth Family Medical Practice, was awarded Business Woman of the Year. Laxmi and her husband, Dr Amrit Nahar, opened their practice in 2011 and have spent the last 13 years being tirelessly dedicated to their patients and providing excellent medical advice and education. As of today, Laxmi and her husband have more than 6,000 patients on the books and five doctors employed. It's people like Laxmi who make our community strong and connected. She empowers women, our senior citizens, survivors of domestic violence and young people looking for medical advice, often at very sensitive and tender times. She inspires people to be stronger, safer and better aware of their own health. They know that they'll always be heard and understood at Morpeth Family Medical Practice. I'd like to offer a heartfelt congratulations to Dr Nahar. I congratulate her on her reward and thank her for everything she has done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside Dr Nahar, the Mai-Wel Group, which is an institution in Maitland, was awarded the Not-For-Profit Business of the Year Award for the work that they do with our people with disabilities. They do incredible work. I'm so proud to think that they achieved that. Chisholm based business Get Fit For Life was awarded the Health Services Business of the Year Award. Isn't that a message for us all—to get fit for life? Rutherford's RAS Training and Services won the Trades and Industry Business of the Year Award, which, in such a trade-heavy area, is no mean feat at all. Congratulations, RAS Training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to take a moment to congratulate those in my electorate who received King's birthday honours. They are: Sharon Pope, who lives in Lochinvar, for her outstanding work in urban and regional planning; Ruth Wilson, who is an incredible hot air balloon pilot. At the age of 79, Ruth was flying over the Swiss Alps at 15,000 feet in the night. I can't wait to read her book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Conquering Clouds</span>. Congratulations. Finally, Flight Lieutenant Jack Devine was awarded the outstanding achievement as Staff Officer Grade 3, for his work at headquarters No. 42nd wing. Congratulations to you all.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion calls on the government to tax the big corporations and millionaires so that we can make dental and mental health care free under Medicare. As the cost-of-living crisis bites, more and more Australians simply cannot afford a large dental bill or access to mental health services. You shouldn't have to choose between paying the rent and seeing the dentist or a therapist. Forty per cent of Australians are avoiding the dentist due to cost, and thousands of children are being hospitalised each year for preventable oral problems.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, people are rationing therapy sessions to spread out the 10 subsidised sessions—cut down from 20 per year by the Labor government—over the year. A quarter of people who need mental health support are delaying or just not seeing a psychologist due to cost. That's hundreds of thousands of Australians suffering for no other reason than our heartless government.</span>

                  </a>  This is nonsense. The government can afford it. Everyday people can't. We're paying hundreds a year just for teeth check-ups and hundreds more if something needs fixing. For those needing frequent psychological visits, you'll be thousands out of pocket. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These same major parties are on a unity ticket to spend hundreds of billions on nuclear submarines, tens of billions of fossil fuel subsidies that make the climate crisis worse and tens of billions in investor subsidies that make the housing crisis worse. It shouldn't be this hard to make the health of Australians a priority. It's a no-brainer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 40 per cent of Australians aged between 16 and 24 experienced a mental disorder in the last 12 months. Young people are suffering the most from this cost-of-living crisis, but Labor is abandoning young people who need mental health help. They cut subsidised mental health sessions from 20 to 10 per year. This is just the subsidy we're talking about. It doesn't even cover the full cost. They also make you jump through extra hoops to get the last four sessions of the ten—you need another referral from a GP, which will cost you unless you're lucky enough to be bulk-billed, which is getting rarer and rarer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The narrative that mental health is not the government's responsibility is so purposely ingrained that it's considered completely normal that government agencies routinely just tell people to contact Lifeline if they're in distress or in crisis—Lifeline is a charity reliant on volunteers that is already completely overwhelmed and unable to help everyone who calls. Just bring mental health into Medicare and make it free for everyone. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare is broken in Australia. We do not have a universal healthcare system. Mental and dental health are excluded from Medicare, and public hospitals are absolutely overwhelmed and underfunded. To top it all off, our amazing GPs on the front line cannot keep up. In my electorate of Ryan, it's pretty much impossible to find a GP who will and can bulk-bill. If you're lucky, you might pay $40 to cover the gap, but in many cases it's much higher than that. As a result, everyday Australians are forced to cover these giant holes in Medicare. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile gas corporations like Santos can get away with paying just $15,000 in tax on an income of $6 billion. Everyday people are having to make impossible choices between feeding their kids and seeing a doctor, but Santos are paying less income tax than most full-time workers in Australia. This broken system has serious consequences—consequences for people enduring long-term health problems because they couldn't afford to see a GP when first suspicious of a problem and consequences in our hospitals due to a lack of preventive health care. But Labor clearly prefer things getting materially worse for everyday people to taxing their corporate donors to pay for the health care of all Australians.</span>

As the member for Ryan well knows, Medicare is actually a great Labor accomplishment, and I will always defend and promote it and acknowledge the radical thinking of Whitlam a half-century ago and then the pragmatic efforts of Hawke to make this scheme a reality for all Australians now. The government recognises that many in our communities face significant barriers to accessing affordable dental services, but, as a sensible government, we have to make sure we get good policy right, and it must be economically sustainable. For some reason, the member for Ryan forgot to cost the policies she just spoke about, but I'm sure the member for Brisbane will go into the costing details when he speaks. Obviously if slogans, sound bites and memes were all it took to implement effective policies, our country would have no problems left to solve. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has committed to the long-term goal of incorporating dental health services into Medicare. Health Minister Butler and the state and territory health ministers have all prioritised dental health reform and finding reform options. While we've committed to expanding Medicare to dental health services, we are proactively investing in critical areas to support dental reform today. As part of last year's budget, the Albanese Labor government announced $1.7 million for a dental services costing study to determine an efficient price for public dental services. The results of this study will inform the future funding model. We also announced $400,000 for a new dental national minimum data set to collect nationally consistent activity and waiting times data. We have also contributed $215.6 million to assist states and territories to deliver dental health services for those experiencing crisis—and I've seen it at the QEII hospital in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal Labor governments always do the grunt work of delivering meaningful change for the Australian people. I've no doubt that, when we do expand Medicare to dental services, the Greens political party will try to claim credit for the work of Labor. I saw them try to co-opt Whitlam and Hawke, as soon as they died, to their brand. I remember that. It was disgraceful. This is what the Greens political party do nowadays. They are the party of passing off. Some might call it stealing or plagiarism. For example, Labor commissioned the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universities Accord </span>report back in November of 2022 as part of our commitment to higher education reform. Again, the Greens political party jumped on the Labor bandwagon and claimed our homework as their own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion from the member for Ryan—which isn't that important, obviously, because she left the chamber after introducing it—also references mental health services. Sadly, the issues facing the mental health sector do reflect the broader issues in our under-pressure health system, a system that Labor is working to repair, to address. Our recent budget allocated $361 million over the next four years to expand the range of free mental health services, ensuring that Australians who need help get help. The government is providing free mental health services, including psychiatry, psychology and GPs—an important frontline service—through a series of walk-in Medicare mental health centres and bulk-billing support across the country. We have also invested in Primary Health Networks and general practices to fund mental health nurses and other allied health professionals who can provide more specialised care for patients with complex needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a strong record when it comes to dental and mental health services. I particularly note our Strengthening Medicare reforms, which have seen billions of dollars in new investment, and bulk-billing rates rising, after years of neglect. Our budget committed to the rollout of 58 Medicare urgent care clinics in 2023, to relieve pressure on the health system, and this year we've committed to another 29, right across Australia. We've tripled the bulk-billing incentive. We've frozen the cost of PBS medicines, ensuring that every senior will pay, at most, $7.70 for the medicines they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In politics, there are show ponies and there are work horses. While Labor gets on with the job of delivering progressive and significant change for the Australian people, the show ponies will run around shouting out their slogans. They'll blockade electoral offices, causing havoc to NDIS people that live in my electorate. They'll chant their slogans out the front of my office. But one-trick ponies are no fun to ride at all. I'll always back the Labor work horses when it comes to looking after the Australian people and our healthcare system.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300246" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BATES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  Before I was elected to this place, I was working a retail job and one day noticed that I had a pretty bad toothache. Already, I was nervous about going to the dentist because of the cost. Even with private health insurance, a trip to the dentist can set you back a lot of money. I went, and was told I needed two fillings. Not ideal, but manageable. I knew there would be a decent price tag associated with the fillings, so I needed some time to save up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Flash forward a couple of months, and I was elected to this place. I got my first pay and immediately went straight back to the dentist. But I was too late. What had been fillings were now root canals, at a cost of thousands of dollars per tooth. The other option to me was to have these teeth pulled out. I remember sitting in the dentist's chair for a solid minute, contemplating this decision. My income was about to determine whether or not I got to keep my teeth in my head. If I had not been in a position then to afford the root canals, I would have had to either borrow money from my family or lose these teeth altogether.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know I'm not alone in this. So many people are having to put off going to the dentist because they just can't afford it. This often results in dental problems getting worse and more expensive. We are talking about access to basic health care, and Australians are being let down by a government that won't do anything to fix the problem. There's hundreds of billions of dollars for nuclear submarines, but when it comes time for grand visions of public health and improving peoples' lives we are always told that it would just cost too much. Everyone should be able to use their Medicare card when they go to the dentist, just like when they go to the doctor. There is absolutely no reason why health care should stop at your teeth. It is time we put dental into Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Accessing mental health care in this country is too expensive and too slow. Prevention and early intervention are key pillars of a strong mental health system, and we need to be doing more to help people before their mental health deteriorates and before they reach crisis point. Everyone deserves to have access to good mental health support. Unfortunately, our system makes it harder for low-income individuals to receive proper care. We cannot go down the path of the United States, and put being healthy behind a paywall. This doesn't give people an equal chance at a healthy life. With mental healthcare costs becoming more and more unaffordable, we are increasingly becoming a society where only those who have enough money can access mental health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Countries with universal healthcare systems have healthier citizens. When community members are healthy, there is a higher likelihood that people will be happier, jobs will be done better and our communities will thrive. Simply put, a truly universal healthcare system makes our communities better off. Prevention and early intervention can also prevent higher costs down the line. When individuals living with mental illness cannot afford to access the health care they need, people will hit a crisis point and present to emergency departments in hospitals instead. We know that preventive healthcare costs our health system less in the long run and reduces patients' risk. Getting people access to preventive health care when, or before, they need it is not just good for individuals but good for society and good for our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the rising costs of living, the housing crisis and climate anxiety, Australians need mental health support more than ever, and they need a government that will address the root causes of the surging need for mental health support. What that looks like is getting dental and mental health into Medicare; putting caps on rent increases; a huge build of public, affordable homes; no new coal and gas; lifting income support above the poverty line; and wiping all student debt. This is what will alleviate the financial strains causing surging mental health issues. Until the government wants to do any of that, the least it can do is to bring dental and mental health fully into Medicare.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  Access to dental care is critically important for people's health. Our government acknowledges that there are barriers to accessing affordable dental services, and we are committed to the long-term goal of expanding Medicare to dental health services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to begin with a story from very early in my political career—in fact, from when I was running for preselection here in Canberra. When I was calling around Labor members to talk to them about supporting me, I spoke to a woman who had noticed that I had said that expanding public dental care was one of the things I cared about. She had got to a point where her teeth were so bad—and she couldn't afford to get them fixed—that it meant that she didn't leave her house. She was an active Labor Party member who wouldn't even come to the forums or to cast her vote in person for that preselection, for that reason. It was absolutely heartbreaking that someone in our community would come to that point because of their inability to pay for health care. We talked a bit about the issue, and she said she was aware, of course, that there was funding for children to access dental care publicly. She said: 'I understand how important this is. As a single mother of four now-adult children, I understand why it is really important to help children to get dental care.' It really struck me that this woman had given so much, not just to her own family but to our society, in raising four children, and yet we, as a community, couldn't guarantee her a standard of health care that meant that she could continue to participate in her community. We can do much better than this. And that story will always stay with me. It is incredibly important that we do expand public access to dental care. As I said, this is something that our government is committed to in the long term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the work of dentist Dr Buuloc Lam in my electorate, who was recently awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in recognition of her humanitarian dental work internationally and in local charities in our community. Dr Lam runs a dental surgery in Braddon and, over the past 10 years, has regularly travelled to rural Vietnam and Nepal to provide humanitarian dental services. In just a single day during a trip to Vietnam in November 2019, Dr Lam and her colleague provided dental examinations for 68 children at a school. During the COVID pandemic, when Dr Lam could not travel overseas, she began providing dental care and funding support to Karinya House for mothers and babies in Canberra, Companion House and Sanjiwani Australia. Dr Lam's work has made a difference to so many lives here in our community. I want to congratulate her again on that really important humanitarian work that she does, which shows just how important this access is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Health ministers have made dental policy reform a priority and are considering funding reform options. In the 2023 budget, the government announced $2.1 million over two years for immediate developmental work to underpin long-term reform of funding for adult public dental services, and this work is ongoing. Our government is also continuing to work with state and territory colleagues to improve dental care for all Australians. In the 2023-24 budget, the government announced funding of $215.6 million over two years to support states and territories in delivering these services. Additionally, the government funds the provision of basic dental services for children from low-income families aged up to 17 years, through the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. Since its commencement in 2014, the CDBS has provided $3.1 billion in benefits and delivered $51 million worth of services to 3.5 million Australian children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is strengthening Medicare with more Medicare urgent care clinics, more free mental health services, higher Medicare rebates for many common medical tests and over $160 million for a women's health package. In this budget, we have built on the previous budget's record investment with a further $2.8 billion to strengthen Medicare, with more Medicare urgent care clinics, more free mental health services and a recent investment over four years to expand the range of free mental health services so that Australians get the right level of care for their level of need. Labor is the party of Medicare, and we are the party that is going to be there for people who need government support the most. That is an incredibly important thing that we must never lose sight of.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak to this motion moved in my name. I'm very proud to be part of an Albanese Labor government that takes climate change and energy security seriously. We remain steadfastly committed to delivering the clean, cheap, reliable and resilient renewable energy that Australians want and deserve as we undergo the transformation to net zero by 2050. We took this commitment to the Australian people, who gave us the mandate to implement our plan in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In just over two years, the Albanese Labor government has made massive progress on our reliable renewables plan, with now a 25 per cent increase of renewable energy into our grid. Through our government's expanded Capacity Investment Scheme, renewable generation and storage capacity will increase to 32 gigawatts by 2050. The scheme, designed to encourage new investment in renewable growth industries, such as wind, solar and battery storage, will bring more jobs and investment into carbon-intensive regions like Newcastle and the Hunter as well as ensuring cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy to Australian homes and businesses now and into the future. The government's $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia package will help Australia become a renewable energy superpower and deliver good jobs for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Newcastle and the Hunter have helped power Australian households and industries for generations, and it is regions like mine that will continue to do so for generations to come. Newcastle has the world-class infrastructure, deepwater port, highly-skilled workforce, abundant resources and energy smarts to be a lead in the transformation to renewables. That's why Labor is making targeted investments into Newcastle. We've invested $70 million in Origin to help develop a Hunter hydrogen hub in collaboration with Orica. Two out of the six national projects shortlisted for the $4 billion Hydrogen Headstart program are based in Newcastle. Last week, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy was in Newcastle to announce that a feasibility licence had been given to Novocastrian Wind, a joint project between Equinor and Oceanex which is the next step in building a new offshore wind industry in Australia. If approved, the Novocastrian wind farm will create 3,120 construction jobs and another 1,560 ongoing operational jobs in Newcastle and the Hunter.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">North-west of Newcastle, plans are underway to manufacture world-leading solar cells at the old Liddell coal-fired power station. The solar project will employ hundreds of people, more than were ever actually employed when the power station was in fact operational. At the Port of Newcastle, construction has started on a new low-carbon manufacturing plant that will, in partnership with an amazing local manufacturer, MCi Carbon, transform more than 1,000 tonnes of CO2 per annum and provide decarbonisation pathways for hard-to-abate sectors, including steel, cement, mining, chemicals and manufacturing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're training our future workforce to ensure we have a future made in Newcastle by investing 600,000 fee-free TAFE places, providing $10,000 to support new energy apprentices over the course of their apprenticeship and investing $16 million at the University of Newcastle new energy skills hub.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In stark contrast to Labor's track record, the same people who told us that we didn't need to worry about climate change for the last 10 years are now telling us that the answer to climate change is nuclear. They didn't do anything about that when they had the chance. The Australian people are right to call out this nuclear nonsense as being nothing more than a desperate attempt to distract us from renewables. This is reckless policymaking at its worst. Nuclear energy is wrong for Australia. It is too expensive, too slow to keep the lights on and far too risky. Indeed, CSIRO's <span style="font-style:italic;">GenCost</span> calculations found that nuclear is not economically competitive with renewables and will take at least 15 years to build. It is not the government saying this; these are the findings of the independent and much-respected CSIRO. They go on to note that the long development times mean that nuclear won't be able to make a significant contribution to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much to be said about taking notice of science based evidence in Australia. I would say that there is much that we don't know about the opposition's plans, and the Australian people have every right to ask questions. What I do know is that every scientist and expert is backing Labor's renewable reliable plan.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  Let's get one thing clear: climate change is not a football match, where we have the luxury of barracking for one side or the other. It's a fact, or rather a set of facts, and managing it is not optional or something to be kicked down the road. Climate change is already affecting us all. Concern about it and the lack of cohesive policy to mitigate it and prepare for it were big factors in the outcome of the 2022 election. This goes directly to the current debate that we're having about renewable energy and carbon reduction targets and the need for calm, consistent policymaking on these matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in rural and regional Australia are on the front line of climate change. Storms of greater frequency, fires of greater intensity, repeating floods, escalating insurance costs—all these things are having a shocking impact on Australians who live outside major cities. This is of great concern to those who live in both urban and rural Australia, because we're in this together. This affects our economy, this affects our community, this affects our people. I note that the coalition is confecting a city-country divide where none exists, not for our collective future but for what they believe is their survival. Meanwhile, Victoria's south-west coast received the lowest rainfall on record in the nine months to May. Western Victoria overall experienced record dry conditions between February and May this year. Farmers report the driest conditions in decades, with ewes deserting their offspring and lambs starving. This is where the focus should be, not on political pointscoring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who grew up in regional Australia and who later lived and worked in regional Australia, including covering fires and floods as a journalist, I'm not going to allow the coalition to run around unchecked creating a city-country divide to save their political skins. I note that during the last sitting the member for Indi moved more than a dozen amendments to support regional communities under the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill. These amendments were supported by the crossbench but not by the National Party or the Liberal Party. Enough of the phony outrage designed to divide and delay rather than fix it faster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Predictions are that in Bayside, Melbourne, which I represent, parts of waterfront suburbs will be under water in the future due to climate-change-related sea-level rise. Serious coastal erosion around Port Phillip Bay is already a major problem that local councils are grappling with, frustrated with the lack of cohesion between the various levels of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not State of Origin. This is not mate against mate. We're all in this together—not that the government should be smug about its record. Many members of the Goldstein community can't see much difference between Scott Morrison's so-called gas led recovery and this government's Future Gas Strategy, which sees the Commonwealth subsidising fossil fuel giants out to 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, we should be earmarking gas for domestic consumption at a price reflecting the fact that it's a resource for all Australians, and appropriately taxing export profits to fund the renewable energy transition. How ridiculous that there is talk of winter gas shortages when 80 per cent of our gas goes overseas and when those that we export it to, Japan specifically, are apparently re-exporting it to others, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. The indications are also that we will struggle to achieve the government's target of 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030, the key to getting to a 43 per cent reduction in carbon emissions as promised by Labor at the election and legislated shortly after coming to office. This will not be helped by either new fossil fuel projects approved by Labor or flip-flopping on renewables by the coalition as it goes nuclear but provides no detail on cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I'm not an ideological opponent of nuclear, but my questions are these: How much will it cost to build and run? Isn't it the case that the energy will be more expensive? What's the realistic timeframe? What's the business case for doing it when, unlike most countries, we have abundant cheaper alternatives? 'Trust me,' the opposition says with no costings; no estimates on how much power nuclear would supply, how much more gas would be required to underpin this and how much water would be needed to run the reactors; little community warning on consultation; where the waste will go—and on and on go the unanswered questions. As Dennis Denuto put it in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Castle</span>, the Leader of the Opposition wants us to believe in the vibe, but this is real, not a movie. Stack up the evidence or get on with the transition. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It was good to see the coalition finally acknowledge that nuclear is so profoundly uncommercial and uninsurable that the only way any reactor would ever be built in Australia would be through an eye-watering Sydney-Harbour-scale waste of taxpayer money. We still don't know how much they would cost to build, when they might be operational, how much energy they would deliver, which country and company would build them, what the price of energy would be and for how long guaranteed offtake agreements would run. There was also a lot of confusion about how the consultation would work and whether that would be genuine consultation in any meaningful sense.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to note that the shadow minister for energy, when he chaired an inquiry into nuclear power generation into 2019, chose as the title for his inquiry report <span style="font-style:italic;">Not without your approval: a way forward for nuclear technology in Australia</span>. Now it sounds like he's shifted to a different title altogether: more like 'You will get nuclear when we tell you to get nuclear'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to see how much credit the Leader of the Opposition is getting from some commentators for being brave enough to make a paper-thin announcement with no detail, based on a proposition that can fairly be described as deeply unintelligent.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a minute to give people at home a sense of the global reality when it comes to the comparison of nuclear to renewables. In 2022 there was US$495 billion invested in non-hydro renewables. That was a 35 per cent increase from the previous year and represented 74 per cent of all new generation investment. In the same year, the nuclear spend was only US$35 billion. That's barely seven per cent of the spend on renewables. In 2022 the world added 348 gigawatts of renewable energy and only four gigawatts of nuclear. Last year, 2023, the world added 440 gigawatts of renewables, a 26 per cent jump on the previous year. Meanwhile, net nuclear energy capacity globally actually decreased by one gigawatt. Last year, China alone added 217 gigawatts of renewables and only one gigawatt of nuclear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's compare a nuclear reactor to a hydro storage project with similar dispatchable power capacity. The British nuclear reactor Hinkley Point C, being built by the French company EDF, which was renationalised last year on the brink of bankruptcy, is already hugely delayed and has already experienced a massive cost blowout. The site was selected in 2010. Currently, it's predicted to commence operation in 2031. That is 21 years from go to woah for a country that has operated nuclear for a long time. At present, it will cost $90 billion for three gigawatts of energy, and it depends on a 35-year offtake agreement under which the British government guarantees to buy all the electricity produced at an indexed price that's already considerably more than what they pay for wind energy from the North Sea. On the other side of the equation, you have Snowy 2.0, a hydro storage project for firming renewable energy, commissioned by the Turnbull government. At present, it will cost $12 billion and dispatch two gigawatts of energy, with a much shorter timeframe from announcement to delivery and no long-term waste legacy issues and costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former is the very definition of a multidecade economic disaster, for which the British will continue to depend upon the French. The latter is an example of the cost-effective transition we're making to an affordable and substantially Australian-made clean energy independence. The latter is the kind of outcome you get from the sensible and responsible, fully costed, fully detailed, adult national energy policy of the Albanese government. What you would get from the coalition would be a massive blow to Australia as an investment destination and as a trusted regional global partner, through their decision to trash the Paris climate agreement while at the same time putting Australia in hock for generations by wasting hundreds of billions of dollars on a 70-year-old technology that is in decline globally and for which we will always be dependent on another government. Let's have that debate, by all means.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  The Albanese Labor government's motion talks about cheaper energy. Clearly, every member opposite advocating for this motion has forgotten their commitment at the last election to reduce power bills for Australians by $275. The default market offer released recently demonstrated that Western Sydney residents needed the reference price to drop by $1,000 to reach the Albanese Labor government's target of $275 less on power bills by 2025, from 2022 prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses facing the crunch in this energy affordability crisis will continue to struggle, regardless of a $325 hit from the government next financial year. There is a gym in Penrith, in my electorate in Western Sydney, with energy costs that have more than doubled, from $13,000 to $27½ thousand. A local manufacturer in Emu Plains said their energy bills have gone up 100 per cent. A defence manufacturing contractor in Jamisontown recently told me that they are struggling to stay open. How are small and family businesses and medium-sized enterprises across Western Sydney and, of course, all across Australia meant to survive under such financial burdens?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen a mass closure of manufacturers under the Albanese Labor government's watch, since May 2022. This harms local jobs. Western Sydney is crying out for more opportunities for locals to work across our community. We cannot afford to lose such important jobs for those with skills in manufacturing. They are desperately needed. And let's not forget the need for more gas supply in the domestic market. Almost half of manufacturers that use heating processes need natural gas. We need more gas approvals to ensure our sovereign capability is not at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote an op-ed for the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Daily Telegraph</span> last week in which I said that many manufacturers need 24/7 power, particularly in the form of gas, to ensure they can keep producing steel, aluminium and plastic products. These are the manufacturers in Western Sydney—heavy-industry manufacturers that create local jobs. The Albanese Labor government does not get this. I walk the floors of these manufacturers, and they simply can't put solar panels on their roofs and hope for the best. Gas is needed for them now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Climate Change and Energy has been busy fighting the ideological fight in his op-eds. Guess what. The coalition isn't putting ideology into the debate. Rather, we have a technology-agnostic approach to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 in a way that will ensure affordable and reliable power for all Australians. We have a minister who admitted that he didn't need to legislate his net zero target but chose to for investment purposes. Well, let's lift the ban on nuclear for civil industry in this country to see what investment can take place. But I know that neither the minister nor the rest of those opposite will want to do this. This is despite all G20 countries except Australia using nuclear energy. Why is it good for other major economies across the world but not for Australia? Why is it okay for our submariners to be in nuclear powered submarines but not for nuclear to power industry and homes across Australia? They're all quiet on the other side when the coalition members mention this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a fact: nuclear will cost a lot less than the $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion figure for the renewables-only approach thanks to this Labor government. Labor's approach would require up to 58 million solar panels, 3,500 new industrial wind turbines and up to 28,000 kilometres of new transmission lines across Australia. There is no country in the world that relies on solar and wind alone in the way that Labor is proposing to. By contrast, there are 32 countries operating zero-emissions nuclear plants, and another 50 countries are looking to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is happy to continue having this debate with Labor and will continue talking to the Australian public about its realistic approach to energy policy to bring down power prices for everyday Australians when they are struggling so much in this cost-of-living crisis, to ensure 24/7 energy and to create a new long-lasting industry for this country. Everyone across Western Sydney wants this, and every Australian deserves it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  I thank the member for Newcastle for moving this important motion. It provides a valuable opportunity to recognise the significant steps our government is taking to provide cheaper, cleaner, reliable renewable energy as we undergo the transition to net zero emissions by 2050 and to 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030. This comes at the time of the coalition's disastrous, half-baked nuclear energy announcement. It was an announcement that left Australians in the dark. It was all bluster—no detail. It was a three-page media release, a trojan horse to enable more fossil fuels for longer while rejecting climate action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The details we have simply don't stack up. All we know is that there are several locations for reactors. But what about the massive cost of the scheme, the timeframe to build these risky reactors, the size and number of reactors and the safety of communities living nearby? My communities are already asking, 'How much will Dutton's nuclear thought bubble cost me and my family?' The coalition has no answer. They say they will let us know after the election. Well, that is just not good enough—not when it's about the health and preservation of our planet, the safety of communities and the environment, our global commitment to the Paris Agreement and the enormous cost it will impose on households if it even happens. It's chaos, because the opposition's plan is toxic and confusing and will cost a bomb.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the Leader of the Opposition, only a year ago, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what's changed? The fact is that we have an election coming and the coalition have no policies; this is the only thing they've got. Government is about more than thought bubbles. Unlike the coalition, the Albanese government has a solid plan that is costed; reduces emissions; drives down power bills; creates clean, green jobs; and protects our planet from the ravages of climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

The report by the CSIRO and AEMO found the cost of power for small modular nuclear reactors would be up to eight times more expensive than large-scale wind and solar. It also found nuclear would be too slow to keep the lights on, with <span style="font-style:italic;">Gen</span><span style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ost</span> confirming the first full operation would be no sooner than 2040—that's 26 years away at least—for small modular nuclear reactors and would be years later for large-scale nuclear reactors. The report also confirms the opposition's half-baked thought bubble is not a viable solution to meet energy shortages between now and 2040.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to implementation, there are more questions: How much nuclear waste will be produced? How much energy will be created? How much gas and coal will be needed in the energy mix, and how will this affect industry confidence in renewables investment, as well as jobs? And, finally, will the coalition override states and communities who say no to nuclear reactors? We do know that all eastern states have recently rejected the coalition's nuclear fantasy. They are backing renewables. The Albanese government is backing renewables because it makes absolute sense for energy security, for household energy bills, for our environment and for urgent action on climate change.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to government, we've approved more than 50 renewable energy projects. We've got more than three million Australian homes powered by renewables. We're supporting investment in 32 gigawatts of new renewable generation and storage across Australia through the Capacity Investment Scheme. We're delivering Australian homes and businesses cheaper, cleaner energy, and we're investing $22.7 billion in our Future Made in Australia package to drive our nation as a renewable energy superpower.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  I can't agree with the premise of this. We have to have a total reality check about the misinformation that's been peddled for 15 years about a renewable system being cheap. An individual renewable generator might be cheap, and it bloody well should be—I take that back. It really should be because it doesn't deliver much energy. The capacity factor of renewables is incredibly low. Would you build a car that only worked 15, 10 or five per cent of the time? No, you wouldn't. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the proponents on the other side are suggesting that we build up to 82 per cent renewables as the base for our electricity system. The full system cost of electricity under renewables is incredibly expensive because it firstly has to be overbuilt to try and, at least on paper, make up for the low-capacity factor. The University of Melbourne, the University of Queensland and Princeton uni have actually analysed this cost. It's called the Net-Zero Australia Study. It took all the highly trained academics and researchers two years, and their landmark report pointed out the cost that is needed by 2030 for the scheme. It's an absolute bargain! It's $1.3 to $1.5 trillion for a renewables-only system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A renewables system is justified by the LCOE metric, but the levelised cost of energy, which is in the GenCost report—the CSIRO badged report—is the cost of generation. The generators don't set your electricity price. The grid and the delivery of electricity set the price, and that's the levelised cost of energy for the full system. For a grid built on renewables, that is incredibly expensive. That's what Princeton uni, Melbourne uni and Queensland uni have published and put on the record with a straight face. That is what it's going to cost Australia. It also means carpeting the equivalent of the state of Victoria with solar farms and wind farms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear costs have been analysed by many bodies, including the United Nations, the EU, the OECD and Australian academics like the former Labor candidate for the seat of Goulburn—a good colleague of mine—Mr Robert Parker. A trained engineer who has a master's in nuclear science from ANU, he and Robert Barr, who runs Electric Power Consulting and came out of the New South Wales electricity commission, have actually done the cost, and a baseload system based on nuclear energy is the best solution both for the climate and the economy. Renewables based systems not only cost a fortune to build; they have a short lifespan, a huge geographic footprint and need massive backup with batteries. You need to expand the grid. A minimum of 10,000 kilometres is proposed at the moment, but if you really want to make hydrogen all over the country you will have to make about 23,000 kilometres. What it doesn't tell you is that, with this renewable system, your house, your battery and your car's battery are going to be the backups for a system that will inevitably fail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During May, wind generation in Australia did what wind generation always does around this time of year. We had some beautifully sunny days and weeks. You couldn't feel a breath of wind. The amount of generation in most of these wind farm areas was in the single figures on more days than not. That's why you need all these massive backups of batteries and pumped hydro schemes that are yet to be built. It is absolutely misleading when people say that a renewables based system is cheap. Renewables will have a place in any system, but you can't use it as the baseload. Baseload energy is the same as every other energy: it's got to be there with frequency control, with the right voltage, at the right place, and it has to be reliable. You can't have a system if it depends on the weather. You can't run a nation depending on the weather.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Newcastle's motion does another thing: it provides us with some evidence of her powers of clairvoyance, predicting that, 687 days after the Leader of the Opposition's nuclear thought bubble, they would go in front of the media and announce some of the details of that policy. That was last week. They rewarded us for our patience with a pamphlet masquerading as a policy. It is around 4½ pages of detail double line spaced, roughly 2,000 words shallow, after all this time. You can even smell the crayon coming right off the page. It's left many with more questions than answers—answers the opposition either are withholding from the Australian people or haven't bothered to come up with yet. They are Australia's most expensive improv troupe. I am not quite sure which of the two possibilities is less terrifying. It is a document that mentions Labor eight times in their centrepiece policy. But it is a real policy because it's printed on real paper, using real ink and real staples! It's more fizzer than fission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition may have launched this 4½-page pamphlet flanked by his colleagues the member for Maranoa, the member for Farrer, the member for Hume and the member for Fairfax, but, perhaps as a curious design choice, none of the above were pictured on the cover, deciding against Tony Abbott's pre-election pamphlet design back in 2013. I think even they know that, if they'd had the gang of five pictured, it would have been taken even less seriously, because everyone knows they have no business being involved in a credible energy policy, especially after the 22 policy failures they've seen collectively from their time in office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the amount of time they've had to work on this, you can't even call it policy on the run, but it is certainly policy underdone. When the CSIRO released their <span style="font-style:italic;">GenCost</span> report outlining the absurdity of introducing nuclear power into Australia's energy mix for its suitability, cost and timeliness, basically throwing those opposite a lifeline to say that they had heard the experts out and gone back to the drawing board, they just doubled down. They disputed the CSIRO's modelling and said that they knew better. What would scientists know anyway? Even if any number of the local communities around these proposed sites don't want a bar of their proposal, as Senator Davey rudely discovered last week, that won't matter either. Those opposite know better. What would they know?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have, however, pointed to internal polling saying that everyone living around the proposed nuclear sites loves the idea. Much like their modelling, their costings and, effectively, everything else that would collectively amount to being an actual policy, it is either not there or purposely hidden from view. They would have you believe that their policy would end up with nuclear power plants being built and running as soon as 2035 and that there won't be any delays or cost blowouts in the build phase. They would have you believe that somehow these would be built at a world-record speed, not even factoring in the cost blowouts when building a first-of-a-kind reactor in a country. I'm not sure which of those eight locations are going to be f-o-a-k-ed. If the community is not behind it, that's too bad. If the state government isn't behind it, that's too bad. If the owner of the site isn't behind it, that's too bad as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, we all know that this isn't just some fever dream of 'Plutonium Pete' to bring nuclear power to Australia. This is about white-anting renewables and the multibillion-dollar industry that surrounds them here in Australia. That is what they do best. They wasted the best part of 10 years, destabilising the renewable energy sector from government, and now they are throwing a great, big, nuclear dead cat on the table, in an attempt to do the same from opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia can't afford to lose more time when it comes to increasing our renewables capacity and rebuilding our renewables industry. Billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are being put at risk, because of the hubris of those opposite. Australia can't afford to lose out because of it. If you try to digest the magic pudding that is their nuclear energy policy, you'll see Australians will be picking up the tab and paying for this risky policy for decades.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a very tough time to be a young Australian right now. We're seeing that, as inflation bears down across the economy, it bears down in an uneven way. There are sections of our society who are carrying the weight more than others, and one of those is young Australians. Those aged between 21 and 29 are the only demographic in Australia to see both their discretionary and non-discretionary spending go backwards. We're seeing this at the time of a housing crisis, when house prices continue to rise and housing availability continues to fall. We're seeing these people faced with a future that is getting worse and worse. They can't afford to save a deposit for a house and, if they're lucky enough to get a loan from the bank of mum and dad, they can't afford to service a mortgage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time, in this context for this group of Australians, we're seeing this government reduce confidence in their super and reduce confidence in their retirement. No doubt, in the course of this debate, we will hear those opposite talk about superannuation as being a great Labor legacy. It is a legacy of the Hawke and Keating government—of old Labor. In that context, I want to speak to how different old Labor is to new Labor in their approach to superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's good to remember where superannuation comes from—to go back and to read what was happening when the prices and incomes accord was being made, way back in 1983. This was when we had a Labor prime minister willing—member for Bowman, get this—to stand up to the unions. It was extraordinary. Maybe that's what made all Australians get behind him and understand that he was there for the national interest. He was willing to stand up to the unions, who were demanding continued price rises in the inflationary period. The Prime Minister knew, as the RBA governor of today knows, that this increased government spending will drive inflation harder and make things worse. It's not just a comparison I make with the Prime Minister. Compare that to, unfortunately, the relationship we're seeing between, let's say, John Setka—just to pick a random union member—and the Prime Minister of today. There is no standing up to the unions under this Prime Minister. In fact, he's rolled over on every one of their demands, including the abolition of the ABCC, and given them free rein.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the Prime Minister. Let's compare the approach of the Treasurer of the day, who supported superannuation and who got it through—Paul Keating—to the Treasurer that we have now. Keating was the last Treasurer to reduce spending as a percentage of GDP for three budgets in a row. Compare that to our current Treasurer, who has increased spending as a percentage of GDP for three budgets in a row. The difference between old Labor and new Labor is apparent across our economy. We're feeling the pain of it now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They may speak to superannuation as a Labor legacy. It's an abandoned legacy. It's a legacy that they have walked away from, as new Labor needs to fight with the Greens to secure their inner-city seats. This is no longer a Labor that is being fiscally responsible. This is no longer a Labor that wants to reach out to young people who are struggling through an inflationary period, who are seeing the costs of everything go up and who are not yet in a period of their lives where they can save money and get onto that housing ladder. It's not giving them confidence in their retirement; it's the complete opposite. They've abandoned their legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So bad is this abandonment and so full is their new spending that they've had to invent a new tax. It's a tax on unrealised capital gains. There are two groups that have made very, very clear the impact on young people that these changes will have. The first is the National Farmers Federation. Their statement says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This may see the farmers left with a terrible choice. Sell the farm to meet these new tax obligations or increase their lease rates so much that their own children and grandchildren can't afford it and leave the industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a damning indictment of this government's approach to securing the future of Australians. The Financial Services Council said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Leaving the cap stuck at $3 million will mean that in today's dollars a 30-year-old will have a real cap of around $1 million, calling into question the intergenerational fairness of an unindexed cap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will hurt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put this in, once again maybe drawing some contrast between old Labor and new Labor in the context of today's fiscal situation. We have just seen a surplus brought forward at the expense of 10 years of deficits. Not only are you paying more for things now under Labor; you will pay more for things into the future as their policies play out and make things worse. The people who are going to hurt the most from this, of course, are those young Australians struggling to get through a very difficult period without the support of the government, who said that they would make things easier for them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  Deputy Speaker, if you needed any convincing that it's Monday, I think that contribution would be it. There wasn't really a lot on the motion. He said 'unions' about 50 times. He's clinically obsessed. They say 'Hawke and Keating' a lot, but it's really unclear what the rest of the point of that speech was. But I did see a media article about the member who moved the motion—thank you for bringing the debate. The media article said that he's one of the great hopes of the future of the Liberal Party, that he's one of the smarter ones and that really what they need to do is cut the deadwood away on the front bench and give that bloke, whatever his name was, a guernsey leading the team. Well, God help us if this motion is his best work. It's a word salad of utter nonsense. I mean, Member for whoever you were, do better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The core complaint in this motion—and it's interesting that he didn't actually address the core point of his own motion in his speech—is that the government is making a modest adjustment to superannuation tax breaks for earnings on balances over, wait for it, $3 million. That's right. All the screeching and shouting and hyperbole in the motion is to champion tax breaks for people with millions and millions—in some cases tens of millions—of dollars in their superannuation accounts. The fact is that 99.5 per cent of Australians will keep the same tax break that they have. The 0.5 per cent of Australians who have been lucky enough, worked hard enough—it's a bit of both; some of it is because they've worked hard enough; a lot of it is just inheritance tax avoidance, frankly, where mummy and daddy give you millions of dollars to put in the super account so you don't have to pay tax on it. But that 0.5 per cent with more than $3 million will still receive tax breaks, just slightly less generous ones. And there is no change to the amount that people can accumulate in super. So, for anyone at home who has got a sleeping disorder—I get a bit of insomnia myself—you could google the motion somewhere on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> and note the fact that the member didn't actually talk to the core complaint he's making, because it is ridiculous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give him full marks for comedy, though, for trying to dress up with 'concern for young Australians' his championing of a tax break for people with more than $3 million in their super accounts. The biggest risk to superannuation for young people, though—let's be very clear—is not a modest change to tax breaks for people with more than $3 million in their super account. No. It's what I've termed for a long time the gold medal for policy stupidity, which goes to those opposite. He mentioned it somewhere in the motion, near the end; I don't think he's really backing it in—but it's the super-for-housing policy. That's right. Their only housing policy is to allow young Australians to raid their superannuation and push up the cost of housing. That's why I gave it the gold medal for policy stupidity, because it's a double whammy: you trash your retirement savings and you enrich the people selling the house. Indeed, the modelling shows a $75,000 increase to the median house price if you let people unleash their superannuation savings in this way. Here's a tip for the bloke opposite who moved the motion: you don't make housing more affordable by making it more expensive. If you actually took their super-for-housing policy seriously—it's the kind of housing policy you have when you don't actually want a housing policy. It's a bit like the energy policy they announced last week, which was not a policy; it was a pamphlet with a cut-and-paste picture from the internet, with no costings. That's the kind of energy policy you have when you don't actually want to have an energy policy. So there's a bit of commonality here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is a difficult challenge now, because, until last week, super for housing was their only policy. The only policy of the alternative government of the country, in two years, was to push up the cost of housing and enrich people who already owned houses. But now they have a second policy: the nuclear energy policy to push up power bills and rack up hundreds of billions of dollars in debt—and then God knows what: tax rises and cuts to other services?—in their nuclear fantasy. So it's a difficult competition—the member for Bennelong, I'm sure, would agree—as to which is the dumbest of their two policies: to push up power prices or push up house prices? That's all they've got out there at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time doesn't permit the deconstruction of the last bit of the motion. It talks about the need for lower taxes. Well, here's a tip: from 1 July, every Australian taxpayer gets a tax cut under Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts—something that those opposite were not going to do. They were just going to shove it to those earning the most. On cutting wasteful spending, here's a tip: we've cut over $70 billion of wasteful spending. That has led to the first two surplus budgets this country has seen in nearly 20 years. The bloke who spoke before me, the member for Groom, said, 'We need a surplus,' and spoke of 10 years of deficits. You know where the 10 years of deficits were? They were under their government. Under their government, they racked up a trillion dollars of Liberal debt, with nothing much to show for it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300120" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PIKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  I rise in support of this important motion from the member for Groom. I know that Labor is a party that enjoys higher taxes and higher cost of living; we have certainly seen that play out over the first couple of years of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, come 1 July, Labor has yet another tax for the Australian people. It's a tax on superannuation and a direct attack on all Australians who work hard. Superannuation is important for all Australians. It has become, of course, an essential contribution in assisting Australians to retire comfortably. At its heart, super is a reward for a career's worth of hard work, but this Labor government sees superannuation not as money belonging to hardworking Australians but as another opportunity to raise revenue. This tax will hurt Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor claims it will only affect a few—and we heard those arguments just before—but the Grattan Institute rightfully points out that it has found, through its analysis, that, within 30 years, one in every 10 workers will be stung with this tax when they retire. Given the amount of inflation we've seen over recent years, who knows how many more will be affected over the course of those three decades. That number alone is 200 times more than the number Labor is predicting it will impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Monopoly, there's a square you can land on called 'Super Tax'. It sits between the two most sought-after properties on the board and just before you collect $200 for passing go. Just when you thought you might get ahead, the super tax on the Monopoly board is, of course, a kick in the guts. Similarly, Labor's super tax is a kick in the guts to all hardworking Australians, because it means that the superannuation that they have accumulated to retire on is reduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The future of super, which this Labor government threatens, is important to all Australians, but especially so, of course, to younger Australians. We heard from the member for Groom about the impact that this will have on some of our farmers. But of course the massive impact will be on future generations of Australians who will have to face the impact of this unindexed threshold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the coalition, we believe in the importance of young Australians being empowered to utilise their super. We want young Australians to be able to save and build their super for retirement, if they choose. But, as a housing crisis has emerged, as we have seen under the failure of this government—and of state governments, I note—to boost housing supply, we want those young people to have the option to use a small amount of their super to help towards a housing deposit so that they can break into the housing market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time the topic of superannuation emerges, our Labor opponents immediately try to take some sort of moral high ground on this front, and we have seen that already from the member for Bruce. They claim we're coming after young Australians by daring to give them the financial freedom to utilise their own money for what they need. We've seen the studies: we've seen that the major factor that impacts on or influences an Australian's ability to have a comfortable retirement is whether they own their own home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what our coalition policy is about, in allowing people to access their super. Once they've realised that asset—once they've sold the asset—they have to add the funds, plus a return, back into their super account. It's a policy that makes sense. It's a policy that's actually implemented in super schemes across a whole range of other Western nations that have similar arrangements to us. It's certainly a policy whose time has come. It's a policy that I'm sure many young Australians are looking forward to casting their ballot on, whether it be later this year or early next year, in relation to having the opportunity to use some of their funds to climb that first step on the housing ladder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are playing with Australian workers' futures to try to fix the shambolic economic mess they presided over. They continue to tax so that the Treasurer can get up on budget night trumpeting about a surplus budget. But, as the member for Groom noted, it's a short-term surplus for long-term pain. While Australians struggle, the taxes pile up and inflation will increase. Of course, this isn't just a tax on the richer end of Australian society. As we head into the coming decades this will be a tax on every Australian. It's a tax on the future of young Australians. As this tax will only really become apparent to many Australians once they reach retirement age, Labor's plan is to covertly welcome super taxes into our system. We know that the current economic situation is tough, and we know it's only going to get tougher under this government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  This motion, while wrapped in concern for young Australians and their financial future, is nothing more than another example of the Liberal Party's ongoing attack on our superannuation system. It's an affront to the principles underpinning the security and dignity of retirement for millions of Australians. But, to be honest, it shows the consistency of the Liberals' attitude towards super and its purpose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor built the superannuation system. We have always been, and will always be, the party that stands for a fair and secure retirement for all Australians through a fair system of compulsory savings. The superannuation system was created by Labor in 1992. It is one of the great economic and social success stories of our nation. It has grown into a nearly $4 trillion pool of savings, making it one of the largest pension funds in the world. This system is not just a collection of individual accounts. It's a collective promise that every Australian should have a dignified retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Groom's motion notes the importance of superannuation, especially for young Australians. I couldn't agree more. However, the actions of those proposing this motion speak louder than their words. Time and time again the Liberal Party have shown that their true intent is to undermine the very foundations of what makes our superannuation system great. The Liberal Party's track record speaks for itself. They opposed super when it was first brought into this place, arguing that higher contributions would reduce take-home pay and burden employers. They have opposed increases to the superannuation guarantee rate. They've frozen it, and they've delayed planned increases. They have continually tried to undermine and interfere with industry super, attacking its governance and fund arrangements, all while industry super outperforms its competitors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, during the pandemic, they allowed the early release of super—against advice—resulting in around $36 billion being withdrawn from super accounts in a matter of months. They let young people raid their retirement savings to underpin their flawed response to the pandemic. It will cost these young people, and it will cost our country in due course. A young person who took advantage of Scott Morrison's scheme is estimated to be $120,000 worse off in retirement. But what those opposite failed to acknowledge is that these contributions are essential for ensuring that workers have enough savings to retire comfortably. They suggest that we should allow first home buyers to do the same—to use their superannuation savings to purchase property—which sounds like a nice idea on the surface, before you take a second to look at the facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Analysis has shown that such a policy not only would fail to increase housing affordability but would likely inflate median city property prices by around $75,000. This would make homeownership more out of reach for many young Australians—the very opposite of what the policy claims to achieve. Moreover, and most importantly, it would erode the retirement savings that these young Australians will rely on in the future. This is not a solution. It's a disaster in making both housing affordability and retirement security even harder. It would strip away the future financial security of young Australians under the guise of homeownership. Instead of creating a pathway to owning a home, it would drive up house prices and deepen the housing affordability crisis. If the coalition were serious about housing affordability, they would support measures in the parliament aimed at increasing supply. Instead, they propose this reckless policy time and time again, one that they took to the last election, which they were defeated at, that seeks to attack compulsory superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government, on the other hand, is acting to protect the integrity of the superannuation system for all Australians. We want to protect and strengthen it. We are focused on legislating the objective of super to ensure that it remains a robust system that can't be dismantled in short-term political interests. We are committed to policies that support Australians in both their working lives and their retirement. The superannuation system is not just a financial mechanism; it's a cornerstone of social equity in Australia. It ensures that people from all walks of life can build a nest egg that supports them in retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals' repeated attacks on the system are not about protecting young Australians; they are about undermining a collective system that they have historically ideologically opposed. This motion is just a thinly veiled attempt to justify policies that would harm the long-term financial security of Australians, particularly the young. Their continual attacks on super, where they want Australians to raid their balances, must be opposed at every turn.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  Thank you to the member for Groom for putting forward this very important motion in response to yet another one of the Albanese Labor government's harebrained ideas. Let me set the scene for you. The year is 2024, and, instead of living the Australian dream, we're stuck in a Labor created nightmare. Every Australian is struggling through this Labor created cost-of-living crisis. Inflation has skyrocketed. Groceries and fuel are becoming increasingly impossible to afford. The energy future of this country is in jeopardy, and those opposite won't even have a mature conversation about it. Our rural and regional roads are in disrepair. Our primary industries are warding off attack after attack. Hardworking young Australians everywhere are barely able to afford the necessities, let alone save for a house deposit or make any real plan to safeguard their future, because under Labor their future looks bleak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In times of hardship, a reasonable person might start thinking about how they can help a person who's struggling, but we know that the Labor government is not reasonable. Instead, while Australians everywhere are doing it tough, they have decided to bring in legislation that would take more money away from them. Because those on the other side of the House can't manage their own money, they come after yours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what have they done? By introducing the Treasury laws amendment bill 2024, the Albanese Labor government has broken yet another one of their promises. Despite making promises, before the election, of no changes to superannuation, the Albanese Labor government are doubling the amount of tax that Australians will have to pay on their superannuation, which now takes that tax that they will collect from the Australian public's hard-earned superannuation from 15 per cent to 30 per cent. But don't worry; they're only doubling the tax for people who have $3 million in their super accounts. 'It won't impact that many people,' said the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The single biggest issue I have with this bill is that there is no indexation. According to comments by the Grattan Institute, within 30 years about one in 10 workers will begin to retire with super balances that will be subject to the Labor government's higher taxes on superannuation. That is 200 times more people that will be impacted by this bill than the government is claiming. Who are the people who are retiring in 30 years time? Those young Aussies who are barely making ends meet because of this Labor created cost-of-living crisis—the very same Australians struggling to pay their bills, struggling to put fuel in their cars and struggling to put food on the table, who have no money left over by the end of the week to put into savings, let alone being able to top up their super from time to time so they don't have to rely on the government as they get older and can't work anymore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just doubling the tax wasn't enough, though, because those opposite want to impose this tax on unrealised capital gains as well. So, even if the younger generations can afford to break into the investment market through a self-managed super fund, they might be asset rich but cash poor, and if their land valuation increases they have to pay tax on it. They will be paying tax on paper gains, and that is absolutely ridiculous. This does not happen anywhere else in the world—nowhere. But that's exactly what the Albanese Labor government's going to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a blatant cash grab from those opposite, and that is why I need to be on the record supporting the member for Groom's motion today. Those of us on this side of the House get out of bed every day and try to make lasting and positive change for the people of Australia, and that's why we're calling on the government to abolish their plans to introduce higher taxes on superannuation. We're calling on the government to enable young Australians to use their tax advantaged superannuation contributions to buy their first home, which at present is so far out of reach, and we're calling on the government to protect all Australians from a bleak future as a result their economic mismanagement. We need to lower taxes, cut the wasteful, inflationary spending and end this current Labor created costs-of-living crisis.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  Above all else in this country, we believe that all of those who call Australia home deserve a fair go. This idea of fairness and egalitarianism should be so ingrained in us as a people that it is part of our national identity. Superannuation was founded on this idea. We believe that those who've worked all their life to build this country for the better deserve to be well looked after in their retirement. Labor established the universal superannuation system, and, like Medicare and the NDIS, this nation-building policy continues to improve Australian lives. The superannuation system now has a capital pool of nearly $4 trillion, which represents one of the world's largest pension funds, despite us being only the 13th-largest economy. The average Australian now receives around $200,000 from their superannuation fund to support their dignified and comfortable retirement. I'm sure the member for Dawson would realise that not many battlers have got $3 million in their superannuation fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the superannuation system could be even fairer, and that's exactly what the Labor government is focused on delivering. Superannuation rightly gives generous tax concessions to Australians building up their retirement savings, and it encourages the magic of compound interest. Our proposed changes would impact the 0.5 per cent of people with a superannuation account balance over $3 million. These changes do not remove tax concessions for the 0.5 per cent of people with over $3 million in superannuation but would reform them to ensure that it's fairer and more sustainable. If you've got $3,000,001 in super, that dollar over $3 million would be taxed at 30 per cent and the dollar below $3 million would be taxed at 15 per cent. Our changes do not alter the amount of money that can be invested in super funds, and they only apply to future earnings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the super system is dedicated to the principles of fairness, I'm not surprised that those opposite are completely incapable of understanding the purpose of superannuation: a dignified retirement. But the utter contempt that we've seen from those opposite for the idea of working people having a dignified retirement is quite amazing. I know that those opposite allowed Australians to withdraw super during the pandemic, and that cost Australians nearly $40 billion in savings—savings that were meant to last them a lifetime. It was private stimulus that was good for the economy, and it certainly helped a lot of sectors during the pandemic, but it wasn't without great private cost. A young person could be as much as $120,000 worse off in retirement because of the financial recklessness of the coalition. We heard about ending the weekend and we've heard that the member for Dickson now wants to end your retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: the coalition is engaged in an all-out attack on the rights of Australians to access a good, healthy retirement. They did this while in government, and now in opposition they're vowing to do it again by facilitating Australians to dig into their retirement savings and use their super to buy their first home. Let's be clear: there is no aspect of the member for Groom's plan that is good for Australians. Firstly, the coalition's housing plan would not actually build any new houses, when we know that supply is the issue. Secondly, the Super Members Council has shown that the coalition's plan would drive up the cost of housing by around $75,000—nice work, geniuses! Thirdly, it would have a devastating impact on the retirement savings of millions of Australians, as I said, by demolishing the magic of compound interest. No new homes, increasing the cost of existing housing and destroying a comfortable retirement. It sounds like this policy was cooked up in one of their nuclear reactors!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  John Kerin, when he delivered his 1991 budget, said superannuation is the cornerstone of encouraging greater self-provision that will help improve retirement living standards and will reduce the budgetary cost of the pension system as the population ages into the next century. I do rise to speak on this motion, brought by the honourable member for Groom, which concerns the way that the Albanese Labor government is now taxing superannuation, bringing in taxes that were not announced or discussed during the election period and that will particularly affect younger Australians. At the moment, younger Australians are already facing a cost-of-living crisis, with less money in their pay cheques each week. Now this government is going to ensure they have less money into the future as well, because this government is now increasing taxes on our superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1992, in Australia we've had an enforced savings scheme with compulsory superannuation, but governments—and this government in particular—need to remember that this is Australians' own money. It is Australia's money to deliver quality of life in retirement, not a piggy bank for governments to tax and spend. Despite the promise, before the election, of no changes to superannuation, the government is now proposing to effectively double superannuation taxes on one in 10 Australians by the time they retire. When the government brought the legislation in, it said, 'There will only be a few of you affected.' That is not true, because the government has failed to index the taxation threshold, which means that, at the moment, the average 25-year-old in Australia will be paying this tax, double the tax that is currently being paid on superannuation balances over $3 million. Analysis of ATO and census data reveals that more than two million Australians currently under the age of 25 will also be slugged with this tax. How can this government in any way say that it is trying to look after younger Australians now and into the future? It should be empowering and incentivising younger Australians to save for a comfortable retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Confidence in our superannuation system is always eroded whenever governments come in and make ad hoc changes to superannuation that were not accounted for. When people are planning for retirement, they do it as a long-term strategy. They get advice and then, without anything being said about it before the election, this government comes in and is effectively doubling the rate of tax on superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even worse than that, this government is also going to tax unrealised capital gains. This means that Australians will be paying tax on paper gains. This will especially affect farmers and also a lot of small-business owners, who may move assets into their superannuation scheme. They will now be paying tax on that even though those assets are not, in fact, income generating. This is an abhorrent use of the tax policy. Taxation of unrealised gains is particularly unfair to people such as farmers and small-business owners. We can look, for example, at what Mr Peter Burgess of the SMSF Association said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Taxing unrealised capital gains is a tax on market movements and changes in asset values, not on income … </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, in bringing in this tax, is in fact going against all of the usual principles for the way that taxes should be imposed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're on superannuation, I've previously spoken about the links between superannuation funds and the union movement. I particularly commend the work of Senator Andrew Bragg in the other place, who has recently pointed out that superannuation funds paid $10 million in political payments to unions from 2021 to 2022. Superannuation needs to be looked at, but not in the way that this government has taxed it in this latest budget. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  I rise to support the motion before us by the hardworking member for Paterson. As the member has quite rightly pointed out, the Albanese Labor government is delivering a fiscally responsible government that supports Australians, while investing in a better Future Made in Australia. The budget is designed to help people under pressure, while supporting Australians for the future. It is no surprise that the No. 1 priority is easing cost-of-living pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 July this year the Albanese Labor government will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer, which is 13.6 million people. This includes 86,000 residents in my community in Pearce. Every single taxpayer will receive a tax cut. The average tax cut for taxpayers in Pearce will be $1,018. Whether you are a nurse, a teacher, a police officer, a tradie or working in retail or other industry, we will deliver a bigger tax cut for Middle Australia to help with the cost-of-living pressures. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The energy rebate will also be of enormous help to families living in Pearce and across the country. We are strengthening Medicare by growing the number of urgent care clinics, delivering more free mental health services, delivering higher Medicare rebates for many common medical tests and listing new medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Everyone in Pearce who accesses PBS medicines is set to save even more, thanks to our freeze on the maximum cost of a PBS medicine. Pensioners and concession card holders in Pearce will not pay more than $7.70 for their PBS medications for the next five years, and this has been overwhelmingly well received by our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government have an ambitious plan to build 1.2 million homes by the end of the decade. Our plan means we are training more tradies, funding more apprenticeships and growing the workforce, and we have announced 20,000 extra fee-free TAFE and VET places in housing and construction. We are kickstarting construction by cutting red tape and providing incentives to state government to get homes built more quickly. We are delivering the biggest investment in social housing in more than a decade, to help reduce homelessness. For renters doing it tough, we have increased rent assistance, which means over 5,000 families in Pearce will receive assistance with rent. Our ambitious Homes for Australia plan will help more Australians rent, build and buy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is investing in a better future, recognising the need to create new, secure, well-paid jobs in our regions and our suburbs and a new generation of advanced manufacturing. A significant part of our $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia package will help us become a renewable energy superpower, with measures designed to maximise the economic and industrial benefits of the move to net zero and secure our place in a changing global economic landscape. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, we're also supporting small business and making sure they play a central role in our plans for a Future Made in Australia. The budget provides support for over 12,000 small businesses in Pearce and across the country. There are two major industrial centres in the Pearce electorate, which currently incorporate a number of manufacturing businesses, and I am aware that some businesses are already exploring options for new opportunities in advanced manufacturing research and development, including commercialisation, aimed at getting the maximum benefit of our natural resources in Western Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with the member for Paterson: the Albanese Labor government has without doubt proven to be a responsible economic manager and has delivered back-to-back budget surpluses. We have saved and reprioritised $77.4 billion of spending since coming to government. We are strengthening and rebuilding the public sector and have achieved savings by reducing spending on consultants and outsourcing contractors. Since coming to government, we have limited real spending growth and improved the budget position by a forecast $214 billion over the six years to 2027-28 compared to the former government. These budget measures that we have announced are considered fiscally responsible and will without doubt help lay the groundwork for a better future for all Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I rise to speak against this motion that relates to the economic management, or should I say the economic mismanagement, that has been demonstrated in the last budget brought down by the Albanese Labor government. This has again demonstrated that this is not a government that is interested in governing for all Australians. The motion here talks about easing cost-of-living pressures, building more homes for Australians and investing in a future made in Australia. If only that were the case. This budget has not eased cost-of-living pressures for most Australians, for Middle Australians, for those Australians who have again been forgotten by a Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we turn first of all to cost-of-living pressures, this is the main issue that people in my electorate of Hughes talk to me about. Over the past two years, we have seen government spending of Whitlamesque proportions, spending largely in the wrong areas, government mismanagement and waste. That government spending has led directly to the cost-of-living pressures. It is for this reason the RBA has set its inflation target rates at two to three per cent for the government. For three budgets in a row, the government has failed, on each occasion, to bring its own fiscal policy into line to bring that inflation rate down. That is the reason we have seen 12 interest rate increases over the life of this government. That is the reason that the average Australian household is now paying $24,000 a year more in mortgage repayments than two years ago. That is the reason that property investors have had to lift rents. And that is the reason that rents have increased in this country by, on average, 9.1 per cent over the past two years, according to CoreLogic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With housing the largest individual item of expenditure for Australian budgets, this demonstrates the government's failure on the cost of living. In fact, Labor's spending has further fuelled inflation. The best way that the Labor government could address cost-of-living pressures would be to lower inflation through decreasing its own spending, through cutting the wasteful spending in the wrong areas. That would then pave the way for the RBA to cut interest rates. It would then provide some relief for Australians paying off mortgages and relief for Australians paying rent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can talk about the government building more homes. The government talks a big talk on this. We've had the headlines of $10 billion going into housing, with 1.2 million homes to be built over the next five years. Yet we have a housing affordability crisis in this country. It has been there for a number of years, but it has got progressively worse under this government. Under this government, there has not been a single home built in two years, despite all of the headlines. The government has failed to address the critical lack of supply. The government has also fuelled demand for housing with its rampant migration policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the highest rate of migration in Australia now since the 1950s—almost one million new immigrants over two years. For every four immigrants coming into this country, we are building only one dwelling. The maths just do not stack up. While sustainable and sensible immigration is applauded, and immigration has built our country—I am supportive of sensible immigration—this government's current immigration policy is failing Australians. It is clueless and it is also cruel. How can we realistically ask others around the world to come to our country and yet not provide them with sufficient housing and sufficient infrastructure? It's also grossly unfair to the Australians who are already living here who are trying to get into the housing market, whether that be into private ownership or into private rental.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that is great at headlines and great at slogans but not great at all on delivery. To build 1.2 million homes over five years requires 240,000 new homes each and every year. Labor's own National Housing Supply and Affordability Council has said there is no chance Labor will reach its housing targets. So Labor's own people say it can't reach its housing targets. What we have seen, though, is what Labor governments do best. Straight out of the Whitlam playbook and the Rudd playbook, we've built a bureaucracy, and it's just come out that $30 million has been spent by this government on consultants and executives, with its housing agency yet to build a single house.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  The government has introduced a responsible budget that will help alleviate cost-of-living pressures whilst also laying the foundation for a stronger and more resilient economy. We understand that household budgets are tight and that cost-of-living pressures are being felt right across the country. That's why we've delivered responsible cost-of-living relief in this budget, building on the targeted relief of last year's budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our cost-of-living tax cuts will benefit every Australian taxpayer, with 13 million Australians set to receive a tax cut from 1 July—a matter of days away. This translates to an average tax cut of more than $1,700 dollars a year for the average worker in Bennelong, and every single taxpayer in Bennelong—all 92,000 of them—will benefit from these cost-of-living tax cuts at the right time. This will put money back into the pockets of every working Australian. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget will also provide new energy bill relief for every household, with $300 for each home and $325 for one million small businesses across the nation. This is real, tangible help for those struggling to keep up with rising energy costs. And let's not forget that those opposite have voted against energy relief in the past. We urge them not to repeat their mistakes with this rebate. Opposing these measures will only hurt households and businesses already under pressure. In addition, we've increased Commonwealth rent assistance again, marking the first back-to-back increase in three decades. This boost, combined with our energy bill relief, is designed to directly reduce inflationary pressures, directly benefiting nearly a million households. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond immediate relief, our budget is focused on investing in the future. We are committed to building more homes for Australians, with $6 billion allocated for new housing measures. This investment will help address the housing crisis and ensure that more Australians have access to a safe, affordable home. The extra $6 billion in this budget brings total investments into housing by this government to over $30 billion, an extraordinary amount in two years and a stark contrast to the decade of nothing under the former government. We need more homes for young people, but young people also deserve cost-of-living relief. Our HECS reforms—wiping $3 billion of student debt—will benefit 23,800 people in Bennelong, making higher education more accessible and affordable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've invested in cost-of-living relief in homes and for students, but we also need to invest in our future. As the world decarbonises, we need to be at the front of the pack. We need to make sure that we benefit from the environmental and economic gains of a clean energy transition. Our commitment to a future made in Australia is evident in our support for low-emissions energy manufacturing. We are building a stronger, more resilient economy by supporting Australian businesses and creating Australian jobs, while the alternative is more interested in fear and division. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition claim to care about a net zero economy but have actively sabotaged Australia's switch to renewable energy. They reject the plan to ensure we build batteries and solar panels here locally, but then they complain that we import too many of them. They vote against energy relief and price caps but then complain that power bills are too high. You see the pattern here? The Liberals and Nationals are not interested in fixing the issues they created; they just want to be wreckers. You just need to look at their budget reply to reveal their real intentions. How many measures did the Leader of the Opposition announce to help families with the cost of living? None. How many policies did they propose to reduce the cost of essential medicines? Zero. And what was their grand plan to create better jobs and higher wages? There wasn't one. The only policies they announced on housing were to let young people wipe out their super balances and then, of course, to shamefully blame migrants for every problem under the sun.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side, we will increase housing supply, protect super and embrace migration and its benefit to our nation. On that side, there is no plan, only old ideas, fear and division. The government's budget is one for all Australians. It's a budget crafted with care and responsibility, addressing the immediate cost-of-living pressures we face whilst also building a foundation for a positive future. Our budget provides real solutions and investments and responsible economic management, and I commend them to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  Another motion about economic management from those opposite. Another motion patting themselves on the back for the great job they're doing, when in reality the Australian people are suffering. We all know there's not one Australian who's doing better today than when Anthony Albanese and Labor came to government in 2022, but those opposite continue to pat themselves on the back, and my community know that it's all spin. Let's be specific and look at point (2)(b)(iii): 'saved and reprioritised $77.4 billion of spending since coming to government'. They're fancy words, but my community knows what that means. That's $100 million cut from my community for the roads for community program. That's $100 million taken out of Casey, the Yarra Ranges, the Yarra Valley and the Dandenongs and given to Daniel Andrews, the state Labor government and the Suburban Rail Loop. That's what has happened for my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear: it is a program that was committed to in 2019, with bipartisan support, for 10 years. The then shadow minister for infrastructure, now the Prime Minister, committed to that funding. It was a project that was being delivered on time and on budget. It was a project that the department itself admitted improved the safety of residents in the Yarra Ranges, the Dandenong Ranges and Casey. It was a program that was delivering economic benefits and productivity growth. It was ensuring that families in my community could play in their front yard without their children or their grandchildren being covered in dust and inhaling that dust. What did those opposite do when they came to power? They cut that money. They cut that $100 million, despite agreeing to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I've been campaigning ever since to get it renewed, to get the money put back into the budget. It's why I had the shadow assistant minister for infrastructure, Tony Pasin, out with me last week talking to residents. That's why I'm urging residents to go to our national road survey and add their voice to this petition. This government does not care about infrastructure spending unless it's for the Suburban Rail Loop or the inner city. They don't even care about the west. They were happy to pull lots of funding out of the west, like the airport rail link. One project in Victoria is all they care about—and they can't deliver that, because none of their projects are being delivered on time. They pat themselves on the back at a time when my community is struggling. Everyone is struggling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to read a quote from Thomas, who is 18, from Wesburn. He wrote to me about his struggles: 'The cost-of-living crisis is getting far too out of hand, and Australians need some relief. This is my first year working. I work for $21.50 an hour in a factory far, far away from my home in Wesburn. My family has always struggled financially, but all of us receive an income, and, despite that, money still doesn't work out. I don't know what relief could seriously be provided to our citizens, but it's more than overdue for a mention to the powers that be. I'm tired of worrying about this stuff. It's an extra burden when I'm meant to be at the funnest stage of my life. The same goes for all the other kids my age in the Yarra Valley.' Thank you, Thomas, for sharing your story as we stand and have to listen to those opposite telling us how the Australian people have never had it better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear: last year their answer to the cost-of-living crisis was to take away $1,500 in tax relief from the Australian people. They let that measure lapse last year. They took away $1,500 from taxpayers on low and middle incomes. Then, this year, the Prime Minister broke his word in January, and he celebrated breaking his word. He's making you wait five months, until 1 July, to get $15 a week. To add salt to that wound, the government—the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and those opposite—then spent $40 million of taxpayer money to tell everyone about the tax cut that they're going to get anyway and to tell them about $15 a week. To make it even worse, at the same time that they committed $40 million to selling their broken promise, they committed $14 million to food banks across the country. It tells you everything you need to know about this government. It's all spin and misinformation; it's nothing for the Australian people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300130" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  Over the past few weeks, at every door I have knocked on—from Willetton to Myaree or from Bicton to Willagee—my constituents' No. 1 concern has been the cost-of-living pressures that so many families are feeling. The second issue on my constituents' minds and in their hearts has been concerns about their families' future. So, when constituents in my seat of Tangney ask us what we are doing to ease cost-of-living pressures, I'm proud to tell them that this Labor budget provides energy bill relief not only to them but to their neighbours, to every household in Tangney and to every household in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I talk to constituents about the tax cut that all taxpayers and 87,000 people in Tangney will receive from 1 July, I listen to people tell me how more money in their pockets will be of immediate help. Like in many families in Tangney, in my family education is everything. Like many parents in Tangney, I share the same concern for my children and the student debts they carry. My constituents and I discuss what it means for this budget to wipe out almost $3 billion in student debts and to make indexation fairer. We are helping more than three million people, mostly youngsters, in Australia. As a former TAFE student, I think it is wonderful that this year's budget builds on existing cost-of-living measures that the Albanese Labor government has already taken, like fee-free TAFE. Fee-free TAFE gives people the chance to grab an opportunity and make a change that will set them up for a better future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My TAFE experience did that for me, and it is doing that for young people like Rebecca, Anika and Gemmalyn, who I recently met at South Metro TAFE in my seat of Tangney. Rebecca, Anika and Gemmalyn are studying for a Certificate IV in Information Technology. They told me how fee-free TAFE inspired them to make a change and go into an industry that they have a real passion for. As they spoke with great enthusiasm for their learning and about the opportunities they are getting through their studies, my heart felt so warm as I could see the bright future ahead of them. I'm proud to be part of a government that is making education more accessible to all, like addressing placement poverty by funding mandatory placement for teachers, nurses and social workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor budget is a budget for all Australians. Cheaper medicines and freezing the maximum cost of PBS prescriptions for everyone will benefit many people in Tangney—senior citizens, pensioners, concession cardholders and families big and small. I'm especially proud to be part of a Labor government that will now ensure women are paid superannuation on their paid parental leave. This is simply the right thing to do. For far too long we have not supported women, and I'm proud to be a part of a government that has put in a real measure to help close the gender gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABS shows that our policy for electricity, rents and child care are all directly putting downward pressure on inflation. So many people that I talk to are struggling to balance the pressure of today with their concern for the future. This Labor budget helps people in Tangney ease cost-of-living pressures today, and it also invests in jobs, skills, energy and infrastructure to set us up for future growth. When I talk about this Labor budget to people in Tangney, I listen to their concerns, their stories and their dreams; I promise to continue raising the issues that matter deeply to them; and I share with them that in this Labor budget I see opportunity, growth and prosperity, not only to some Australians but to the whole of Australia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="267506" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KENNEDY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  I'm speaking against this motion and the budget, and that is because this government is mismanaging this budget and also the economy. Who's paying the price for it? It's everyday Australians. If we look at the cost of living, one of the biggest costs is housing. This budget does next to nothing to fix housing supply. Today, the average loan on a house or unit is $740,000—what an eye-watering figure to burden the average Australian household with—and those average Australian households are paying $24,000 more than they were just two years ago, and these are the ones lucky enough to own a house. Those that are renting are paying 9.1 per cent more in rent, with no increase to capital assets. This government is crushing Middle Australia and not listening to their concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time when we're struggling for housing supply, somehow we have builders and construction companies going out of business, and they're not going out of business in normal times; they're going out of business at record rates in the middle of a housing crisis. It beggars belief. What are the government doing at this time when they shouldn't be looking at raising interest rates? They're increasing their level of spending. Make no mistake about it: the budget and its economic management are expansionary, and, when you've got an expansionary budget with this economy, you are not going to see interest rates go down. You're going to see Middle Australia get piled with pressure and collapse underneath it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One other thing I don't think you see anywhere in this motion is a mention of productivity, and I refer to comments from the Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, from November last year, as reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">AFR</span>, about wage rises:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Although wage rises of around about 4 per cent in a normal context of productivity growth aren't necessarily inconsistent with our inflation target. If we don't have any productivity growth, they're on the high side and they're going to contribute to rises in costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given this inflationary environment, these wage rises that those opposite like to crow about are actually increasing costs, increasing inflation and leading to pressure on keeping interest rates where they are or, even worse, on increasing them. You've got the Reserve Bank highlighting this uncertainty that Middle Australia is now facing. In the seven months between these comments from the Reserve Bank governor and today, what has changed? It's only gotten worse. We've got an inflationary budget and we've seen the last reading of inflation be the highest we've had this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will try and convince you that the economy is growing, but how does it do this? It's actually record migration that's being used to paper over the weakness in the Australian economy. The truth of this growing economy is much murkier. We're in a household recession, and productivity has ground to a halt. What does this mean for the average Australian family? It means their real income is down 7½ per cent in the last two years alone. It means they can't buy as much as they could before. It means they can't afford a house and they can't afford rent. It means the 528,000 new entrants in the economy are competing for just 170,000 new homes, and this maths does not add up. The government will try and convince you and the rest of Middle Australia that the economy is growing, but you and your family are just getting poorer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are ignoring productivity. Productivity growth has been responsible for 80 per cent of the increase in living standards for the average Australian over the last 30 years. But under this government they're going backwards at now minus five per cent, and one of the lowest recordings of the last 25 years was the last one. Productivity is an integral part of making our federation work better. This government should be incentivising our states to take on productivity increasing reforms, like tackling stamp duty or tackling payroll tax. But, instead, it's just punishing state governments with its failures.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In just a single term of government, the Labor Party has allowed the critical road infrastructure in regional and remote Australia to deteriorate significantly. The current government's approach to road maintenance and the safety of its users has been chaotic, especially for those living in regional areas. In May, the Prime Minister and several other Labor ministers visited Rockhampton for Beef 2024, claiming to support the cattle industry and our region. However, their actions have failed to match their words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Central Queensland's beef corridor road network is essential, with nearly a quarter of Australia's cattle herd bred within the 457-kilometre network of roads. I take pride in the fact that the beef produced in my electorate of Capricornia is amongst the best in the world. The 2,300 farmers within this network of roads contribute an astounding $2.7 billion to the Queensland economy. This substantial sum directly funds hospitals, schools and the roads that those of us in urban areas often take for granted. The roads in South-East Queensland are some of the finest in the country, thanks to the dedication and hard work of our cattle farmers, whose efforts generate the funds needed to build them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the immense economic contributions these graziers make to our nation, they are not seeing any return on their hard work. Labor has neglected the very infrastructure that supports one of Australia's most vital industries, demonstrating a lack of respect and appreciation for the contributions of regional and remote communities. Unlike the current government, the former coalition government could see how important the beef corridor road network is for farmers, with interconnected road infrastructure being a critical part of agriculture's supply chain from west Queensland to east Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Feedlot operator David Kemp from Lotus Creek said, 'Proper road infrastructure would expand out markets, increase accessibility to important infrastructure for both our families and business and reduce the disruptive impacts caused by standard weather events.' The coalition recognised the critical need to upgrade these essential roads to enhance supply chains, ensuring that suppliers could deliver their products to the market more quickly and safely. This initiative was aimed at boosting economic activity and creating more job opportunities. With the strong backing of the seven councils in the region, we pledged a substantial $400 million in 2022 to seal 457 kilometres of road infrastructure, bringing it up to 21st-century standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I was shocked and deeply disappointed to learn during Senate estimates earlier this year that the $400 million investment had been delayed until the 2027-28 financial year. This delay is particularly frustrating, given that preparations were already underway, with shovels ready to break ground next year. This decision by the Labor government highlights their blatant disregard for not just the agriculture sector but all those who live and work in regional and rural Queensland. Labor's actions not just are a setback for infrastructure development but also pose a risk to the lives of people who rely on the regional roads for their daily travel. The government's apparent indifference is a serious concern for all those dependent on safe and efficient transportation in these areas. The hazardous road conditions are not only putting lives at risk but also imposing significant financial burdens on business due to the increased cost of maintaining their equipment. These dangerous roads lead to more frequent repairs and higher maintenance expenses, ultimately impacting the profitability and efficiency of businesses that rely on transportation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ken Dillon, a livestock transporter from Clermont, stated that the poor road conditions resulted in significant maintenance costs for his trucks, making it their largest expense. Ken said: 'The people who make the decisions aren't where the action is going on but in metropolitan areas. They need to be more hands on, get out and work out what's going on.' This is something I wholeheartedly agree with. The people in the bush, where the wealth of the nation is created, get left behind by decisions made in the cities. Quite frankly, those of us who live in these areas are sick and tired of our regions being bled dry by Labor. The decision by this Labor government to delay the full funding of $400 million is reckless and has created enormous uncertainty for those living and using the roads within the beef corridor network. I call on the minister for infrastructure to step up and reinstate the original funding profile of $400 million back to the 2025-26 financial year start date to ensure that the much-needed road upgrades can begin. This will allow the beef industry to deliver its high-value product to market and get those who use the roads home safely.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  Let's be clear: the Albanese Labor government is delivering the beef corridor road project, something the coalition talked about but didn't deliver in their nine years. The funding for this project has not been delayed. This idea of funding profiles being cut is simply nonsense. The coalition allocated fake funding to this project. It's another example of all announcement and no delivery from the former coalition government. The reality is that the Queensland government has undertaken rigorous planning for these projects, and they're now moving into the construction phase. Here's the thing: the funding profiles reflect the real deliverable milestones of the project. We're a government focused on actually delivering projects, not issuing press releases alone. Undertaking the proper design, consultation and procurement for these initiatives takes time and ensures the projects that are built are the right ones in the right locations and to the right budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know Central Queensland is Australia's heartland for beef production. The region is set to benefit from the development and progressive delivery of $500 million in upgrades to priority road projects that support the beef industry in Queensland. Queensland's beef corridor network extends nearly 218,000 square kilometres and runs east to west across Central Queensland—and, yes, I have been there. The strategic web of roads carries world-class beef products and contributes billions to the Queensland and Australian economies. Upgrading the beef corridor network will increase productivity across agriculture and the resource industry and improve safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is partnering with the Queensland government and working with seven local councils and key industry stakeholders on the identification of short-, medium- and long-term beef road priorities to inform a 10-year Central Queensland beef roads investment strategy. This includes Barcaldine Regional Council, Central Highlands Regional Council, Gladstone Regional Council, Woorabinda Aboriginal Shire Council and many others, who have been advocating for infrastructure investments to improve the road in forming part of the state's beef supply chain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To kickstart the initiative, on 13 March this year the Miles Labor government announced the first stage of construction, with early works expected to commence progressively from 2024-25, and we're getting this done. The project is being funded on an 80-20 basis, with the Albanese government committing $400 million as part of last year's MYEFO and the Queensland government contributing $100 million, including the Queensland Transport and Roads Investment Program 2023-24 to 2026-27. These roads upgrades will provide safer and more efficient transport solutions across the area. We are engaging with the local councils and industry stakeholders to develop that 10-year strategy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate, we're investing $177 million in the Warrego Highway to improve the safety and capacity of this vital transport link. We're investing $470 million of funding for the entire Warrego Highway in the budget. Why is this critical? Because the Warrego is one of Queensland and Australia's main freight corridors and supports the beef supply chains. It's part of a $2.5 billion investment for Queensland in the budget, including $453.5 million in the central west corridor, $111.7 million in the Capricorn Highway pavement strengthening and widening packages 1, 2 and 3, and $45.5 million in the Springsure to Tambo upgrade. Make no mistake: we are partnering with the Queensland government, and we're backing the industry. It's really, really critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not long after all of this back in May, including the Prime Minister attending Beef Week, we announced that China was lifting the suspension of imports from several Queensland meat-processing plants, including JBS Dinmore and Kilcoy Global Foods abattoirs in my electorate, along with other abattoirs and beef processing facilities in Caboolture and near Toowoomba, resuming red meat exports to China, one of our biggest export markets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a great outcome for meat processors in my electorate and for workers in my electorate, not to mention the cattle producers and the wider red meat and beef processing industry in Queensland. I want to thank Don Farrell, Minister for Trade and Tourism, for the work he's done in relation to that matter. It shows that the Albanese government is delivering for Queensland cattle producers and for Central Queensland. The Liberal and National Parties should stop misleading the community and acknowledge the fact that it's this Labor government delivering more for regional Queensland and the Queensland beef industry in less than two years than the coalition ever did.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:19</span>):  I'm proud to second the member for Capricornia's motion as I too understand the importance of the beef industry and the need to upgrade the beef corridors. The motion acknowledges that the cattle industry within the Queensland beef corridor road network consists of a quarter of the Australian cattle herd population. This is an important contribution to the Queensland economy, worth $2.7 billion. The beef corridors consist of a 457-kilometre road network, which serves as a crucial interconnected system for agricultural supply chains spanning from east to west. This infrastructure facilitates the seamless movement of premium beef throughout every stage of the production cycle.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beef produced within the beef corridor road network is of world-class quality and is transported on dangerous, substandard roads. But don't just take my word for it; these are some of the comments from local mayors within the councils of the Flynn electorate. The Mayor of Banana Shire Council, Nev Ferrier, said: 'There are three meat processing plants in Central Queensland: two in Rockhampton and one in Biloela. Between them, they employ 2,000 people and rely on delivery of up to 3,000 head of cattle per day. We need to be able to get the road trains from Central Queensland to the Gladstone port via the Capricorn, Burnett and Dawson highways via Dululu, Biloela and Gladstone. Beef corridors will also benefit our tourism industry and other strong export commodities that are transported from western Queensland to Gladstone, like grains, mung beans and chickpeas.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mayor of Rockhampton Regional Council, Tony Williams, said: 'As the beef capital of Australia, Rockhampton depends on transport of cattle for breeding, backgrounding, sales and meat processing. Ensuring reliable transportation is vital to the beef supply chain and the growth of local jobs. Meat processing firms in Rockhampton, including Teys and JBS, are undertaking their own expansions to process more beef for more domestic and international markets and will rely heavily on improved transportation from across Central Queensland. Growth opportunities also exist at the Gracemere saleyards, which are currently at the mercy of a beef transportation system that hasn't changed since the 1950s. We are calling on the government to establish a reliable and robust corridor road network that will assist councils across Central Queensland.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mayor of Woorabinda Aboriginal Shire Council, Terence Munns, said: 'Ideally, we will generate an investment interest from both state and federal governments on improving beef corridors and limiting problems encountered in getting stock and products for sale. For Woorabinda, this would mean flexibility to haul cattle and produce to relevant sales and increased numbers of cattle hitting the market from the region overall.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mayor of Gladstone Regional Council, Matt Burnett, said: 'The heavy vehicle access route to the Port of Gladstone incorporates the Gladstone port access road, which currently does not allow for type 1 road train access. Upgrading type 1 road train access from the Dawson and Capricorn highways to the Port of Gladstone will reduce logistics costs and time. The Port of Gladstone is the gateway to the rich central western hinterland of Queensland and needs more efficient connections throughout the Queensland beef corridors. Accessing the Port of Gladstone can open the door for beef export as well as agricultural exports straight to the Asian markets. This improves supply chains for agricultural inputs and consumables.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mayor of Central Highlands Regional Council, Janice Moriarty, said: 'Central Highlands Regional Council is committed to the ongoing support of the Queensland beef corridors project. Reliability creates confidence, confidence drives opportunity and opportunity creates investment and employment. As a result, regions and communities are revitalised and linkages between our communities improve capacity and the sense of identity for our beef region. Despite our resilience, innovation and early adoption of 21st-century technology and our incredible superiority in genetics, we are burdened with the uncertainty and unnecessary cost that comes from an inexplicable lack of investment in road infrastructure.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022, the former coalition government committed $400 million to make the crucial improvements to the beef corridor roads. I condemn the Labor government for its reckless decision to delay the funding of $400 million to the beef corridor road network upgrades, creating uncertainty around this critical road safety project. </span>

                  </a>  The member for Hawke would get that reference, obviously. It's a common theme of those opposite to talk about important projects but fail to deliver them. They talked about an anticorruption commission, but it took a Labor government to deliver it. They promised a budget surplus, but after nine years in office all we saw were plenty of mugs; they couldn't deliver. A Labor government delivered a budget surplus in just one year, and then the first back-to-back surplus in almost 20 years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They talked about the beef corridor projects, but it's taking a Labor government to actually deliver them. The coalition, when it came to the beef corridor, were more of a beef substitute—tofu or something like that. In government they were all talk and no action; all announcement, but no delivery; big hat, no cattle. These are the people we're supposed to believe can build and regulate a safe nuclear power plant inside a decade. I wouldn't trust them to deliver a pizza. The coalition allocated fake funding for the Queensland beef corridor and—as we just heard from the previous speaker—before any due diligence was done to ensure its readiness for delivery. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a representative of the great state of Queensland, I'm very happy to inform the House—and particularly the member for Hawke, who is following this debate closely, and the member for Capricornia—that the Queensland government has now undertaken the appropriate due diligence and is proceeding with construction. I know this will come as a shock to those opposite, but, to actually deliver projects like the Queensland beef corridor, you need more than just a press release. You need proper design, consultation and procurement. All of those take time, especially in some of the regions where labour is a little bit short because there's a little bit on in Queensland at the moment. Our focus in government is on actually delivering projects, not just announcing them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This talk from the opposition about delays is quite interesting. As the member for Capricornia knows, the government has made available $401 million of actual funding, with the Queensland state government contributing $100.2 million. In March of this year the Queensland government announced the first stages of construction would begin, with the Clermont-Alpha Road in the Mackay, Whitsunday and Central West districts; the Alpha-Tambo Road in the Central West district; the Fitzroy Developmental Road, which I've travelled a few times; and the May Downs Road all to receive improvements as part of the Queensland beef corridor projects. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland beef corridor basically spans an area of 218,000 square kilometres right across Central Queensland. We're all about getting it done and servicing this important trade part of Australia. It demonstrates our commitment to rural Australia and rural Queensland. In fact, this Labor budget delivered $21.6 billion for Queensland. There are seven local councils involved in upgrading this critical network of road and improving access to the port of Gladstone. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:28</span>):  Labor should fund the beef roads to the tune of $400 million because the stakes are too high not to.

That is the Labor attitude. I do thank him for giving me one minute on this. I just want to go straight to the mayor for Central Highlands, Kerry Hayes, a good man. He says the delays were 'just wrong', and he's right.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  To recognise a duty of care to another is to recognise that there is a moral or legal obligation to ensure the safety and wellbeing of others even as you pursue a course of action that may align with your own personal best interests. While employers frequently talk about and act upon their duty of care to their employees, surely no entity could have a greater obligation to the duty of care than the government of the day. After all, as leaders of this country, surely we have no greater obligation than to leave this place better than we found it for future generations. Yet in 2021 a then-16-year-old woman, Anjali Sharma, was forced to take legal action to try to force the then government of the day to recognise and act on their obligation. At the time, Anjali argued that, in deciding whether to approve a coalmine expansion in New South Wales under the EPBC Act, the environment minister had the duty to protect young people from devastating impacts of climate change. While ultimately the court decided not to award Anjali the injunction she sought, her actions marked the beginning of an ongoing campaign to ensure our government accepts that it does have a duty to protect the right to a safe environment.</span>

Starting with just four employees, Chris has expanded the IGA's staff to 30, providing much-needed local jobs in the area. Alongside his father, John, Chris has played a vital role in establishing and maintaining Cellarbrations liquor store, the Pickled Herring restaurant and the licensed post office and newsagency. The success of these businesses reflect the Young family's commitment to and understanding of serving the needs of the local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris, John and their staff are often the first to be called upon for support, whether for advice, fundraising donations, home deliveries due to illness or even security checks after a break-in. Chris is a reliable, well-respected member of the Two Rocks community. His support for local clubs, groups and the community is outstanding. From donating meat pies to local sports clubs and sponsoring his beloved Yanchep Red Hawks Football Club to hosting pop-up bake sales for fundraising and storing groceries for residents during power outages, Chris has done it all. There is not a single community or sporting group that hasn't benefited from Chris's generosity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They say the local corner store is the lifeblood of the community, and in Chris Young's case this is absolutely true. We all say a very heartfelt collective thankyou to Chris Young.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  This is why we need a freeze and cap on rent increases. The majority of the Labor and Liberal parties might all be landlords and so might not fully appreciate the scale of the housing crisis and the impact it's having on renters, but, over the last 12 months alone, rents have increased in capital cities by 9.5 per cent. The national median rent is now $621 a week. That means that, even if you're earning $107,000 a year, in the median rental you'll still be in rental stress. The worst rent increases have been in the lowest-priced rentals. That means that, for the bottom 25 per cent of income earners, the average income they are paying on their rent is 54 per cent. In other words, the lowest 25 per cent of income earners are paying over half their income on rent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To give you an idea of the consequences of the government's refusal to put a freeze and cap on rental increases: a single mum got in touch with us—a DV survivors with a daughter on the NDIS. They've lived in the same rental for nine years. In the past 12 months, the rent has increased 20.8 per cent, up by $544 a month. She says that some days her children go without basics so she can just make the rent and they don't end up on the streets. The government knows that a freeze and cap on rent increases would work. In their own report, guess the region that has the lowest rent increases in the world right now—Europe. It's also the place with caps and freezes on rents.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I've told parliament the tale of two little boys that were born profoundly dyslexic, if that's the right word. They were like a puffed pillow statue. If you punched them, there was no reaction. If you talked to them, there was no reaction. These two little boys showed no form of life. They were born profoundly disabled. They were put under an institution called AEIOU. They are both in school. One of them is competitively in school. They are both quite exceptionally good at mathematics. When I come into the room now, he attacks me. He thinks he's Wally Lewis or something. I bash him, and we wrestle on the floor and scream abuse at each other. That is the accomplishment of AEIOU.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister, quite innocently, is rearranging the funding, and he thinks he's doing the right thing. I think he will do untold damage to the AEIOU. I don't think there is an organisation in this country that could show more effective outcomes than the AEIOU, but it's in serious danger if the legislation goes through as is. My advice is that the Senate is going to stop it. That's one of the major issues with that legislation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  Today I met with Bowel Cancer Australia advocates Mehroz Afzal, Seemab Awan, Jessica Kidd and James Barr. Mehroz and Seemab sadly lost their sister, Afroz Awan, in January 2022, only three months after she was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer and only six months after giving birth to her baby boy. Afroz was young. She was a mechanical engineer, healthy and excited for her life, with her family and her career. Sadly, she was taken away at the age of 33. Likewise, Jessica is a successful journalist with the ABC in Sydney. However, she too was diagnosed at a young age with bowel cancer, and she shared with me her story of survival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these advocates shared with me these stories of being dismissed because they were said to be too young to have bowel cancer. Bowel cancer is occurring in young people increasingly. We don't know why, but it is. Its symptoms should never be dismissed. Part of their advocacy campaign is about ensuring that individuals and medical professionals don't maintain the mistaken belief that young Australians have low to no risk of bowel cancer. They are at risk. Any symptoms need to be investigated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very thankful to Bowel Cancer Australia and their wonderful advocates for increasing awareness in our parliament throughout the week. I'm proud of the work that our federal Albanese government has done for this issue, which includes investing almost $40 million in bowel cancer screening and lowering the age for free screening, from 50 to 45. By working together, I hope that our government can enact change to improve outcomes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  Last week I was fortunate enough to attend the Chirnside Park football and netball clubs' volunteer and sponsorship night. It was a wonderful night to pay tribute to those sponsors—I'm proud to sponsor the club—and also to the volunteers that give so much to the Chirnside Park Football Club. But it's not just about Chirnside. I want to congratulate and thank all volunteers and all sponsors across the sporting clubs of Casey, whether it's football, netball, soccer, bowls or tennis. There are so many clubs and so many volunteers giving so much. All the clubs are crucial to our communities. In a regional area the football club, the netball club and the tennis club are the heart of the town. People volunteer and give up so much time, so thank you to all the volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the Powelltown Football Club celebrated, on Thursday night, the opening of their new club rooms, which had some federal government funding from the former government, and I'm sorry I couldn't be there. They're back-to-back premiers, they've had a good couple of years and they're working hard. I saw that the five Walker boys played together on the weekend, which is what community sport is all about. It's about family and connection, and it brings us together. When we've had a tough week there is nothing better than going to the club to have a kick with your mates and to celebrate and spend some time talking about what is important in life. To all the volunteers at all of the sporting clubs across Casey, I say thank you for everything you do to make sure that your club is strong so that your juniors and your women's and your men's teams can enjoy every weekend playing sport.</span>

It symbolised not just the start of the construction but also our shared commitment to serving the needs of our diverse community. With the support of the Albanese Labor government, we proudly announced the commencement of work on a new educational and cultural building. This $2.8 million project is more than just infrastructure. It is a testament to our commitment to fostering diversity and nurturing cultural heritage.</span>

Your resilience, values and tradition enrich our collective identity, making Tangney a vibrant and inclusive place to live. This milestone would not be possible without the leadership of past president Brother Muthu and the current president, Brother Ben Naidu, and the selfless contribution of all the volunteers. Through initiatives like this in the Investing in our Communities Program, we empower locals to thrive, creating a brighter future for all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  Happy birthday to the Warburton Valley CEDA. It was wonderful to be there last week to celebrate their 10th birthday. It was special occasion. The CEDA, over 10 years, have had more than 100 members and a regular program of events. It was great to be at Bulong Estate, in Yarra Junction, and I want to congratulate the president, Anna Tehan; the committee; and all the members for the great work that they do. The Warburton Valley CEDA and the township groups across Casey play such an important role in making sure that our communities are heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was fortunate to, before politics, be the founding chair of the Lilydale Township Action Group, and it's nice, six years later, to see the work of Lilydale Township Action Group in running different events, engaging with the community and keeping people engaged. But so many groups in our community do that. They play a valuable role in making sure that I as an elected official can stay connected to them and can talk to them about what is happening in the community. As I like to say, Upwey and Belgrave might be four kilometres apart, but never tell anyone in Upwey that their issues are the same as those in Belgrave, because they are unique and special communities. Every town across Casey is unique and special, and the volunteers that represent the township groups, the economic development groups and the traders groups do such an important role in making sure their voices are heard, their issues are heard and the support that they need is given to them. They volunteer their time and they do it for nothing, so I say thank you to all those groups for the work they do in Casey.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  There's a little patch of beach in Mortlake, no bigger than a basketball court, that has been lovingly cared for by a wonderful group of volunteers. Ron and Edna Cox live right next to Fairmile Cove beach, and they took the initiative to start picking up rubbish on that little beach on the Parramatta River. Over the years they've been joined by their neighbours and other locals, including Angelo and Carol Patane, Pasquale Di Leo and Katherine Barr, to help keep the local beach clean. At its peak, volunteers collected more than 30 bags of rubbish. Fortunately, they've reported that, over the years, the amount of rubbish washing up onto that beach from Parramatta River has dramatically declined. Thanks to the efforts of this amazing group of volunteers, Keep Australia Beautiful awarded Fairmile Cove beach an award for cleanest beach in 2011. It's been 25 years since Ron and Edna Cox first started cleaning that beach, and they've created a wonderful community asset. It's a hub for local residents, who meet each other regularly for a chat and a beach clean-up. They've repurposed discarded sand toys, so now there's a little play area for kids to play on. It's volunteers like these who make our community a wonderful and beautiful place to live.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  Maryborough has been hard-hit by the aged-care crisis, and government needs to do more to support older Australians, who built our country. But, in times like this, it's heartening to see organisations like Apollo Care stepping up to ensure that senior Australians can receive the care they deserve. Last week I officially opened the final six of 30 new ensuited rooms at the Maryborough Groundwater Lodge residential aged-care facility, the product of a $2 million investment to upgrade the facility.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While there, I chatted with residents Joe and Lillian. Joe has been kept busy in his retirement as the lodge's resident carpenter, producing outdoor furniture in Joe's Workshop for the enjoyment of residents, visitors and staff. Lillian is a World War II veteran and stalwart of the Tiaro RSL. The Maryborough district is Joe and Lillian's home, and the role that Groundwater Lodge plays in allowing them to age within their community is incredibly valuable. We are the lucky country because the contributions made by our senior Australians made it so. We owe it to them to ensure they receive quality, comfortable care, and that's what's happening at Groundwater Lodge in Maryborough.</span>

Recently I attended an event that encapsulated both aspects of Mrs Kennedy's quote. The occasion was William Carey Christian School's 40th anniversary thanksgiving service. It was definitely an important milestone, but also a lovely moment for the community to come together, and I was privileged to attend. I have a strong relationship with all the schools in Werriwa and not least with William Carey. Last year, for example, I was really happy to attend their wonderful production of <span style="font-style:italic;">Willie Wonka</span>, so it was a pleasure to see old friends again this year and make new ones at their thanksgiving service. The thanksgiving evening was one filled with music, prayer, memories, Bible reading and reflection. The school's motto is: 'Expect great things from God. Attempt great things for God.' There is no doubt in my mind that the evening showcased the many ways that staff, students, parents and the wider William Carey community have fulfilled the aspirations of this motto over the past four decades. I commend the current principal, Keith McMullen, on a wonderful evening, but I also recognise his predecessors Ian Wake and Warwick Wilkie and others who were part of their journey and were there on the night. Congratulations, William Carey, on 40 years. I hope to see 40 more.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  The west coast of Tasmania has finally received much-needed funding for aged-care beds in the town of Queenstown. It has taken the Albanese government three years to finally understand the pressing need, but I welcome the announcement by the government of this much-needed investment. The former Liberal-National government invested $1 million after the 2019 election, but with cost blowouts due to COVID it soon became evident that much more was going to be needed. So, in the lead-up to the 2022 election, I secured a further $3 million to alleviate this unmet need. Unfortunately, this important commitment was not matched by Labor at the time. With the project in jeopardy, I worked with the West Coast Council, contacted the federal minister and made speeches in parliament to draw attention to the need to fund this vital service. It is completely unacceptable that the region's older residents are forced out of their local communities to live in care many hours away from their loved ones. This is a region where the winters are treacherous and the road conditions are awful for those who have to visit a far-away home. The West Coast contributes enormously to our state's economic prosperity. And this investment was always a no-brainer to me.</span>

Over the course of this day, these volunteers made over 400 items, which have since been donated to the Vinnies night van, St John's of Reid and the Early Morning Centre in Civic.</span>

In the past, my part of the world has sometimes been overlooked for government funding for important community projects, but, under the coalition government, the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program was created. It funded and supported important projects for the Redlands community. This important government investment supports essential local infrastructure projects that revitalise and enhance our communities. Under the program, the Redlands has welcomed investments through CCTV for Victoria Point reserve, solar lighting for the Capalaba Regional Park, digital connectivity for the IndigiScapes Centre, new playground equipment for the Capalaba Regional Park, drainage upgrades at Birkdale and Ziegenfusz roads and pedestrian safety upgrades at the Charlie Buckler Memorial Sporting Fields. There are new clubhouses currently being built, courtesy of coalition funding. There are also stormwater litter baskets for Raby Bay, Coochiemudlo foreshore equipment upgrades and road-widening at Starkey Street in Wellington Point.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Communities across Australia have relied on funding through this program, but, sadly, this government has failed to uphold that commitment to our communities. Last year, the Redlands received $716,000 less than what the coalition delivered through this program, and now the government has cut this program completely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Redlands deserve better. All the communities across Australia deserve better. I call on the government to reconsider this program.</span>

But now we can celebrate Kurrajong's own artist Laura Jones, who has won the Archibald Prize for her portrait of the writer and conservationist Tim Winton. Laura is only the 12th woman to win the prize, worth $100,000, and her work captures Tim Winton as a thoughtful and humble man. Laura was also a finalist in this year's Sulman prize for her work <span style="font-style:italic;">Slidi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ng Doors</span>. When I texted with her a few days after the award, she was still on cloud nine. So we are very happy for her.</span>

Their works are bold, ambitious and always topical. They're concerned with global themes, such as colonisation, consumerism, migration and environmental degradation, and their winning entry is no exception. It features two invasive species, blackberries and a camel, painted onto the back doors of a truck used for hauling freight across the Australian outback.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  Would you believe a regional centre, the Hinkler electorate, has three representatives at the Paris Olympics for 2024? I want to congratulate the three of them: Isaac Cooper for swimming, Keira Stephens as a paralympic swimmer, and Matt Hauser for triathlon. They're all incredible athletes, all very dedicated and all very hardworking.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's a little bit about their history. Isaac Cooper is just 20 years old. His hometown is Bundaberg. This is his second Olympics. He competed in the Tokyo 2020 games, and he won a bronze medal at those games as a member of the 4 x 100 metre mixed medley relay team. His junior club—and congratulations to them—is the Fairymead Swimming Club in Bundaberg, named after the sugar mill where I did my apprenticeship. Unfortunately, it's now been demolished.</span>

She also won a bronze at the women's 100 metre breaststroke SB9 and made her Commonwealth Games debut in Birmingham, also winning a bronze in the women's 200 metre individual medley. She was a Local Sporting Champions recipient in 2017.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Matt Hauser is a 26-year-old triathlete. His hometown is Hervey Bay. He attended Xavier Catholic College. It's his second Olympics, and he's currently ranked fourth in the world—from Hervey Bay in Queensland! What a phenomenal effort! He also competed in the Commonwealth Games and won gold in 2018 at the Gold Coast. Go get them. You can win. Regional people!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  On Saturday, my community rallied together in an extraordinary display of spirit at the Big Freeze in the Marsh. We witnessed incredible costumes, brave individuals taking the icy plunge and, most importantly, a community uniting against motor neurone disease. MND is a devastating disease that has touched too many lives, not only in my community but right across the country. We all know someone who's been impacted, whether it's a friend, loved one or neighbour. That's why it was amazing to see the Big Freeze in the Marsh raise a remarkable $50,000 on the weekend. It is a testament to the unwavering generosity and spirit of the community that I am so very proud to represent. </span>

I want to give a particular shout-out to Anne, Macca and the entire Bacchus Marsh Football and Netball Club. The Big Freeze in the Marsh would not have been possible without your tireless dedication. Your leadership and hard work have enabled our community to make this significant contribution to the fight against motor neurone disease. </span>

These included Baynton West Primary School, St Paul's Primary School, Wickham Primary School, Nullagine Primary School and the Port Hedland School of the Air. We spoke to hundreds of students about parliament, the Speaker and my role as the member for Durack. The quality of questions and engagement was excellent, leaving us both super impressed. Students also voted on an issue that is, quite frankly, dividing the nation. Of course, I refer to the all-important debate of pineapple: on or off pizza?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A particular highlight was our visit to Nullagine. This is a small school with a 100 per cent Indigenous cohort, for whom English is not their first language. The students described Nullagine as a good school and are excited for their new basketball rage cage. Connection to country is a key component of the school. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Speaker also joined me in meeting virtually, maybe for the first time, with students from the Port Hedland School of the Air and presenting the long-term principal, Michael Jennings, with a certificate of appreciation now that he has announced his retirement. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we would all agree here that location should not be a barrier to quality education nor experiences like I've just described with the Speaker. I'd like to thank the Speaker for coming to Durack and for meeting with regional and remote students. I'd like to give a special thanks to the teachers for their fabulous efforts in logistics and a real special shout-out to those students, who really were amazing with their engagement and made me very proud.</span>

The project was assisted with $505,000 of federal funding.

As a non-denominational college, over the years Pinnacle has not only grown in student and campus numbers but has achieved a very high student academic success rate. The number of dignitaries at the opening, too many for me to name today, made clear the high regard in which the college is held.</span>

I met with the mayor of Port Augusta, Linley Shine, yesterday and went through some of those plans. I was very pleased with at least her response.

It says that 54 per cent of South Australians believe that nuclear power has a place in Australia's future. In Port Augusta it was 72 per cent. Port Augustans were then asked whether they'd be comfortable with a reactor in their region, and 59 per cent said yes. </span>

South Australia had 71 per cent renewable electricity last year, but it's not the only race we're winning in Australia. We have the highest retail power price, by a 50 per cent margin, over the next state in Australia. No wonder people are ready for change. That's why they absolutely understand that we need something to plug the hole, and that's why the coalition is saying it will be nuclear. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  Recently I picked up some interesting reading material, the results of a True Issues survey by JWS printed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Review</span>. It outlined the issues that Australians care about, and looking at the top four issues I thought I'd do a compare and contrast. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First on the list is the cost of living, which is no surprise. The government wants every taxpayer to get a tax cut and every household to get an energy rebate. The Liberals said they'd repeal our tax cuts, and then they voted against energy relief and price caps in 2022. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second on the list is health care. In the budget we've got MRI licence reform and more Medicare urgent care clinics, including one in Bennelong from 1 July. The Liberals announced nothing in their budget reply to address healthcare costs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third item on the list is housing. We've loaded an extra $6.2 billion to speed up housing supply, bringing our total spend in two years to over $30 billion. The other side? They just want to let young people raid their super for housing, which will not only wipe out their retirement balances but also inflate property prices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth on the list is the economy. Those opposite claim to play a big game in the economy, but in reality there's no contest. The government has delivered back-to-back budget surpluses. In addition, our responsible economic management of paying down Liberal debt will deliver a staggering $80 billion in interest savings over the medium term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, we're responding to the needs of Australians, whereas they continue to show they're not up to the job.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  The House has heard me complain about regional telecommunication services on a number of occasions. Today I rise again to put on record my disappointment at the contempt shown towards regional customers by a major telco.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The district council of Loxton Waikerie and the councils of Berri Barmera and Renmark Paringa are all customers of Telstra's CSX cloud services product. That service went down unexpectedly three weeks ago, meaning that those councils lost access to data, phone, email and electronic systems, affecting critical functions of those councils and the 35,000 residents in the region. From property settlements, development applications, dial-before-you-dig requests and cemetery requests through to making payments to contractors, the outage is having a profound effect on the community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite having a service agreement that allows outages of no more than two hours, it's now been—wait for it—23 days. While Telstra is phasing out this cloud service and customers have already begun transitioning to a new service, this doesn't negate the need for them to meet their contractual obligations. I'm watching very closely and I'll be making sure these communities are compensated, so a word out to the board of Telstra. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  I had a great time getting my hands dirty recently, together with the Friends of Edendale group, at Edendale Farm in Eltham North, where we collectively helped plant 500 trees and grasses around Diamond Creek. We had local residents, kids from the Eltham Sea Scouts and older volunteers all working together. This whole project is being supported by our government's Urban Rivers and Catchments Program, delivering $150,000 to support the Friends of Edendale with their multiyear project to improve the health of this creek in my community and the area all around it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not the only great community activity that I've been able to do recently. I also recently enjoyed a visit to Ivanhoe Park to catch up with the local croquet club. I did take some lessons, and I thank the community members there for being so patient in teaching me the rules of croquet and teaching me to eventually get it through the hoop. The Ivanhoe Park Croquet Club is one of the oldest clubs in Melbourne, and I'm really happy to report that they're growing in membership in their 111th year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the other end of my electorate, the Eltham Football Club does such a great job as a community club. The Panthers recently celebrated their ladies day luncheon, where I joined my colleagues Vicki Ward MP and Councillor Nat Duffy for a fantastic afternoon fundraising for White Ribbon Australia. Thanks to Narelle and the team at the Panthers for such a special afternoon. Thanks to all the volunteers and organisations across Jagajaga. You make our community a stronger place.</span>

Today I recognise two of those who received King's Birthday honours in this year's list. The first is Fiona Shewring OAM from Maianbar, who was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for services to the building and construction industry. Fiona started out as a painter and decorator. She has been a trades teacher and started the not-for-profit organisation SALT, Supporting And Linking Tradeswomen, working to change the status quo for working tradeswomen and to encourage girls and women to consider a career in trades. Fiona has toured the country running workshops to teach young women basic tools trades, and she's known as 'the female tradie'. I'm looking forward to the day when she is simply known as 'a tradie' and not necessarily with 'female' in front of it.</span>

Dr Ward devised, published and promoted international best practice recommendations for establishing a national forensic identification program. This program laid the foundations for the AFP's National DNA Program for Unidentified and Missing Persons. Through her work, Dr Ward investigates and validates novel forensic techniques to identify skeletonised human remains. Both of these women are very well congratulated and recognised.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  Bowel cancer is the deadliest form of cancer and the sixth-leading cause of death for all Australians aged 25 to 44. Many of us think of bowel cancer as a disease for the over-50s, but sadly this is not true. Over the last three decades there has been a massive 260 per cent increase in bowel cancer incident rates in adolescents and young adults. One of them is my constituent Rebecca McMahon. Rebecca lives in Cannington, and she was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer at 37 years old. Her children were just 10 and seven at the time. For the last three years, young Lyra and Felix have endured watching their mother battle with this disease and undergo rounds of chemotherapy and surgery. It's heartbreaking, and I send her and her family my thoughts and best wishes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rebecca is brave, Rebecca is a strong and she is a fighter. She is in Canberra with Bowel Cancer Australia calling for more action on early-onset bowel cancer. Rebecca wants doctors and the community to know that you're never too young for bowel cancer. We need to raise awareness of early-onset bowel cancer. We also need to see more funding and research in this area. Thank you, Rebecca, for your strength and your advocacy. You are never too young.</span>

Just last week we celebrated the 2024 Deakin Community Awards, where more than 500 members of our community came together to recognise the countless unsung heroes and community groups who work tirelessly to strengthen our community. The awards provide an opportunity to nominate an individual or group that deserves recognition and to provide our thanks for their significant contributions. This year at the awards we recognised 71 individuals and 13 community groups who were richly deserving of their recognition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Particular congratulations go to our overall category winners: Jake Keogh from the Ringwood Football and Netball Club in the under-30s category; Gabby Knaepple from the Rotary Club of Nunawading and Eastern Emergency Relief Network in the open category; Valerie Penn from Heathmont Baptist Church in the seniors category; and Life's Little Treasures Foundation in the group category. I want to particularly point out that Jake Keogh received the overall Deakin community award for his dedicated service over many years at a very busy time in his life. I also take this opportunity to thank the Australian Children's Choir and East City Sound chorus for their wonderful performances and Nicole Werner MP for her outstanding efforts as MC. Congratulations to all of our winners and thank you to all of the community for supporting these awards.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  Last week it was great to visit RAAF Base Edinburgh, located in my electorate of Spence, alongside the Minister for Defence Personnel. That afternoon spent on base, the minister and I shared a barbecue lunch with our 1st Armoured Regiment. I'd especially like to thank Brigadier Tim Orders for his hospitality and, indeed, everyone out there for sharing some feedback and taking some time to have a chat about some of their experiences, particularly those involving the live-fire exercise that recently occurred up at the Cultana training range.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm so proud of the work that they and all others stationed at RAAF Base Edinburgh perform as part of their service, with distinction, to our country—a service that forms part of the proud history of the respective units and squadrons of RAAF Base Edinburgh, which earlier this year, back in March, celebrated its 70th anniversary. It will be a sad day when these troops leave RAAF Base Edinburgh in the near future, as speaking with them helped to brighten a very dreary afternoon in Adelaide. I'm sure the member for Solomon and the member for Herbert, whose electorates most will be redeployed to, will agree with all I've had to say about 1st Armoured Regiment once they have had the chance to meet them when they've settled in. In closing, to each and every one of our service men and women across the country in the ADF, thank you for your service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  I rise to talk about the extraordinary opportunity given to 130 primary school students from my electorate of Flinders last month. Students from grades three to six joined me at Hamer Hall for a live performance by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The program was <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he </span><span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">easant </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Prince</span>, by Melbourne composer Katy Abbott, based on the life of Li Cunxin, from the famous <span style="font-style:italic;">Mao's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">L</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ast </span><span style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ancer</span>, which forms part of MSO's Classic Kids program. The atmosphere inside the hall was electric as almost 2,500 children—and me too, I must admit—sat on the edge of their seats as Li's extraordinary life story was narrated, accompanied by Abbott's evocative music.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been a lover of the arts since I first visited Hamer Hall when it opened in 1983, and I understand the value of arts in the education and brain development of our children. I was particularly touched by one little girl sitting in front of me who was completely entranced by the performance, barely containing her excitement—at times even leaping from her seat, jumping up and down and throwing her hands into a heart shape. Move over Taylor Swift, I say! Here come the orchestra's bassoons.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This unique opportunity was provided by the rotary clubs up and down the Mornington Peninsula but especially the Rotary Club of Sorrento. I especially thank Andrea for her hard work in organising and fundraising for the first of what I hope will be many such occasions for our young people to come into the big city and hear performances of equal standards for themselves.</span>

Congratulations to all award recipients, but I want to give a special shout-out to: Max Mietzel from Newcastle, who won junior lifesaver of the year; Stuart Barnett from Dixon Park, who won Facilitator of the Year; Jordyn Haig and Will Munro from Cooks Hill, who won youth volunteer and the under 14/15 athlete of the year; and the Little Rippaz program from Nobbys, who won Community Education Program of the Year for their modified nippers program, which enables children with special needs to get involved with surf lifesaving activities. Heartfelt thanks also go to Newcastle, Cooks Hill and Merewether clubs for the critical lifesaving rescues they performed this season. Thanks also to Newcastle Permanent, who's been a long-term major supporter for surf lifesaving in our region.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the motion from the member for Holt. The member understands, like so many on this side of the chamber, the transformational nature of education and the importance of improving access to university study. That's why the Albanese government is putting in place a range of reforms in response to the Australian Universities Accord to provide cost-of-living relief and make higher education better and fairer for students, including those from low socioeconomic status or disadvantaged backgrounds, particularly in regional and suburban areas. We're making good progress on priority actions from the accord interim report recommendations. This is really important in outer suburban and regional electorates like mine, where the percentage of the population with university qualifications is quite low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the Albanese government is helping the HELP system to be fairer by improving the way HELP indexation is calculated, wiping around $3 billion in student debt for more than three million Australians, including 22,000 people in my electorate. Secondly, we're introducing a Commonwealth prac payment system to support teaching, nursing—including midwifery—and social work students complete their university placements. The government is fully funding fee-free TAFE university-ready courses to help more students prepare for university and giving them the skills they need to get into the courses they want. We've guaranteed funding for student led organisations and committed to establishing an independent national student ombudsman to investigate student complaints and resolve disputes with universities. We've announced the first 10 regional university study hubs, and we've opened 14 applications for new suburban university study hubs. They build on the 34 existing regional university study hubs across the country, which supported almost 4,000 students last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Too often someone's postcode is a brick wall that's stopping them going to university, with the cost of moving close to a campus a major disincentive to study. The postcode you live in shouldn't be a barrier to getting a degree. The opportunity is life-changing for outer suburban communities like mine in Ipswich. Today almost one in two young people in their 20s and 30s have university degrees, but not in my electorate. This has to change because, in the decade ahead, more and more jobs will require TAFE or university qualifications. That means we're going to need more people to get those qualifications—more people getting degrees, more people completing TAFE and more people in the workforce upskilling and reskilling. These community driven spaces located in outer metropolitan and periurban areas with low tertiary education participation need help. We provide convenient wraparound support targeted at underrepresented and educationally disadvantaged students who face barriers to accessing tertiary education and who would otherwise need to travel long distances to get to and from an inner-city campus. The evidence is that, where university study hubs are, university participation goes up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was the first person in my family to attend university. I want young people in Ipswich and the Somerset Region to get the same opportunities that I did. This is one way to do that—by providing higher education closer to students. I'm excited the Albanese government is doing this, and I'm very keen to see one or more suburban university study hubs established in my electorate to make it easier for young people in our community to get a degree. To that end, I've been engaging with a range of local community organisations to gauge their interest in hosting a hub. Last Friday I attended a round table at the Ipswich campus of the University of Southern Queensland attended by representatives not just from that university but from Griffith University and councils across the southern part of South-East Queensland and a number of other stakeholders looking to establish a network coordinating hub sites in Ipswich, Logan and south-west Brisbane. I'm hopeful that we see a strong proposal coming out of these discussions for a South-East Queensland south-west study hub. This hub could raise awareness and improve and advance student engagement, including preparedness, participation and engagement with academic pursuits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has an ambitious and big agenda when it comes to higher education reform, and we've set an overall tertiary education attainment target of 80 per cent of working-age people by 2050. We've estimated that, if the broader accord targets are achieved, $240 billion will be added to the economy over the period to 2050. This is about building a better and fairer education system for every Australian. It's about social justice, equality of opportunity and a fair go for young people and people who want to reskill in my electorate.</span>

                  <a href="295676" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I rise to speak on the member for Holt's motion on the Australian Universities Accord. I have spoken many times in this House about the importance of education to my family and many in my community of Fowler, and I want to share it here again. My beloved late mother, who passed away almost a year ago this week, told me while we were interned in refugee camps in Hong Kong why she chose to apply to be resettled in Australia and not the US. It was because she was told Australia has the best education system in the world. We had no idea where Australia was other than that it was this island surrounded by waters and far away from the conflicts of the world, but we heard it had quality education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the thousands of refugees and migrants who have settled in Fowler over the decades, many see education as the key to successful integration into wider Australian society. Just yesterday at lunchtime Sunday, while I was shopping in my community, I saw groups of parents and children swarming around the many tutorial centres in the city. I thought to myself that it was Sunday and yet here were the kids going to extra courses. I know that many parents, despite their current struggles with high energy and grocery bills, would prefer to cut spending in many areas but not education. Over four million students are enrolled in our education system, with over 40.5 per cent attaining higher tertiary. In my Fowler community, over 15 per cent attend university, around seven per cent are studying for a diploma and around 22 per cent of students are currently in the high school system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our education system no doubt has changed a lot since my family's settlement in Australia in 1979, and so has the world. Since my election in 2022, I have been calling on the government to cease HECS indexation to assist students, especially with increasing costs of living and in particular those in low socioeconomic areas like mine in Fowler. I therefore welcome the government's announcement in the May budget to modify the HECS indexation. My persistence and advocacy have not been in vain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I acknowledge the government's substantial efforts to reform higher education, the findings of the Australian Universities Accord report highlight the extensive work still required to secure a bright future for the next generation. The report spreads over 400 pages, with several key recommendations. Amongst the priority actions, in response to recommendation 14, the government will establish a new Commonwealth prac payment—CPP—to support students in teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work during mandatory placements. From July 2025, 68,000 eligible students can expect $319.50 per week during their placement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have previously shared that many young students often spread their money thinly across rent, food and commuting, amongst other expenses, and $319.50 is invaluable assistance to struggling students, especially those from the Fowler electorate, during the cost-of-living crisis. However, I must express concern for the students in other allied health fields. I have had physiotherapy and podiatry students reach out and ask, 'What about us?' They are feeling overlooked despite their critical role as part of the health sector. It is imperative that the government clarify whether the CPP will extend to these allied health students as well. In 2023, I established the Fowler Youth Advisory Committee, which convenes quarterly to spearhead initiatives that matter to the youth of Fowler. A recurring theme in our discussions has been the need for increased financial support for disadvantaged young people in higher education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also would like to remind the government that the 2024 budget disappointingly failed to address the inequity of the Job-ready Graduates Package from the Morrison government. This package encouraged students to pursue STEM subjects, whilst disproportionally increasing fees for arts students. The report clearly indicates that the JRG requires urgent remediation due to the financial barriers it creates. I understand the demand for STEM graduates, especially with the Future Made in Australia plan, but this approach is regressive and borderline utilitarian and has discriminatory effects. There are a significant number of female students undertaking arts and social science courses out of passion, and a continuation of the JRG will exacerbate the existing gender pay gap. Will the government advocate for a future that is short on understanding the riches of our history and philosophy? The government needs to have a long think about this. Addressing these concerns is essential to truly establishing Australia as a global leader in education.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I want to begin by acknowledging the member for Holt, who has moved this motion, because it's such a critically important policy area. We in this government know that, and that's why we're putting in place such significant reforms in response to the Australian Universities Accord to provide cost-of-living relief for students and to make higher education better and fairer for students. That's what government can do: real outcomes for the students that need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all value the importance of a good-quality education. We understand that. I'm the son of migrants from Egypt who escaped a region engulfed by war. Every day they told me, growing up, that education was so important to my future and that I needed to study, to do my homework and to get a degree to have a better life. In Australia, I received a quality education that gave me opportunities throughout life and the opportunity to make a contribution in return. Frankly, education opens the door to opportunity. It is the key that opens the door because it gives people an opportunity to actually fulfil their potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not everyone wants to, or can, do tertiary or higher education. But, for those who want that choice, there should be that opportunity—regardless of their background, regardless of their ethnicity, regardless of whether they're a migrant, regardless of whether they're from the inner city or from the regions, regardless of whether they were born in Australia or migrated here and regardless of their socioeconomic disadvantage. Education is the great leveller of our society, and it's incumbent upon all of us who were fortunate to receive such an education to make sure that more Australians are afforded these same opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the Labor government is wiping $3 billion in student debt for three million Australians, many of whom are young people who need that assistance desperately. There are young people who work in my electorate, at the checkout in ALDI in Coburg North, at the accountants on Sydney Road or at the reception at the Glenroy family clinic. These are people doing part-time work just to get through their studies—we know that experience—and the cost of living has squeezed these young people the hardest. With inflation at 7.1 per cent last year and HECS payments indexed to this inflation, young people with debts of $50,000 would have been slapped with a $3,500 indexation cost—no more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I personally know many students who have attempted to pay their fees upfront, rather than rely on HECS, to avoid those sky-high indexations. This completely defeats the point of the HECS system. No amount of sacrificing cups of coffee or breakfast is going to make a difference when you've got such a debt mounting out of your control. That's why the student debt that is here is so important under a Labor government that's here to stay. HECS loans will now be indexed to the CPI or the wage price index, whichever is lower. If your wages aren't growing, your debt shouldn't be either.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we've introduced a Commonwealth prac payment for teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students. Unpaid prac is something I've been concerned about for years. I've heard the stories of how many in my community have had to give up their paid work commitments in order to do unpaid placement that is often quite far from home. That's not good enough. We know that there is a shortage of teachers and nurses in this country. The last thing we want is for students in these professions, in this stream, to defer their studies or withdraw altogether due to the increased costs involved in placements and their reduced capacity to do paid work. That's exactly the kind of wealth barrier that our government is committed to removing, and remove it we have. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why Labor is also making sure there are fully funded uni-ready courses for these students. We want to do more than just remove barriers to education. We want to actively encourage and incentivise skills and training. That's why the Albanese government has set a target of 80 per cent of the workforce having a tertiary qualification by 2050 and it's why we're fully funding uni-ready courses. That's going to help make sure all Australians have access to an affordable, quality education. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why it's so important: education is so much more than just a commodity to be monetised; it's one of the strongest tools we have to improve our health outcomes, gender equality and socioeconomic disadvantage. The cost of living has squeezed so many young people. Under this Labor government, young people will be able to pursue their studies without the dragon of indexed debt breathing down their necks. If you're a child of migrants, you'll know what it's like to have your parents say, 'No matter what you do, just please focus on your studies because we want you to have a better life.' Not everyone can go to med school. Whether you choose to study at TAFE or get one degree or two, you should not face barriers that are insurmountable. Under a Labor government, education is an investment, not a liability.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  I'd like to begin by thanking the member for Holt for bringing this motion before us. Our government is absolutely committed to making higher education better and fairer for students. Ours is a government that believes in the transformative power of a tertiary qualification. We know the doors of opportunity that a university degree or a VET qualification can open, providing so much for people right across the country, and we know how important a tertiary qualification will become in the years ahead. That's why we're setting a new target—for 80 per cent of our workforce to have a tertiary qualification by 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This target is critical to deliver on Australia's skills needs, but, in order to reach this target, we need more people to go to university and we need them to succeed when they get there. I deeply understand the importance of higher education. It has improved the lives of people in my own family and in my community. I hear so many personal stories about that all the time. In terms of my career, I was an academic for years and a passionate advocate for post-secondary education pathways. Now I have the great privilege to represent an electorate with two world-class universities as well as leading vocational education institutions in it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that I share my deep passion for education with my community in Chisholm. There are many university students and academics who live in my community, and I know that families choose to make Chisholm their home in order to give their children a world-class education, with access to incredible higher education institutions and excellent schools in our suburbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be part of a government that is conducting once-in-a-generation reforms to the higher education system through the Australian Universities Accord. I made a submission to the accord process on behalf of my electorate. My submission was based on many conversations with constituents at mobile offices, as well as a survey that received over 400 responses. Overwhelmingly, people in Chisholm wanted to see reforms made to the Higher Education Loan Program. I heard from students who were impacted by the huge spike in indexation on their HELP loans last year and from parents and grandparents who were concerned about how rising HELP loans would impact their children's futures. Our government has listened to the community and to the recommendations of the accord expert panel, and we are changing the way that HELP indexation is calculated. We are making the HELP system fairer. These changes will be retrospective. This will mean that $3 billion from HELP debts will be cut for more than three million Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our cost-of-living relief for students does not stop there. Our government is tackling placement poverty. We know we need to better support students who are required to undertake a placement as part of their university degree. Unfortunately, we've seen students having to choose between doing their placement for their studies or working to be able to afford their rent, food and medicines. So we are introducing a new prac payment to support teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students to do their mandatory pracs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also doing more to support students on campus. Since I was an undergraduate student, which was some time ago now, I have been fighting for action to address gender based violence in higher education, which has been a persistent and awful problem for years. The rates of sexual violence at universities are alarming, and of course all students deserve to be safe at university and to feel that they can continue their studies, rather than what we have seen, where people who've been subjected to sexual and gendered violence have disengaged from study. All students deserve to learn on campuses free from gendered and sexual violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really proud to be part of a government that takes the safety of students and staff seriously, through establishing a national student ombudsman to provide higher education students with an effective trauma-informed complaints mechanism to use when they're not satisfied by their higher education provider's response. This ombudsman will be completely independent, accessible for all higher education students and empowered by a new higher education code to prevent and respond to gender based violence. Our government is doing an awful lot for students in higher education, and I'm really proud to be able to speak on this motion today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  I want to confine my remarks on this private member's motion around the Australian Universities Accord to regional, rural and more remote students. These young Australians have certainly had a really tough time under the Albanese government, with cost-of-living pressures pushing many of them, along with their families, to breaking point. They've seen skyrocketing increases in the costs of housing, power, groceries and fuel—as well as the housing crisis that's making it almost impossible to find an affordable place to live, particularly in the large cities. That's been driven by Labor's high inflation and their mismanagement of economic and policy decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm getting an increasing number of parents coming to see me about the real challenges their families are facing in the regions in just trying to support students to be able to go to university. The students in my area that want to study things like medicine, law and engineering have no choice but to move away from the south-west of the state—and others often have to move more widely, from regional and remote parts of the state—to Perth to study those courses. They are not available in a regional university within their area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The real problem we've got specifically at the moment is the actual cost of accommodation. We've seen in WA that the rental vacancy rate is extremely low, at only 0.4 per cent. When we look at student accommodation in WA, there are 27 students for every purpose-built student accommodation bed. That's the competition. So, when you're a young person coming from the south-west of the state and you have no choice but to move to Perth to pursue your education dreams and opportunities, the family really has to bear the cost of that, and at the moment, along with the high cost of living that individuals and families are facing, this is now a bridge too far. I've not seen anything from the Labor government to address that. I have seen Labor remove those rural and regional enterprise scholarships, and we also saw the axing of the Destination Australia program that supported students studying in the regions. For those students that have no choice but to move, the actual cost of rent and accommodation is massive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen a significant increase—I think it's almost a doubling—in the number of international students coming to WA universities. Again, that puts even further pressure on our rural and regional students. I had a look in some universities' annual reports to see how they reported the numbers of regional and remote students in their list of students that they were supporting and representing and that were represented at their colleges, but there was no such figure in those annual reports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a real challenge. I know families in which two parents are working to try to keep one child at university. The rent alone is at least $30,000 a year for them. I've got families in which each parent has two jobs, and they've got a second child coming that really wants or needs to go to university in Perth as well. The family has no choice here; either the child can go to a university in Perth to study their preferred course or that course can't be done in our local university in the south-west. The family does absolutely everything it can. To the parents who are coming to see me: I have represented you on this issue repeatedly in this place, and I will continue to do so. I just make the House aware that this is a rising problem for students in the regions, and it wouldn't be just in my electorate; this is being felt right around Australia by those students who have no choice but to move to a city to study. With this massive increase in international students, the competition for accommodation and the lack of rentals are a massive issue for our regional students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The prac placement uncertainty is there as well, because there are a whole range of other, different courses where the students are forced to undergo placements with no support, whether that's speech pathology, GPs— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  I rise in support of the motion moved by the member for Holt. The Australian Universities Accord is the biggest and broadest review of the higher education sector in 15 years. It sets out a way forward to ensure we have a stronger, fairer economy and country, futureproofing our nation with the skills we need that are homegrown by our universities and TAFEs. As part of our response to the accord, the government has set a national target of 80 per cent of the workforce having a tertiary qualification by 2050. This approach is ambitious, but it will help to ensure that we build the skills we need for a future made in Australia, where no-one is held back and no-one is left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is providing cost-of-living relief to make higher education better and fairer for students, including those from low socioeconomic or disadvantaged backgrounds and those from the outer suburbs or regional Australia. This is important. I know it is often a challenge for students living in the outer suburbs of my electorate of Pearce to pursue a tertiary education. Younger people have not been forgotten in this budget, and we are cutting student debt for more than three million Australians and wiping around $3 billion in student debt. To do this, we are introducing HELP loan credits for people impacted by the recent inflation spike. We are making sure that, in the future, student debt never grows faster than wages or the ability to pay it off. The way indexation is calculated will be improved, making sure last year's indexation spike cannot happen again. From 1 July, these changes to student debt will help support nearly 18,000 persons with a HELP debt in Pearce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July next year, we are also delivering new financial support for students who undertake mandatory unpaid placements as part of their study, including in nursing, teaching, social work and midwifery. The Commonwealth prac payment will provide around 68,000 higher education students and approximately 7,200 VET students in WA with more than $300 per week while they are on mandatory placements as part of their degree. I know that these unpaid placements put real pressure on people. Too many students are forced to drop out of courses that they are passionate about, simply because they cannot afford to do their prac. We believe no-one should be held back from higher education because of the cost. We will deliver fee-free university-ready courses to provide more students with an enabling pathway into higher education. This is expected to increase the number of students undertaking these courses by 40 per cent in 2030, with double the number of students by 2040, and give more Australians the skills they need to get into the course they choose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the government will make needs based funding a core component of funding for higher education, teaching and learning. A new managed-growth funding system with fully funded places will be developed for Commonwealth supported places to meet student demand, maintain sustainable growth and increase opportunity for people from underrepresented backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to see the intention to improve tertiary harmonisation by supporting better student pathways between VET and higher education and by reducing red tape for dual-sector providers. I used to work in a school. I know that for some students the pathways to tertiary education can be a little intimidating, especially when choices are made as early as year 10, with some finding themselves locked into a course that is not ideal in terms of their long-term goals. It would make life so much easier to have more flexibility and recognition between sectors that support better student pathways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Should the broader accord targets be achieved, $240 billion will be added to the economy over the period to 2050. I also commend the Albanese Labor government for progress being made on all five priority actions from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Universities Accord interim report</span>. In particular, I also wish to highlight that the government has agreed to establish an independent national student ombudsman, establish a higher education code to prevent and respond to gender based violence, undertake a study into the prevalence and impact of racism across the university system, and guarantee funding for student led organisations. I reiterate my support of the motion moved by the hardworking member for Holt. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I were to try to describe my political beliefs in just one word, it would be 'localism'. It's the very simple idea that the wisdom of local people should be respected, that local people should have more control over what happens in their local areas and that local businesses should be supported and helped to prosper. Localism is our best opportunity in regional Australia to deliver the services and infrastructure our communities need. But, of course, under our centralised system of government, federal governments receive most of the revenue and then distribute it to the states and local government areas. Hopefully they'll do that fairly, hopefully with strategic national policies and targets in mind and hopefully with enough scope for innovation and flexibility on the ground in our local communities. But I say 'hopefully' because, in reality, that's not the situation under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The modern Labor Party is philosophically opposed to local economy and localism. With its 'Canberra knows best' attitude, this modern Labor Party has presided over decisions which have divided Australians, where the elites in the city don't trust regional people to make decisions that are in their own best interests. We've seen it with Labor's approach to slashing jobs in the native hardwood timber industry, the mining sector and live sheep exports and with ignorant plans to buy back water from the Murray-Darling Basin. This is command and control from people who don't want to actually live in our communities. They don't want to live with us; they just want to tell us how to live our lives, what jobs we can have and what we're allowed to build, and they want to intrude into our pastimes, like hunting or recreational fishing. This is the exact opposite of localism. We need to resist this Labor approach, which is in partnership with their mates, unfortunately, in the teals and the Australian Greens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In government, the Labor Party wants local councils to come begging to them, cap in hand, asking for more money and bidding under competitive grants programs which are fundamentally unfair and discriminatory to our smaller councils. Labor came to government promising fair increases in funding for local government. Before the 2022 federal election, the Labor Party promised fair increases to local government funding, but it has actually delivered cuts to several programs which our councils relied on. Even the Australian Local Government Association has acknowledged it's a broken promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the middle of the cost-of-living crisis, the burden is falling more on family budgets as ratepayers are forced to fund the cost-shifting and the widening gaps in demand for new infrastructure, maintenance and critical services in our local council areas. Labor has waged war on regional grants programs which our councils have relied on to deliver the infrastructure and services their communities need. We've seen programs abolished right across regional Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a wasted two years we've seen from those opposite. Not a single regional grants program has actually delivered any project in our regional communities, not even one. With no new funding for regional community infrastructure, the Albanese government has actually created an investment drought, because the pipeline of projects funded by the previous government is virtually complete. Just last month we saw the evidence of this, with the minister finally announcing the first projects under her much-trumpeted but yet to be delivered Growing Regions Program. The Growing Regions Program finally announced just $206 million, against applications which totalled $2.7 billion. It's a pittance after two years of doing absolutely nothing. The backlog in demand for funding is no surprise and has been growing every year because Labor has failed to deliver any funding for two financial years and has lived vicariously off the coalition's policy success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The greatest insult of all this hypocrisy is Labor ministers and senators turning up to cut the ribbons and unveil the plaques on projects that they had absolutely nothing to do with and that, in many cases, came from programs that had ceased to exist. They love our programs so much they turn up for the openings, they cut the ribbons, they unveil the plaques and then they cut the funding for the program going forward. Instead of parading around Australia, taking credit for projects they had nothing to do with and were funded by the previous government, perhaps the Albanese Labor government should be partnering with local councils to deliver new infrastructure projects in the communities in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be fair, perhaps I'm being a bit too critical. I need to be more optimistic. The member for Parkes will tell me that from time to time as well. Labor has delivered one outcome for local government, one huge achievement for local government, after two years. Labor has given local government an inquiry. After two years in government, Labor has launched an inquiry into the financial sustainability of local government—talk about kicking the can down the potholed road. Apparently the minister can't read the dozens of reports and submissions that have already been submitted to them by individual local councils and representative organisations over a period of years. The Albanese cabinet ministers have outsourced their jobs to a parliamentary committee with a pointless inquiry. It's time to start respecting local government and working in partnership to deliver the services and the critical infrastructure we need. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300126" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr REID</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  The federal Labor government understands that strong communities must have strong local governments, and that is why the Australian government is making significant investments into local governments right across Australia. My local government, the Central Coast Council, has received an increase in its funding thanks to the federal Labor government. The Central Coast region will benefit from the federal Labor government's increase to the Roads to Recovery Program, with Central Coast Council receiving $24.39 million over the next five years, which is $10.53 million more than it was forecast to receive under the previous Liberal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, we understand how important it is that local governments across the country, especially in regional and rural areas, have the resources to address local infrastructure needs. In my region, the No. 1 issue that is raised with me is local road infrastructure. While I am regularly doorknocking or calling into my community, people invariably discuss potholes, crumbling road infrastructure, lack of footpaths, kerb and guttering, and drainage. These deficiencies are a direct result of a decade of Liberal and National governments; exacerbating this matter was an ineffective former member for Roberston.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to have also secured $40 million for Central Coast Council under the Central Coast Roads Package. This funding is already helping council address local priority roads that require renewal. In total, 45 local Central Coast roads will receive road renewal works thanks to this pool of funding from the Commonwealth government. To date, Rickard Road in Empire Bay, a road that was crumbling apart under the formal Liberal government, has been churned up and resealed—a welcome relief for the community living along this road and for those motorists who frequent the suburb. Similarly, Scenic Road at MacMasters Beach, a road with atrocious conditions that were again ignored by the formal Liberal member, has now been churned and resealed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is not only helping local governments repair, renew and rebuild local roads; we are also helping provide the supporting community infrastructure that complements local roads like footpaths. In the 2024-25 federal budget, I was pleased to note that the department of infrastructure's new Active Transport Fund has been established. This $100 million program will help upgrade and deliver new bicycle and walking paths right across Australia. This will support zero emissions travel, provide a safer environment for cyclists and pedestrians and promote active and liveable communities. Safe and accessible active transport options like walking and cycling help boost social connection, help promote healthy choices and make our cities and regions a more vibrant place to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate I will be strongly advocating this to the Australian government, particularly for the residents of the peninsula, including the suburbs of Woy Woy, Umina Beach, Ettalong Beach, Booker Bay and Blackwall, who for too long have been overlooked by former governments when it comes to community infrastructure—likewise for Avoca Beach, where I'm continuing to support the local community's campaign to secure a shared pathway along Avoca Drive from the Scenic Highway roundabout to Heazlett Park. Already over 2,000 people have signed our petition calling for this shared pathway, with that figure continuing to grow daily.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal Labor government is also assisting Central Coast Council to renew and refurbish local sporting facilities right across the region. In particular, I am pleased that the Commonwealth government has provided the council with funding to renew the clubhouse at Frost Reserve in Kincumber. This is because the clubhouse is no longer fit for purpose and lacks the functionality required of a modern sporting facility.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2024-25 federal budget the government announced a range of cost-of-living measures for every Australian, which includes ratepayers right across this country, in local government areas like the Central Coast. From 1 July every Australian household will receive a $300 energy rebate to help with energy costs. This assistance also includes $325 rebates for eligible small businesses. From 1 July every Australian taxpayer will receive a tax cut. In Robertson, that represents 66,000 taxpayers who will receive a tax cut of an average of $1,580. Our tax cut will help deliver a bigger tax cut for Middle Australia to help with the cost of living. In my electorate 56,000 people, 85 per cent, will be better off under our tax cuts. The facts are there. The federal Labor government support our local governments whether they be in the bush, on the coast or in the city.</span>

I'm a little bit confused by the contribution of my colleague the member for Robertson just then, because a previous member for Robertson, who is now a senator for New South Wales, Senator O'Neill, came to my electorate a couple of weeks ago and said, 'We've stopped the rorts and the slush funds.' I thought: 'Good news! We don't like that.' Then I found out today that there's a Central Coast roads fund, for $40 million or something. With great respect to the member for Robertson, he could rollerskate across his electorate in a couple of hours. What is he going to do with all that money? It takes 13½ hours to drive across my electorate. There is no western New South Wales roads fund—oh, he's gone! That's the point exactly.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former mayor, I'm a great believer in the primacy of local government. There are about 536 local governments around Australia. I know that in my electorate there are 18 local government areas. We don't always agree on everything, but I certainly understand that those local councils are the primary representatives of those communities. The relationship that the previous government had with them through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program was one of the most effective I've seen in my time in parliament. They know what their communities need. They employ locally. Quite frankly, of all the federal funding that has gone into my electorate, the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is probably the best bang for buck for the Australian taxpayer.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you a good example. I have got a village by the name of Goodooga. Goodooga is near the Queensland border. It is predominantly an Aboriginal community. Brewarrina Shire is the council area. They are a very good, proactive council. Through the LRCI, they had upgraded the local bore baths. They employed local people. Tommy Lukas from Brewarrina and his team employed a lot of local Aboriginal folk in working on that. In conjunction with some road funding they achieved, there's now a sealed road going all the way to Goodooga, which they built themselves. There was also some other funding they got from the previous government for a new supermarket and a petrol station. Now one of the most iconic and beautiful parts of New South Wales has access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker Sharkie, I'm reminded of one of your trips north to go through there. It is a beautiful place, and there are up to 50 vans a night at those bore baths. That project wouldn't have been thought of in Canberra. That was something that the local people knew was needed. The local people were employed to build it and now the local people are getting the benefits of having those tourists come in. Their spending is helping keep the store viable. Otherwise, it might struggle with just a small community. That's a classic example. All over my electorate, those 18 council areas really worked closely with me and my office and got some great results.</span>

We had the sporting grants that went out but caught great derision from the other side.

To serve as a councillor is a great privilege. I have seen the positive outcomes that a good council can deliver for a community, especially when working constructively with state and federal governments. A local government often plays a leading and critical role in solving the issues most Australians are concerned about, whether it's local roads needing repair, inadequate housing supply, a lack of local parks or uncollected rubbish. These are the issues that are being felt now more than ever. We all hear about it. We all see it. In fact, my office regularly receives inquiries on the issues relating to local government, especially regarding local roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past decade, my community has seen continued neglect and deterioration of local infrastructure at the hands of successive coalition governments at state, federal and local levels. Our communities, which are amongst the fastest growing in our country, have been underfunded and neglected while successive coalition governments issued press-release projects that never materialised. As a result, we have suffered. Our growing communities don't have the adequate infrastructure they need to thrive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I've seen a dramatic shift since the election of the Albanese government in 2022 and the New South Wales Minns government in 2023. Finally, for the first time in a decade, our local communities are receiving some of their fair share. In the May 2024 budget, the Albanese government committed an additional $1.9 billion for Western Sydney road and rail infrastructure. This includes funding for 14 new projects and two existing projects. The budget includes $1 billion for enabling infrastructure for the Housing Support Program priority work stream, building on an already committed $500 million through the Housing Support Program. The budget also delivers substantial funding for Roads to Recovery and the Black Spot Program. Roads to Recovery funding will progressively increase from $500 million per year to $1 billion per year, doubling the amount of funding local councils will receive to maintain their local road infrastructure. The Black Spot Program will also increase from $110 million to $150 million per year, ensuring more funding to local councils for road safety upgrades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I had the pleasure of visiting several upgrades to local roads with the Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories, the Hon. Kristy McBain. These are upgrades that are only possible because of the Albanese government's increased investment in local government and upgrades that were long overdue and will benefit my community, such as the resurfacing of Hill Road in Lurnea and surface, gutter and kerb improvements along Gabo Crescent in Sadleir. Both projects were fully funded by the federal government under the Roads to Recovery Program, which will deliver $12.59 million to Liverpool City Council, a boost of $5.4 million thanks to the Albanese government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding for my community does not stop there. Under phase 4 of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, $2.25 million is being delivered to Liverpool City Council for local roads, building on the $10.5 million in untied financial assistance grant funding in this financial year, the $28 million in federal funding under the Local Roads Package and the $1.1 million for local road safety projects under the road Black Spot Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is making significant investments in local councils across Australia, because this government understands they are the best place to deliver for our communities. It is time for local councils, especially Liverpool City Council, to follow through and deliver on the projects that have already received substantial government funding. Our community deserves better than a mayor who has placed his own political survival and feuds ahead of the interests of locals. Residents are crying out for their roads to be fixed, yet Liverpool City Council are yet to spend the funding that's been allocated to them. Come September, I hope that we see a Liverpool City Council and councillors that are better able to represent the interests of our community and work constructively with state and federal governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local government is the engine room for change in our local communities, and the Albanese government is fuelling that engine. The most recent budget shows that this government is serious about working with local governments, and it is time for councils to use the federal money they have to improve local infrastructure.</span>

I thank the member for Gippsland for introducing it to the chamber today. Like the member for Gippsland, I understand the importance of local government in delivering important infrastructure and services across Australia, particularly in regional areas. So often, when we hear conversation about local government, the old RRR acronym gets thrown around—it's often used to disparage and lessen the role of local governments—'roads, rates and rubbish'. I can assure you—and Deputy Speaker Sharkie will no doubt agree with me—that local government in regional Australia are responsible for far more than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia, we have seen examples over the years of local governments going well and truly above and beyond for their communities, whether that's by incentivising GPs to operate in their community or trying to address the drastic housing shortages that now exist. They are in charge of not just the local library and the local pool but other very, very important community assets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just on housing, I regularly meet with local governments across Durack, and I've heard plenty of times about communities being let down by the WA state Labor government. I would like to suggest to the Albanese government that they consider looking to invest directly into local government, bypassing state governments altogether, as a potential solution for housing shortages—particularly across regional WA—because I believe local governments can be trusted with this very important role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are over 40 local government areas within my electorate of Durack. Some are home to tens of thousands of residents, like the City of Greater Geraldton, or just a few hundred, like the Shire of Cue. No matter the size of the local council, on this side of the House we know that it is local government that are most in tune with community needs, and that's why we trusted local government to deliver road projects and important community infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud of the support that we on this side offered to local government authorities across Australia. This included $21.7 billion through the Financial Assistance Grant program and $3 billion of support through the innovative Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, which was particularly important in keeping councils going through the pandemic. Another great aspect of this program was that the funding to the council wasn't tied and, therefore, it assisted local councils to be able to invest in that low-hanging fruit when they were unable to find other pots of money to pay for that. I've seen many good examples of that, right throughout Durack. We also delivered $6.2 billion through the Roads to Recovery Program, which supported the maintenance of the nation's local road infrastructure assets, facilitating greater accessibility and improving safety, economic and social outcomes for Australians. We provided a further $676 million in the Bridges Renewal Program to provide funding for upgrades to bridges that provide access for local communities and that facilitate vehicle access to enhance the local community, which is particularly important in those very, very remote parts of Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the last election the Labor Party promised fair increases to local government funding, yet all they have done is cut program after program that my councils have relied upon. The Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, which I previously mentioned, is just one of the many programs that has been abandoned by this Albanese Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another disgraceful example of Labor's disregard for the needs of regional Western Australia was clearly demonstrated through their recent announcement of the successful recipients of the Growing Regions Fund. Some 90 per cent of projects that were initially assessed as worthy by the regional development department were rejected. This includes several projects for my electorate of Durack. The Albanese government has confirmed that the program was underspent by $93.4 million or by 31 per cent—so there were clearly other projects they could have approved. If you ever needed an example of the Labor Party not supporting regional Australia, there it is right there, underspent by 31 per cent. This is a real slap in the face to regional communities and all of those really hardworking local governments who invested so much time and effort and—dare I say it—in some cases, financial resources to produce detailed business cases and quality applications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the Albanese government is taking councils for granted. The federal budget has been a miserable failure, and the work of councils to deliver liveable communities deserves more respect than they're receiving today.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  It's always amusing getting lectures from those opposite, who claimed before the 2013 election that they'd not cut any funding for regional roads or for health, education and a whole bunch of other areas. They said no cuts to the ABC. In the first budget of the Abbott government, they put a three-year indexation freeze on grants to local government which resulted in $925 million in grants to local government being cut. On top of that, I can vividly remember them allowing 30 June to pass so the Roads to Recovery funding didn't actually happen. They had to bring in legislation to get it done because they didn't even prioritise that particular funding, even though it was bipartisan and we supported the arrangement for the continuation of the Roads to Recovery funding. So after $925 million in funding cuts from those opposite to local councils, they come in here and give us lectures about supposed cuts to local councils. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are putting regional Australia at the centre of a prosperous and resilient future. There was a decade in which those opposite continued to deliver cuts and failed to support regional infrastructure. They prioritised their own National Party seats on various occasions through the structure of the way they did their regional funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that we've increased funding to local councils for critical local infrastructure. Not only did the coalition fail to do that; they actually cut the funding. It's an absolute fact that they cut funding back when they were in government. We're delivering record funding for local infrastructure to councils and billions of dollars towards transport and road safety. We're making local roads safer with $4.4 billion under the Roads to Recovery Program, and we've committed to progressively double the program to $1 billion annually, something the coalition never did when they were in government. We delivered that in the 2024-25 budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this funding boost, local governments in every state and territory will receive additional resources, something that seems to be absent in the understanding of the member for Gippsland. His own home state of Victoria will receive $895 million over five years, an increase of $368 million. My home state of Queensland will receive a similar amount over five years, an increase of $353 million. In my own electorate, investment in Roads to Recovery funding for council will be a massive $132.2 million dollars. This means every single council in Australia will receive more funding for local road infrastructure under this Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Black Spot Program will also rise substantially, from $110 million to $150 million per year—something the member for Gippsland seems to have forgotten as well, even though it's in the budget papers—meaning more money is available for improving some of the most dangerous sections of our roads, and intersections as well. The new Safer Local Roads and Infrastructure Program has $200 million available per year—$50 million more than was in the two programs that it replaced. Again, this is something the member for Gippsland seems to have forgotten.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are we delivering more funding for local infrastructure; the government has returned integrity to grant programs following the shameful record of those opposite. We're delivering community infrastructure that benefits communities across the country, over boondoggles and pork-barrelling. For the first time, under this government, all communities, regardless of where they are, will have access to open, transparent and competitive community infrastructure grants programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early on we committed an extra $250 million to phase 4 of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program to improve the safety of local roads across the country. In fact, Ipswich City Council and Somerset Regional Council in my electorate received more than $5 million collectively in phase 4 of the program, much of which was used to fix roads damaged in the 2022 floods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, under this program, the financial assistance grants to local government have actually increased and will increase in each and every budget. There was $2.8 billion in 2022-23, and there will be $3.2 billion in 2023-24 and $3.27 billion in 2024-25. In contrast, from 2014 to 2017 the coalition, as I said, froze indexation, which led to a loss of what was initially thought to be $925 million but got upwards, in retrospect, of close to $1 billion. We've acknowledged the changing services and demands on councils. We're committed to providing fair and appropriate funding to support them and the essential work they do. I urge the member for Gippsland to actually read the budget papers and not the National Party talking points. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  I thank the member for Gippsland for this motion. Like him, I recognise the important role local government plays in rural and regional electorates like ours. Councils aren't just responsible for roads, rates and rubbish. They provide so many more vital services to communities: health and aged-care services, transport, libraries, pools and parks. I'm pleased that the Standing Committee on Regional Development Infrastructure and Transport, which I'm a member of, is currently undertaking an inquiry into local government sustainability. This will help us understand the challenges local governments face in providing community services and explore the ways that we as a Commonwealth can better support them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Challenges faced by regional, rural or remote councils in particular stem from the fact that they have fewer ratepayers than metropolitan councils. Despite this, they often have just as many, if not more, services and assets to provide and maintain for their populations. Rural and remote councils, for example, look after thousands more kilometres of road. In my electorate, Indigo Shire has 1,500 kilometres of road. The rural city of Wangaratta maintains 2,000 kilometres of road network. On top of this, after recent flooding events rural roads are eroding before our very eyes. Councils are struggling to find the funds to repair them, let alone build them back better to withstand future natural disasters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month I met with the managers of the Breakaway Twin Rivers Caravan Park in Acheron, on the banks of the Goulburn River, where the community is still waiting for the Breakaway Bridge to be replaced following significant flooding in October 2022. It's no mistake that this bridge has this name. The community desperately need their bridge replaced, but limited federal funding prevents the council from building back better and decreasing the likelihood of the bridge being swept away in the future. There are many bridges like Breakaway Bridge across rural Australia where councils need more federal assistance to build back with greater resilience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I was pleased to see some additional help for councils through the increased funding for the Roads to Recovery Program under the budget. This will now rise from $500 million to $1 billion per year. This funding directly impacts the quality of our local roads, allowing potholes to be filled and repaired and culverts to be installed so we can all get home safely. This new funding for roads is welcome, but, like the member for Gippsland, I can't see much more in the budget for local governments in regional and rural areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I was disappointed not to see more funding for the government's signature Growing Regions Program and for the Regional Partnerships and Precincts Program. These programs are some of the only government policies truly dedicated to regional development. Local governments in my electorate applied for these programs to fund projects for recreation facilities, art galleries and community hubs, to name but some. I want to see these applicants succeed because I want to see regional communities succeed, and I know many other members in this House do too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been asked many times, actually, whether advocating for these projects in my electorate is pork-barrelling. Pork-barrelling is a practice in politics and in the allocation of grants that I want to see end, but, in a fair system with good rules, guidelines and processes, the best projects are funded not because of who advocate the loudest but because they have merit and address community need. In a fair and robust system, members of this place could advocate loudly for projects in their electorates, knowing that the rules would still ensure a fair process, irrespective of whether they're in a marginal electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Growing Regions Program and the RPPP have clear guidelines and selection criteria and robust processes, and I congratulate the government on that. The biggest problem, though, with these programs is they aren't big enough to respond to the need. Applications to the Growing Regions Program totalled more than $1.7 billion, and we also know, from Senate estimates, that 311 projects were deemed suitable for funding, with the total amount applied for under those projects at $1.4 billion. This program has only $600 million to distribute over two rounds of $300 million. Under the first round, the government funded just $207 million, which is less than what the budget allocated. As we can see, it's a fraction of what the department deemed suitable for funding. It leaves $93 million unspent in a program that is clearly oversubscribed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't understand this. There is a clear demand from local councils for more federal financial assistance. I urge the government to add more money to the Growing Regions Program and the Regional Precincts and Partnerships Program to help our councils better deliver their infrastructure. I urge them: spend the $93 million that's still there.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  The Albanese government already has a proud record on local government spending, some of which I will cover in the time allowed. But this motion is a cynical one. The member for Gippsland knows this nation's capital is about to be descended upon by 700 or more worthy local government representatives, including those from the cities of Swan and Kalamunda and the Shire of Mundaring, in Hasluck. He wants to pretend that the coalition is the best friend of local government, and nothing could be further from the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 2014 to 2017, the coalition froze the indexation of the Financial Assistance Grants program. Local councils fell behind then and have been borrowing from Peter to pay Paul ever since. It is in the light of the long-term effects of those coalition cuts that the minister has asked the parliament to review the financial sustainability of local governments. The Standing Committee on Regional Development, Infrastructure and Transport, chaired by my friend the member for Solomon, will examine local government sustainability. The terms of reference for that inquiry include financial sustainability and funding; the changing infrastructure and service delivery obligations; structural impediments to security for local government workers, infrastructure and service delivery; trends in the attraction and retention of a skilled workforce; and impacts of labour hire practices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a comprehensive review, yet a few weeks ago the member for Gippsland called it cynical. And that's coming from a National Party and coalition that failed to act on the financial sustainability of councils, that ignored the need for fair and transparent processes in grant allocation and that froze indexation, taking millions out of council coffers. I've been here long enough to see what happened to inquiry reports under the coalition. They just sat there without even the courtesy of a government response. Do you know what our inquiries are often followed by? Legislation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Gippsland talked about roads with potholes, just prior to this year's budget. Labor has increased local government road infrastructure funding. We're increasing the Roads to Recovery funding to $1 billion per year by 2027-28 and the Black Spot Program by $50 million per year to $150 million. Every local council in Australia will receive more funding for local road infrastructure under Labor—that's more for potholes too. The member for Gippsland is happy to move a well-timed motion, but, really, he should be on his feet explaining why the coalition weren't planning these increases when it was under their watch and why they froze the funding indexation for years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new Safer Local Roads and Infrastructure Program also involves $50 million more funding than previous programs. Our financial assistance grants to local governments have increased in each budget under this government. This was $2.8 billion in 2022-23, $3.1 billion in 2023-24 and $3.27 billion in 2024-25. Our transparent grant programs include the $600 million Growing Regions Program, $400 million for the Regional Precincts and Partnership Program, $200 million for the Thriving Suburbs Program and $150 million for the Urban Precincts and Partnerships Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Hasluck we have vital local councils doing excellent work. Last week I met with the Shire of Mundaring and heard from them about their exciting plans for the rejuvenation of the Mundaring town site. The week prior I met with the City of Swan to discuss proposals for the Ellenbrook Community Hub, Ellenbrook Leisure Centre and the redevelopment of the Ellenbrook district open spaces, as well as a host of other issues. Ellenbrook is the centre of one of the fastest-growing corridors in the country, and the council are hopeful that their worthy application for one of the government's suburban university study hubs will also be successful, as am I.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When local governments and others apply for government grants and consideration under the host of programs available, some of which I've mentioned, they can do so knowing that their application will be considered fairly and with the proper application of due process. One of the reasons the former coalition government was so on the nose with voters was that they failed to ensure that government money was spent fairly. After a while, the voters noticed the rorts and the inequities that flowed from those practices. But constituents in Gippsland and Hasluck and their local governments can now apply for funds knowing that the system is fair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the member shouldn't bring motions pretending that the coalition have a good record in this area. The government has increased funding across the many programs administered at a local government level. Moreover, we've brought the measure of probity to the process, which was unknown to those opposite when they were in office.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  I certainly agree with the motion and commend the member for Gippsland for bringing it to the chamber. Indeed, the member for Hasluck talks about probity. I would ask the member: which of those projects that were in my electorate would Labor have struck out? I will go through them, because all politics is local. Federal funding for main street upgrades in Cootamundra, Cowra, Forbes, Grenfell, Gundagai and Parkes has made such a difference to those local communities. Perhaps Labor would want to see the $9 million to enhance water security in Bland Shire taken out. Perhaps it might be the million dollars to Coolamon Shire through the Drought Communities Program to upgrade such things as the Redgrave Park Tennis Club, or upgrades to the Marrar Gymkhana Reserve, or improvements to the Ardlethan and Ganmain showgrounds. Maybe it might be the $149,000 for a site upgrade at the Cootamundra Heritage Centre. Possibly the $307,000 to upgrade the roofs at the cultural centre and the bonsai house at the Cowra Japanese Garden and Cultural Centre.</span>

                  </a>  I didn't interrupt you. Don't you interrupt me. Possibly the $1½ million for the expansion of the Central West Livestock Exchange at Forbes, the second-largest sheep yards in the world according to the deputy mayor, Councillor Chris Roylance, just the other day when I was speaking to him. Possibly the $950,000 for the Grenfell medical centre in Weddin Shire, which needs to find a doctor for Grenfell. It certainly makes a difference. Possibly $3½ million for a new sewage treatment works in Gundagai.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Would Labor take away the $2½ million to upgrade the Cunningar grain storage and handling facility in the Hilltops LGA? Perhaps the million dollars to Junee for the Drought Communities Program to upgrade community projects such as the Sandy Beach at Wantabadgery or the Bethungra Dam tourist reserves. Or might it be the $200,000 for the Lockhart Community Hub and Conference Centre. Perhaps it might be the $1½ million for the extension of the Parkes Airport Business Park. Maybe the $5.3 million to upgrade the Temora Aerodrome runway and associated main apron and taxiways, which the RAAF described prior to the funding as being quite dangerous. Maybe it would be the $4.4 million to build a multipurpose stadium at the Equex Centre at Wagga Wagga. All were good, worthy and tremendous projects for my electorate. But that was replicated right throughout the nation—indeed, in your electorate, Deputy Speaker Sharkie, and all of those great regional electorates.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Indi belled the cat when she said that these programs were oversubscribed. Yes, they truly were. Many of those programs, I can remember as the minister in charge of making sure distribution was fair and equitable, were oversubscribed six times over. We could have had so many more projects funded, but, of course, the Independents never quite realise that the pie is only so big and you can cut the pie only so much; you run out of money. So they are based—or certainly were under the coalition government—on a system which was equitable and which members got a say in. I do take umbrage at the fact that Labor members come in here and say there was no probity or no transparency, because there was.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we can't have—what we certainly should not ever subscribe to—is a condition in which the public servants, as good as they are, get to determine where all the money is going to be spent, because at the end of the day that should be the minister's prerogative. At the end of the day, under the Westminster system—and, if the minister is doing the wrong thing, if the minister is shown to be rorting et cetera, the minister will face the ire of not only the Westminster system which we operate under but certainly the ballot box next time around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are proud of our record, and I am certainly proud of what we did as a government for regional Australia, for regional progress. I know the Local Roads and Committee Infrastructure Fund, which distributed $54.8 million to the councils in my electorate, was money well spent. I know that, right across the nation, that LRCI funding, the Drought Communities funding, the Building Better Regions Fund—all of those programs were so well received by the councils, and the councils did very well to the point where the Bland Shire mayor, Brian Monaghan, at West Wyalong, said the only problem was finding the number of workers to build the projects. In his words, it was record spending. He very much appreciated it, and that was under a coalition government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  I rise to speak to this motion to strengthen Medicare moved by my good friend and colleague the member for Macarthur. Labor has a proud record on health. Forty years ago the Whitlam Labor government established Medicare, the universal health insurance scheme that continues to serve millions of Australians in need. But Medicare's introduction and, indeed, its survival has been anything but smooth sailing, because coalition governments have had a long history of hostility to Medicare. Today the Albanese Labor government is building on Whitlam's legacy as we strengthen Medicare for all Australians. Indeed, one of the first acts of this government was to restore the much-loved GP access after-hours service in the Newcastle and Hunter region, reinstating in full the operational hours of all clinics and reopening the after-hours service at the Calvary Mater hospital, which closed under the Morrison government's watch. Now thousands more Australians can soon access free urgent care when they need to, through the additional 29 urgent care clinics we announced in the recent budget, bringing the total number across Australia to 87. That's 87 urgent care clinics offering free walk-in care seven days a week over extended hours, completely bulk-billed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to recently host the Minister for Health and Aged Care in Newcastle to announce an urgent care clinic that will be established to service the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie area. This is great news for Novocastrians. It will help take the pressure off the John Hunter Hospital, where around 40 per cent of visitations are what we call categories 4 and 5—that is, patients with non-life-threatening conditions who are turning up to emergency departments when they would be better suited being treated in primary health. I've been fighting for an urgent care clinic in Newcastle and I am pleased to say this government is now delivering. It will go a long way to helping my community access quality, bulk-billed primary health care when they need it. The only card you need at an urgent care clinic is your Medicare card.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of cuts and neglect from the opposition, Labor's investments in Medicare and our health system are reversing the damage done—and more. The centrepiece of the Albanese Labor government's 2023-24 budget was a historic $6.1 billion investment in strengthening Medicare. This included a $3.5 billion investment to triple the bulk-billing incentives for GPs, benefiting more than 11 million people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also expanding the range of free mental health services through a commitment of $361 million over four years, including a network of 61 walk-in Medicare mental health centres that are fully staffed with professionals to care for people at every stage of mental health distress. We're investing $69.8 million to provide more MRI machines that are Medicare eligible—from 227 machines to 620. We're funding Medicare rebates for nuclear imaging and other common medical tests, enabling more people to access critical and timely diagnostic testing without having to worry about the cost. This will quite literally save lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it doesn't stop there. We're also easing cost-of-living pressures for households through a $4.3 billion investment to deliver cheaper medicines. The maximum cost of PBS medicines has been reduced to $31.60, and 60-day prescriptions have been introduced for 184 common medicines, which is saving millions of Australians time and money, while caring for their health. In my electorate of Newcastle alone, 203,432 cheaper prescriptions have been issued since we've introduced this initiative, resulting in over $2.3 million in savings for Novocastrians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We still have more to do to undo the previous decade of damage done by the opposition to Medicare and our primary health system, but Labor has a long history of caring for Australians, and this Albanese Labor government is no exception. Only Labor can be trusted to invest in and support Medicare, which is, after all, a Labor government's legacy. It is the most pressing issue for people in Newcastle and the Hunter region, and I really want to thank the minister for health for listening to our concerns. I come from an area where bulk-billing rates plummeted to a record low on the former government's watch. I'm doing absolutely everything I can to stop that downward spiral and turn this around. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  Surprise, surprise, I agree with the member for Newcastle when she says that health is the most pressing issue, because it is. Of course it ties in with the cost-of-living crisis too. But, if Labor were so good with Medicare and health in general, why have bulk-billing rates slipped and fallen so markedly since they took office in May 2022? Why is a town such as Parkes in central western New South Wales, in the Riverina electorate, not able to have maternity services in the hospital, such that there has not been a baby born there—according to Mayor Neil Wescott—for five years? For a town of that size, it's simply unacceptable. I agree with the member for Newcastle that health is and should always be the No. 1 priority. As Councillor Wescott observed, 'How do we as a town and shire attract doctors when we don't have the services available here to deliver babies?' It's so, so true. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm still shattered by the fact that when Labor came to office it changed the distribution priority areas for general practitioners to include some outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, as well as Newcastle, Wollongong, the Gold Coast and other major cities. You cannot tell me and you cannot convince country people that those areas I just mentioned have the same priority as towns like Parkes and others in more remote Australia. Distribution priority areas identify areas where people don't have enough access to doctors, based on the needs of the community. There are so many regional centres that fall into that category, yet Labor seems to think that it should include outer suburbs of our two major capital cities. It is simply not good enough, because why would you, having just graduated as a doctor, want to go out to some of those more remote areas of Australia when you can put your shingle up in one of those major capitals centres or, indeed, the Gold Coast? It is difficult enough for rural and regional areas, let alone remote areas, to not only attract but also retain doctors to work in hospitals as well as to have their own clinics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's decision has drawn the ire of health authorities. They see the move as a deterrent to doctors going to places where they are most needed, such as Parkes. The chief executive officer of the Rural Doctors Association said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We're already seeing the withdrawal of applications and a reduced number of overseas trained doctor applicants. … It's having an immediate impact. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">She went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We've seen adverts of corporate practices where they're saying, "If you've got a provider number with restrictions on it, you can now work in Hobart, or Canberra, unrestricted" …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the president of the RDA, Dr Megan Belot, said: 'No sooner was Labor's change announced than metropolitan medical clinics went after country doctors.' They 'went after country doctors'—so they headhunted them. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There has been a long-standing policy that required OTDs, who want to live and work in Australia, to spend time caring for rural and remote communities (classified MMM3-7) before receiving an unrestricted Medicare provider number.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Labor has scrapped this requirement by adding all large regional centres (MMM2) and some outer metro areas (MMM1) to the Distribution Priority Area (DPA) classification.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's simply not good enough. She said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As quickly as it was announced, city medical practices started targeting doctors in rural areas to move to cities including Canberra, Hobart, Sunshine Coast and Wollongong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray-Darling Medical Schools Network, I know, is going to make a difference, and I'm so pleased, as it's one of the legacies of my time as Deputy Prime Minister. It will make sure that doctors are able to do their full amount of training in a country setting. Whether that's at Dubbo or Wagga Wagga or Orange or Mildura or even Bendigo, it's going to make such a difference, because they will go to those country areas, if they are not there already. They will stay in those country areas when they get their diploma or their certificate, because they'll fall in love with the area. They'll see there's money to be made in the area. Maybe they might fall in love with somebody in the area, and that will keep them there. But rest assured: it is a good initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that, at Wagga Wagga, the UNSW is making great strides in making the young graduates very welcome. They're going to be doing all of their training in that setting, in the new multistorey building, right next door to Wagga Wagga Base Hospital, where they can do their prac. It's a good outcome.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  I'd like to thank the honourable member for Macarthur for bringing this motion to the House. I welcome any opportunity to talk about that proud Australian and Labor institution that is Medicare. It's universal caring—something that is actually in my DNA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare celebrated its 40th birthday on 1 February this year, and doesn't it look good. Thanks to the Hawke Labor government and the vision of Gough Whitlam before that, Australians have had access to high-quality universal health care ever since. There have been a few hiccups, obviously, but Medicare guarantees every Australian access to a wide range of health and hospital services at low or no cost, because all Australians make a contribution. In the last financial year alone, over 26.5 million Medicare customers put in close to 460 million claims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we know that Medicare is certainly going strong—and I say this proudly—in spite of the efforts of successive coalition governments to weaken it. We all remember Malcolm Fraser and John Howard having a crack at Medibank and Medicare. That was followed by further attacks during the dismal Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison wandering wilderness years. The now Leader of the Opposition, in his time as the Minister for Health, froze the Medicare rebate, which has meant a substantial decline in the number of GPs that are bulk-billing—something that, as our health minister says, is the beating heart of our health system. I remember that he also tried to establish the GP tax; he tried adding $5 to the cost of every script; and he ripped up the National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services, denying that crucial plank in the health system $200 million. The member for Dickson also cut $50 billion from public hospitals. He even abolished Health Workforce Australia, leaving the nation exposed to medical workforce shortages—something that nearly every previous speaker on this motion has spoken about. I understand the member for Riverina saying that the country is having problems. Even the city is having trouble recruiting doctors at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In opposition, the member for Dickson led the blocking of legislation for 60-day prescriptions. He just said no. Cheaper prescriptions have saved Australians more than $370 million since January last year. It's good for people organising their lives, and it helps us contain inflation, obviously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has Medicare's back, and we're committed to strengthening it even further. We're investing nearly $3 billion in this year's budget on a range of crucial measures, such as funding a further 29 urgent care clinics across the nation—bringing the total to 87. I recently had the pleasure of visiting the urgent care clinic service in Brisbane's southside, and I heard firsthand from the staff there how they're taking the pressure off the nearby emergency departments and making it easier for people to see a doctor or nurse—all bulk-billed, of course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of bulk-billing, the tripling of the bulk-billing incentive in November 2023 has enabled an additional 950,000 bulk-billed trips to the GP. As the Minister for Health and Aged Care has said, bulk-billing is the beating heart of Medicare, and, at a time of cost-of-living pressures, bulk-billing means that going to the doctor does not impact on the family budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands that mental health supports are vital, which is why we are investing $360 million over four years to expand the free services available. These include a new national early-intervention service, as well as funding Primary Health Networks to employ skilled mental health staff to support patients with complex needs. We're also providing free direct help through psychiatrists and psychologists at 61 Medicare mental health centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is also implementing targeted support to women suffering from pelvic pain and endometriosis. From July next year, the Medicare Benefits Schedule will have two new items, to enable extended consults of 45 minutes and increased rebates. This $49 million investment will support approximately 430,000 more services to women across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Strengthening Medicare also directly helps Australians with cost-of-living pressures. Labor has already made medicines cheaper with the 60-day prescriptions, and we have now frozen the maximum cost of a PBS medicine to $31.60—a reduction of 29 per cent. Pensioners and concession card holders will pay a maximum of $7.70. All of this is part of making sure that we've got health professionals who can work with all of the challenges of Australia. You can trust only a Labor government to continue investing in and strengthening Medicare.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="295676" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  Access to affordable medical care is one of the most important qualities that we have as Australians. Our general practitioners are at the forefront of this. They play a critical role, from early detection of diseases and intervention, to guiding patients and their families through difficult medical conversations, through a lifetime of immunisations and check-ups and management of the aging process. In my community in Fowler, the work of GPs is more challenging, with language and cultural needs, as well as cultural beliefs. Over 70,000 people in my community live with a long-term health condition, from stroke to diabetes, arthritis, asthma and cancer—to name just a few.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is against the increasingly diverse needs in the community that many GPs find themselves working, and it's a particularly challenging job for many, as they are the primary caregiver to their patients and they're the gateway to other specialists, through their referral role. They take on a lot of responsibility for the professional diagnosis and treatment, and they are integral to the administrative processes that ensure continuity and follow-through in patient care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many things in our society post COVID, the healthcare sector has faced, and continues to face, many challenges. The shortage of GPs, especially GPs who offer bulk-billing services, is a critical one. This is not merely an inconvenience. It is a symptom of a deeper malaise in our healthcare system—a shortage in the supply of GPs that is fast becoming a crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently met with the CEO of the Minett Group of Companies, who represent numerous smaller GP practices. She informed me that, in the past year and a half, at least 30 GP practices have closed in the south-west Sydney area alone. Of the practices that remain, many are facing an aging profile of practitioners who are nearing retirement. This is not a temporary shortfall; it is a chronic and worsening shortage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To address this, we must look at increasing the supply of qualified GPs, especially those incentivised to bulk-bill. While we take comfort in the rigorous process that produces highly qualified doctors, we must also acknowledge that there are qualified medical graduates among us, trained overseas, who are waiting for their qualifications to be recognised so that they can contribute and fill the gap that our health system is experiencing. Surely our Australian medical health system can find solutions to bring on these overseas trained and qualified doctors by assessing factors such as the costly exams, the requirement to spend 10 years living in rural regions or the supervision requirements that seem overly bureaucratic and onerous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Fowler, with its high migrant and refugee population, there are doctors who could be serving our community's need for GPs. While I understand the necessity for English language proficiency and a review of the courses of study passed, surely we can streamline this process. These doctors are much more likely to seek to open practices and stay in communities where they, their families and their friends live. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another means to increase the supply of GPs would be to review professional qualification process that awards specialism. The decline in medical graduates choosing general practice, from 65 per cent to just 12 per cent, is alarming. The four- to five-year additional training period required to specialise as a GP is the same time commitment as other specialisations that offer much higher remuneration. It is incumbent upon medical associations, with input from government, to reassess this process and align it with the healthcare needs across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The socioeconomic disadvantage prevalent in south-west Sydney makes the area less attractive for new GPs due to a preference for bulk-billing, exacerbated by the inadequate indexing of patient rebates. This indexing requires urgent review to ensure that areas with the poorest health outcomes can support more bulk-billing practices. South-west Sydney has and will experience great population growth in the coming years. This will require a significant increase not only in GPs but also in nurses, allied health professionals and specialists to support the multidisciplinary teams.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need changes to incentivise existing GPs to bulk-bill patients. The current cost-of-living crisis, stagnating economy and wallet-emptying inflation overseen by this Labor government mean that many Australians will place food, clothing and fuel costs over their health. This is a false economy as delayed health checks lead to worse health outcomes and higher costs in the long term. I'm committed to engaging with the minister for health on these concerns and working towards a sustainable solution to ensure the health and wellbeing of our nation.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  I, together with the member for Moreton, am currently wearing a continuous glucose monitor because he, as chair of the Parliamentary Friends for the Prevention of Diabetes—or 'enemies of diabetes', perhaps, is more accurate—together with Diabetes Australia reckon it's a good idea for politicians to actually understand what people with diabetes have to live with, and they're right. I'm proud that, in July 2022, this government provided all 130,000 Australians with type 1 diabetes access to subsidised continuous glucose monitoring, such as the one I'm wearing on my arm today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will go to the election next year with good news to tell in the health portfolio, and central to that is the way in which we have begun the long task of strengthening Medicare after years of coalition neglect. The coalition were forever lukewarm at best on Medicare—when they were not actively undermining it, that is. The Australian people remind them from time to time that they better not mess with it. Medicare remains a beloved legacy program based on the premise that your access to primary health care shouldn't depend on the size of your wallet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor introduced Medibank in 1974 and was met with vehement opposition from the conservative parties. Just how much opposition? Well, a double dissolution and joint sitting's worth of opposition. Nevertheless, it got through. Then, after 1975, the scheme was white-anted and then abolished by the Fraser government. In 1984, Medicare was introduced—again with opposition from the conservatives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years, we have seen coalition leaders like Howard and Abbott talk about getting rid of Medicare, then recanting when they see it's too popular and then pretending to be Medicare's best friend. 'We won't get rid of any Medicare locals,' said Tony Abbott in opposition in 2013. All 61 were scrapped as soon as he came to office. The coalition doesn't oppose universal health care directly anymore, because they understand the electorate won't stand for that. Instead, they just let it run down. Once it has run down enough, they'll try to point to it as a failed system. It's the old coalition privatisation playbook.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Hasluck voted for Medicare at the last election. They voted for a Medicare urgent care clinic in Midland, and now one has been delivered and is operating extended hours at North Street Medical Centre, located close to the town centre of Midland. People needing care for themselves or their children can attend and have the whole of their urgent treatment bulk-billed. The government promised 50 Medicare urgent care clinics at the last election, and we've already delivered 58. In this year's budget, we have committed to creating another 29, with $227 million of funding to bring the total number to 87. Australians are appreciative of this new service, with over 400,000 presentations to urgent care clinics already. More than 25 per cent of those presentations were children under 15 years of age, and more than a third were outside of regular hours. Half of them say that they would otherwise have presented to the emergency department at the hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also pushing for a second urgent care clinic to be established in Hasluck. Ellenbrook township is the centre of what is possibly the fastest growing urban corridor in the country, and it remains underserviced in many ways. There is no hospital based there yet, and there is a great need for more and more varied health provision. An urgent care clinic will bridge the gap for many of our local residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year's budget included a $3.5 billion investment to triple the bulk-billing incentive to benefit more than 11 million Australians. As a result, the GP bulk-billing rate has risen by 2.1 per cent in the first five months of that policy. This translates to an extra 950,000 visits to the doctor. We can add to this—cheaper medicines, by virtue of the caps on scripts and the transition to 60-day scripts for many chronic conditions. The coalition were advised to allow 60-day scripts back in 2018, but they squibbed it, meaning that millions of Australians have paid too much for far too long, waiting for a government that cared enough to see that job done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These policies underpinning the health of the Medicare system, making medicines cheaper and increasing bulk-billing rates are obviously good for people's hip pockets too. At a time when cost of living is an issue, the government actions in the health portfolio serve to act as a brake on inflation and to help out with the family budget. Labor's investments in Medicare are good for the health of Hasluck and good for the country at large. I thank the member for Macarthur for this motion, recognising his unrelenting advocacy for Medicare and across the gamut of the health portfolio. Anyone wearing this or with any other condition can trust that Labor has their back and their health in mind.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  If you wanted to know about the state of your car, you'd ask a mechanic. If you wanted to know about the state of education, you'd ask a teacher. And, if you wanted to know about the state of the health system, you'd ask a doctor or a nurse. So thank you to the member for Macarthur, a doctor, for pointing out the incredible work that our government is doing in support of Australia's health system. We are making strides after just two years in government after 10 years of Liberal government neglect. Under the opposition leader as health minister—who, by the way, was voted by doctors as the worst health minister in 40 years—the Liberals cut $50 billion from hospitals, tried to burden Australians with a $7 GP tax and launched an outrageous sneak attack on accessible health care with the Medicare privatisation taskforce. You don't create a Medicare privatisation taskforce unless you're planning to privatise Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor campaigned in 2022 on strengthening Medicare and making medicines cheaper. That's what Australians voted for, and, since our election, that's what we've been delivering. In 2022, the Albanese Labor government delivered the biggest price cut in the entire history of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. No Australian pays more than $31.60 for their PBS medicine. In just over a single year, that translates to a saving of $370 million across 29 million prescriptions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2023, the Albanese Labor government introduced 60-day prescriptions across 184 medicines. You may have seen some campaigning on that issue. That decision came from listening to expert advice. The coalition heard the same advice over their 10 years in government, but, to nobody's surprise, they ignored it. In fact, they ignored it on six separate occasions when they blocked cheaper medicines for Australians in the Senate. In this year's budget the Albanese Labor government unlocked $4.3 billion to deliver even cheaper medicine. We're adding more medicines to the PBS and we're capping their cost, but we're not stopping there. Our bulk-billing incentives have seen bulk-billing in my electorate alone rise by five per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the Albanese Labor government introduced Medicare urgent care clinics back in 2022, over the objection of the Liberals. Medicare UCCs are open seven days a week. They accept walk-in patients without an appointment. The care they provide is fully bulk-billed and takes the pressure off emergency hospital departments and working families. More than 58 urgent care clinics have already seen more than 425,000 patients—fully bulk-billed. The health minister and I visited one of the clinics in Hobart last month. The operators said that around 80 per cent of their patients would otherwise have had to go to the Royal Hobart Hospital's emergency department if the clinic weren't there. The minister and I visited the Launceston clinic in your electorate of Bass, Deputy Speaker Archer, where we were told just three per cent of patients require referral onto hospital or more specialised care, proving that the Medicare urgent care clinics are doing exactly the job that we designed them to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to say the suburb of Bridgewater, in my electorate, will be home to Tasmania's fifth urgent care clinic. It supports not just Bridgewater; it provides necessary care to Brighton, Derwent Valley and Hobart's northern suburbs. The Liberals in Tasmania scoffed at our Medicare urgent care clinics back in 2022 when they were announced. They were called disasters and cruel hoaxes that couldn't be delivered. The social media posts are still up. You should never attribute malice to that which can be attributed to idiocy: two years later the Tasmanian Liberals think the Medicare urgent care clinics are such a disaster and such a cruel hoax that they don't want five in Tasmania—they say they want at least nine. We know the Liberals love saying no, but now it's nine. The Liberal Deputy Premier reckons we're dudding Tasmania by providing just five and not nine Medicare UCCs. You can't make it up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have a long and chequered history on Medicare, which the member for Hasluck has alluded to. Firstly, they wanted to abolish it. When they couldn't do that, they tried to gut it. Then they wanted to privatise it, and for 10 years they starved it. This Labor government lives, bleeds and breathes Medicare. We believe in Medicare. Only Labor will stand up for Medicare.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the early 1990s, the number of babies born before arrival has increased by 50 per cent nationally and doubled in Queensland, alarmingly. Over half of rural maternity services, or more than 130, including in Maryborough in Wide Bay, have closed during the same period. These closures disproportionately impact smaller services, putting much longer distances between maternity services. Despite the 'bigger means better' safety mantra, smaller, much-needed rural maternity services, where they are available, have proven to be as safe as large facilities in metropolitan areas. There is little evidence that maternity service closures are entirely a result of workforce shortages, but once they close it's rare and more difficult for them to reopen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The closure of rural maternity units puts greater financial burden and psychological stress onto families. These families are hit by higher travel and accommodation costs. They are forced to leave their local support systems and their employment, and their other children are forced to leave school at a critical time. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, rural babies are more likely to be born prematurely, facing lifelong health challenges. But the most tragic consequence is the one we can't ignore: more rural and remote mothers and babies don't come home at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our nation's rural families are the lifeblood of our country and our economy. However, despite contributing so much to our economy, for them there's little in return in the way of health care and maternity services. A recent report by Nous Group's health and ageing practice found that there was a $6.55 billion shortfall in healthcare funding between rural and urban Australians. Disappearing local maternity care exacerbates the rural-urban health gap. Rural Australians begin experiencing health disadvantage before they're even born. Despite shrinking levels of maternity services, endorsed midwife numbers have increased across rural and regional Australia, and they continue to fill in gaps for rural families by providing much-needed antenatal, birth and postpartum care, often travelling long distances to deliver these services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are outstanding structural barriers that must be urgently addressed by government to help more rural families. The federal government provides significant funding to all our states and territories for hospital services, including maternity services. This funding needs to go to rural towns to ensure we have the services that these families rightly deserve. The Australian Rural Birthing Index is a tool created to ensure adequate services are available to expectant mothers in these regions. It's up to the Albanese Labor government to hold state and territory governments to account by tying funding to the rural birthing index to improve outcomes in regional areas and to not let their Labor mates in Queensland off the hook as they slash rural maternity services.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  Well, I'm perhaps not pleased to speak to the neglect of the health sector, including rural health care, since 1990. Obviously this is a slow-moving issue that has been a long time coming. I was one of those women living in a rural location when I had my babies in 1999. I lived in Karoonda, a town of 300 people in South Australia's Murray Mallee. Notably, my children represented a one per cent increase to the town's population when they were born. Of course, as a high-risk pregnancy, I was always going to have them in a high-risk clinic in a major tertiary hospital in the city, but postpartum care for me and my babies was provided in rural hospitals and rural general practices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The availability of women's health care, including but not limited to maternity care, is of vital importance to the status of women and the status of women's health across the country, and the Albanese Labor government recognises the importance of all women's healthcare needs, including but not limited to maternity care. After a decade of talk from those opposite about women's health, we're taking action. The 2024-25 federal budget has a significant focus on how the healthcare needs of women will be better met. We have committed over $160 million to tailor services, tackle healthcare bias and improve access to health care for women. Women's health and maternity health are not a one-size-fits-all exercise. Not only are there differences in the experiences of women in rural settings and women in cities; different women also have different preferences about how they want to experience their health care. Women have the right to exercise choice and control over their bodies, their healthcare experiences and their birthing experience. The Albanese government has recognised that a woman-centred continuous model of care offered by midwives is often the preferred model for many women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Childbirth is an intense and intensely personal experience. It can be exciting and also scary. The relationship a woman builds with her birthing team, often with her midwife in particular, is an important part of a positive birthing experience with a healthy outcome for mother, baby and the family as a whole. To give more women access to their choice of care during pregnancy, we've invested over $56.5 million to add new items to the Medicare Benefits Schedule to support access to more flexible, high-quality and tailored midwifery care. This includes longer antenatal and postnatal consultations—which can be important in difficult pregnancies, pregnancy complications—to ensure a healthy mother and a healthy baby or, in my case, babies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's investment will give women more choice and facilitate the building of relationships between mother and carer throughout the pregnancy journey. We're opening 12 perinatal mental health centres across the country to support women and families. The perinatal period can be a time of significant stress and change. A mentally healthy mum has positive benefits for the baby and for the family as a whole.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding to continue strategies to prevent preterm and early term birth in participating maternity services and First Nations communities will reduce the number of babies born too early. Preterm birth is not only associated with poorer birth outcomes but can affect the health of the baby their entire life, including in later adulthood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has developed the <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">centred care</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> strategic directions for </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">maternity services</span> to provide national strategic direction to support Australia's maternity care system and ensure it reflects contemporary practice. Australian families need to have access to safe, high-quality, respectful maternity care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Workforce shortages can affect the ability to access safe, quality maternity care. Strengthening maternity workforce supply, training and development is essential. The Australian government is collaborating closely with the state and territory governments to develop a national maternity workforce solution. Cost-of-living support for nurses and midwifery students undertaking mandatory placements as part of their studies will also assist in the workforce strategy, encouraging more students to take up nursing and midwifery and enabling them to complete their studies. I note that Flinders University, based in Boothby, provides training places for nursing students across rural South Australia and the Northern Territory. This is an important part of encouraging graduates to choose rural sites for their careers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a lot happening in this space after decades of neglect. It's about time health services for women got some focus, and this government is doing it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  In seconding this excellent motion by my colleague from Wide Bay, I do so as the shadow assistant minister for regional health and speak on behalf of the women of rural, regional and remote Australia who are victims of Labor's scorched earth approach to regional Australia. Talking about choice: many women face having to be away for the last six weeks or more of their pregnancy to ensure they can have a safe delivery. That is not to mention the strain the mothers' absence places mentally, emotionally and financially on her other children, on her partner, on her family and on her family business, such as the family farm. Fathers risk missing the birth of their child. If mothers remain at home, they risk having their baby outside a safe place for delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Blackall, Queensland the ABC reported in November that 20 women from the town with a population of 1½ thousand had given birth last calendar year, but none had been able to do so at their local non-birthing hospital. Mothers are expected to travel 200 kilometres away to Longreach or further afield. Reportedly, only seven of those women had their baby in Longreach and presumably gave birth even further away. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Epworth HealthCare in Geelong scheduled the closure of their maternity service in March last year. At one stage, St John of God Geelong Hospital was also facing being on bypass due, in part, to a lack of paediatricians in the area. A Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists spokesperson said in August that services in the greater Geelong region haven't kept pace with an increasing population, saying, 'The college is aware that St John of God Geelong Hospital and University Hospital Geelong have, at times over the last few months, been on bypass for maternity patients and babies and have needed to transfer patients for whom they would ordinarily be able to provide care.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't stop. In Whyalla, South Australia, the hospital was hit with a sudden closure of birthing services a year ago, requiring women to go a 76-kilometre additional distance to Port Augusta or, in some cases, almost 400 kilometres further, to Adelaide. Port Lincoln hospital does not have a full-time paediatrician, resulting in some mothers facing a 600-kilometre-plus trip to Adelaide to have their baby. Gladstone Hospital in Queensland was on bypass for over 11 months until last June, as had been both Biloela and Beaudesert hospitals that year. The absence of services in Gladstone and Biloela put additional pressure on Rockhampton's hospital birthing services. Also in Queensland, Innisfail, Mareeba, Ingham, Ayr and Dalby hospitals all had to suspend their birthing services for a few hours to several days in a 13-month period to last May. Imagine that on your last check-up. The situation was so bad that Queensland started offering $40,000 for GPs to train in obstetrics and offered interstate and overseas workers $70,000 to live in regional Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to a potential solution. A recently published study by Notre Dame university confirms that exposing doctors to rural practice in their early years, before they've made big decisions about marriage, mortgages and family, is crucial to keeping medics in the bush. The research followed 1,220 medical graduates from nine Australian universities to track where they were working five, eight and 10 years after graduation. General practitioner doctors were nearly three times more likely to be practising outside the cities after a decade, as the specialty has greater rural training opportunities. The majority, 71 per cent, of GPs who were in rural areas five years after graduation remained there at 10 years. This month, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Land </span>newspaper profiled Dr Clare Hardie, a GP-obstetrician who was doing a clinical placement in Narrogin in Western Australia's Wheatbelt in 2015 when, in her own words, 'I met a fella who is going to live rurally for the rest of his life, so I guess I'm stuck in Narrogin.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, rural, regional and remote Australians, particularly women, deserve better from their government. As the election approaches, I look forward to sharing policies to move swiftly to give regional Australians the health care they deserve.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  I thank the member for Wide Bay for raising this important issue and the constructive way in which he has raised it. There are few things more important than making sure women have access to safer health care for the birth of their precious baby. As the member for Wide Bay knows, the concerns that he highlights predate the election of the Labor government in 2022. I distinctly remember the massive cuts to rural public health under the coalition, of which the National Party was part. The first thing that the government that the Nationals were part of did was gut the body in charge of maintaining and improving rural health care. Does anybody remember the health consumers of rural and remote Australia? It's easier to silence criticism than respond to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, under the coalition's premiership, hospitals lost $57 billion in funding. That amounts to 37,000 fewer hospital beds or 68,000 fewer nurses or 33,000 fewer doctors. My neighbouring constituency of Bass—which Deputy Speaker Archer would be familiar with—saw $329 million taken from the LGH, exactly as planned. Between 2010 and 2021, most of that under the coalition rule, almost 140 rural hospitals across Australia closed. So no wonder there has been a reduction in rural maternity services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has referred previously to the recommendations within the Participating Midwife Reference Group report. It was published during the coalition government's term of office, and it's an excellent resource for the failings of the former government. The report noted that fewer than 10 per cent of women had access to continuous midwifery care and made several recommendations. It called for an increase in the number of midwives. That's what the Labor government has done. Labor will give every midwifery student $320 a week when on placements. That's on top of $50 million worth of scholarships. If you want to be a midwife, we will support you and we'll help you get there. The report called for the facilitation of telehealth consultations and the inclusion of GPs as eligible specialists, so that's what the Labor government has done. The sexual and reproductive telehealth item has been made permanent. This means more support for women in rural and remote areas to access reproductive health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now the big one: the report called for an end to the barriers to midwifery continuity of care, as did the member for Wide Bay. Specifically, it called for an end to mandated formal collaborative agreements. So that's what the Labor government has done. It was Labor's Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care who introduced the Health Legislation Amendment (Removal of Requirement for a Collaborative Arrangement) Bill in March. It does exactly what it says. It passed in March. I'm sure the member for Wide Bay was pleased with that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there's plenty left to do, which is why we are committed to getting qualified medical professionals including midwives into rural areas and getting them to stay. In our first budget in 2022, the Labor government created the Workforce Incentive Program for Rural Skills and this provides incentive payments for GPs in rural areas. The first payments were made this year. Labor also announced the John Flynn Prevocational Doctor Program, which increases the rotations of doctors and medical students to rural hospitals. It kicked off last year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just over the weekend we have announced $6 million dollars of funding towards the Birthing on Country Project in remote areas of the Northern Territory. Rates of prebirth for First Nations mothers is almost twice that of non-Indigenous mothers. This funding will close this gap and provide long-term employment for rural health workers, and do it all within the framework of First Nations culture. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">
                  </span>We are looking towards the future. That's why Labor introduced the Innovative Models of Care Program, which trials more efficient care practices in rural areas first. Some of that's underway in Tasmania. Rather than being afterthoughts, like under the former coalition government, rural hospitals under Labor are at the forefront of medical care. Labor has shown by our actions in just two years how importantly we take the issue of maternity services across rural and regional Australia. Not for a minute do we think the job is done, but I can assure the member for Wide Bay that the work is being done and actions are being taken. I look forward to his continued positive and constructive role in that effort. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  I thank the member for Wide Bay for this important motion and acknowledge his work and that of his office for the Parliamentary Friends of Maternal Health, of which the member and I are co-chairs, alongside the member for Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decline in maternity services in rural and remote Australia is of great concern to me and it's of great concern to the people of Indi who I represent. Before coming to this place I worked for decades as a midwife, and a large part of that time as a caseload continuity of care midwife. I saw firsthand the importance for mothers, fathers and babies of having maternity services close to home, and with midwives working to their full scope of practice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week I attended a community meeting in Mansfield, where locals expressed their opposition to proposed mergers of regional health services across Victoria. While these decisions will be made at a state level, it is really important for us here, as federal representatives, to understand what amalgamations could mean for maternity services. In Mansfield there is a real fear that if the health service was amalgamated, it wouldn't be long before it was seen as more efficient to centralise maternity services, with people forced to travel to Benalla or Shepparton or further afield to access maternity services and give birth. That would mean driving an hour away to give birth at a time when every minute counts. As the Mansfield GP-obstetrician, Dr Graham Slaney said, 'When maternity services are centralised, it is often the start of a cascading centralisation and reduction in other health services such as anaesthesia and surgery.' He added, 'Maternity services are a key drawcard in recruiting and retaining junior doctors, skilled midwives and nurses to our country towns.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need models of maternity care that enable women to give birth close to home. In 2021 the Rural Health Commissioner, Professor Ruth Stewart, described in an editorial:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… more than 225 rural maternity units closed in Australia between 1992 and 2011 (more than a 40% reduction). These closures occurred in the face of accumulated evidence that small maternity services in rural areas are at least as safe as larger maternity services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'This is a critical point,' she said, adding:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The narrative for closures is disconnected from the quality and safety evidence. These closures put birthing services further away for women in rural communities. Over those decades there was a 47% increase in babies born before arrival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially, that means on the side of the road. She continued:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Queensland Rural Maternity Taskforce noted an increased risk of birth before arrival at hospitals for women who live 1 hour or more or less than 2 hours from maternity services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've known for a very long time that birth in small rural hospitals is not associated with higher risk of poor outcomes compared to birth in larger centres. Decades ago, Professor Sally Tracey did a population based study of 750,000 women and proved this categorically.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs' report <span style="font-style:italic;">Ending the postcode lottery: Addressing barriers to sexual, maternity and reproductive healthcare in Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>found that, when women don't have access to maternity care that meets their needs within a reasonable travel time, there are consequences. International research has backed this up, associating travel time exceeding one hour with poorer outcomes for mothers and their babies as well as with increased interventions in childbirth. This is at a time when we are trying to get childbirth to have as few interventions as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian women have repeatedly called for continuity of care and carer access to evidence to make informed choices and to choose the model of care and make those choices collaboratively with their care providers. We have overwhelming evidence about the positive outcomes for mothers and babies through midwife led continuity-of-care models, countless RCTs, Cochrane reviews and growing evidence that, in fact, good investment from this government now has positive outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women through birthing-on-country programs. But models such as these should not be the exception; they should be the rule.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion calls for the removal of structural barriers to women receiving primary care, and I want to acknowledge that this government has done some great work in this area, the removal of collaborative agreements for nurse practitioners and midwives accessing Medicare being one example. But there's more to do, and an urgent piece of work right now is to address the issue of professional indemnity insurance for midwives. We know that in the federal budget there were some big investments announced for midwifery, including claim costs for indemnity insurance. We need to make sure we get this right and that we don't exclude women from home birth under this insurance arrangement. We need to be careful about the term 'low risk'. We need to get it right and consult carefully.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  I rise to speak on this important motion. The health status of all people is influenced by cultural, political, environmental and economic determinants. A true partnership approach not only builds a stronger health system but, importantly, ensures it is equipped to better meet the complex and multilayered health challenges facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly in my electorate of Lingiari. Nowhere is this more evident than in maternal health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NT Aboriginal women and their babies experience poorer health outcomes compared to non-Indigenous mothers and their babies. The rate of preterm birth is almost double that of non-Indigenous mums, and birthing-on-country models of care directly contribute to closing the gap in this critical area of health policy. The birthing and health centre in Galiwinku in the Northern Territory is an innovative, solution-focused project that supports Yolngu women's self-determination and control over their reproductive health as well as improved maternal health outcomes, with more babies born at healthy birth weight. This project will also create long-term employment for a Yolngu women's workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congress alukura, or birthing-by-grandmothers law, has been an important feature in Alice Springs for many decades. Recently, a new alukura birthing service has been opened by the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress. The Alukura Midwifery Group Practice allows women to keep the same midwife through their pregnancy and birth. Through a partnership with the Alice Springs Hospital, women can now have their congress midwife alongside them up to and during the birth of their child at the hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Birthing on country gives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies and their families, most particularly their mums, the best start in life. For more than 60,000 years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women have birthed their babies on traditional lands. Future generations of women and babies will thrive and flourish through a holistic approach to health that incorporates traditional practice, through connection with land and country, with Western knowledge systems of medicine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking about this important issue, I want to acknowledge all the nurses, midwives, doctors and specialists that play a vital role for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in making sure that mums end up with healthy babies. I want to take what time I have to pay tribute to the important work and dedication over many years of two women in particular: Molly Wardaguga and Professor Sue Kildea. Molly, who I met many years ago, in the early 2000s, was an Aboriginal health worker who delivered many of the young people that we see around Maningrida. Professor Sue Kildea was an avid young nurse at that time—and she'd probably kill me for saying that—at Maningrida, in the Northern Territory. I have recently spoken to Sue, who has continued this passionate work of Molly, who passed in the early 2000s. Sue has continued to advocate the work and the Birthing on Country program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to acknowledge many of our RNs that are working tirelessly in the Northern Territory with community controlled Aboriginal health services to turn around the low birth rates and to look at its importance and how we can advance birthing and health centres in Galiwin'ku. Women on Christmas and Cocos have also raised with me some of the barriers that they face, such as having to come off the island and move to Perth, thousands of kilometres away from their families, to have their children. Often that can come at great expense to those families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish this speech by saying that every woman deserves a choice in their birthing journey, and it doesn't matter whether they're Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, they're non-Aboriginal women or they're Muslim women. It does not matter who we are; I think all women deserve a choice in their birthing journey.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  I thank the member for Lingiari for her insightful words. She, as much as anybody, would know how difficult it is for women, particularly for Aboriginal women, in her sprawling Northern Territory electorate to give birth. Having a baby can be very stressful for mothers, and I commend the member for Wide Bay for bringing this motion to this House. It notes 'the reduction in the provision of maternity services in rural Australia', and that is so very much so, unfortunately. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Within the current Riverina electorate boundaries, five towns are of a size where you would think there would be good and modern maternity services, but there are none at all. This forces expectant mothers to, in some cases, drive hours upon hours to get to a hospital, and in this day and age that is simply not good enough. Parkes, West Wyalong, Junee, Gundagai and Harden-Murrumburrah have no maternity services. The Parkes maternity ward closed in June 2019 due to a lack of doctors. The mayor in Parkes, Neil Westcott, bemoaned to me only the other day that, for a town the size of 12,000 people, they deserve better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cootamundra community was told just last month that maternity services will be off the table under proposed changes under the Murrumbidgee Local Health District's draft health services plan for the Cootamundra health service. This was on public display until yesterday. I've spoken to the Cootamundra-Gundagai mayor, Councillor Charlie Sheahan, who actually ran for state Labor. He shares his community's extreme concerns—and they're mine as well; I share those views—that the draft will become the plan and will leave his community, the Cootamundra community, devastated. He's right, and it's simply not good enough. No country town should have any health services reduced, let alone a town the size of Cootamundra. It has 7,153 people, and they deserve better. It's got an encouraging projected population growth on the back of projects such as the planned expansion of the local meatworks, and, as Councillor Sheahan said to me, this could attract thousands more residents to the district. Why should people living in rural and regional areas have fewer and inferior services to Australians living in metropolitan areas? There's no right or proper answer to that question. They simply should not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've written to the Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Health and, whilst I appreciate that this is very much at the feet of the Minns state government, I felt compelled to raise this issue with Minister McBride to impress upon her the importance of, at the very least, maintaining health services in regional and rural areas, because that is her portfolio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the Cootamundra community has been told that pathology, maternity and surgery are not going to happen any longer under these proposed changes, and it's simply not good enough. I can't express that enough. I really criticise the Minns government for doing this at a time when Cootamundra's projected population is growing. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Advertiser</span> newspaper on 21 May, under the heading '"Short-sighted" plan leaves community uneasy over hospital's future', talked about fears of vital local health care having cuts spreading across the community. The article said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A MLHD spokesperson said a health service plan outlines the services required to reflect the community's health needs into the future and makes recommendations about the best way to deliver these services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's great, but come on. Let's face it: these communities are growing. All the LGAs in my area are growing, and yet, if it truly reflects the community's health needs, why take it away? Why cut it? It makes no sense.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Spokesperson said the Murrumbidgee Local Health District, like other health districts, regularly updates its health service plans to ensure they accurately reflect the health needs of individual communities. It does not accurately reflect the health needs of the community when you've got a growing community with mums who want to give birth in their home towns but are forced to drive hours away to give birth in Wagga Wagga or elsewhere. It's simply not good enough, and these bureaucrats should pull their bloody heads in and realise that this community needs maternity services. They need them now and they need them going into the future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  There is nothing more important than bringing a new human into this world. It is vital that women have access to the best possible maternity services, whether they live in my electorate of the Hunter, the member for Sydney's electorate or the electorate of New England. The risk to mother and baby should not depend on where you live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Health care and especially the topic of women's health care is something that is at the top of the list of priorities for any Labor government. We recognise and we understand how important maternity care is, and we know how important all women's healthcare needs are. We showed this in the last budget, where we had a major focus on how the healthcare needs of women can be better met. We've invested $160 million to tailor services, tackle bias and improve access for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also focused on making sure that expecting mothers are better looked after on one of the most important days of their lives. We are doing this by investing over $56.5 million to add new items to the Medicare benefits schedule to support access to more flexible, high-quality and tailored midwifery care. This includes longer postnatal consultations. This includes giving more women access to the care of their choice during pregnancy. A woman-centred, continuous model of care offered by midwives is often the preferred model for many women. This investment will give women more choice and facilitate the building of relationships between mother and carer throughout the pregnancy journey, which is an important part of making sure women have access to the maternity service that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that there are very particular issues when it comes to giving birth in regional areas. That's why we have committed funding to continue strategies to prevent preterm and early term birth in particular maternity services and First Nations communities, which will help to reduce the number of babies born too early.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that, when a woman is pregnant, she is the centre of everything that happens. This is the way it should be, and this is why we have developed <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman-centred care: strategic directions for Australian maternity services</span>, to provide direction on a national scale to support Australia's maternity care system and make sure it reflects the way that care should be given in the modern day. Regardless of where you live, Australian families need to have access to safe, high-quality, respectful maternity care. As long as we're in government, we will fight for this every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we're going to make sure that women in rural areas have access to the high-quality maternity services that they need, we need to take a good look at the issues they are currently facing and the barriers that are preventing people in rural areas from accessing these services. One of the biggest issues is workforce shortages. These workforce shortages can affect the ability to access safe, quality maternity care. If there are no midwives, there can be no maternity services. To fix these workforce shortages, we need to strengthen the supply of those in the maternity workforce. This can't be done without a focus on training and development. If there are more people trained to provide maternity services, there will be more women across Australia in our rural communities who will have access to the services that they need and deserve. We are aware of the need to increase the workforce and increase the number of people who are trained to provide these services, and we are acting to make a difference. All Australian governments are collaborating closely to develop national maternity workforce solutions. We are working with the states to make sure that these issues are addressed so that women nationwide are better supported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a dad and I know what it's like to be expecting a child, but obviously I don't know what it's like to be carrying one. But the one thing I do know is that it can be an extremely stressful and difficult time for many expecting mothers in all kinds of different situations. So providing maternity services goes far beyond just giving birth. The support needs to be available the whole way through the process, and that's why we're opening 12 perinatal mental health centres across the country to support women and families. We are a government that cares about families, women and their health, and our track record proves that.</span>
